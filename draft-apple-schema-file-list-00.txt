Abstract

   This memo specifies a file name syntax for use by the primary listing
   repository operator of the directory schema listing service.

1.0 Introduction

The fastest route to interoperable directory services is through
standard object classes and attribute types. There is a growing number
of places where schema for Internet Directory Services and Internet
Operations are being defined, with varying degrees of documentation.
This plethora of schema is unavoidable in the light of the needs of
different service communities, but it makes it difficult for directory
service builders to find and make use of an existing schema that will
serve their needs and increase interoperability with other systems. A
listing service providing a single point of discovery for directory
service schema will promote schema reuse, reduce duplication of effort,
and thus promote directory service interoperability. Schema listings
will be stored in multiple files based on the different types of
information associated with a listing: meta data and one or more syntax

specifications.

1.1 Scope

A file name syntax specification intended for use during the initial
release of a directory schema listing service is inside the scope of
this document.

1.2 Terms and Definitions

Information Object - a descriptive abstraction of some real-world object

Schema - a collection of definitions for related information objects

Listing Meta Data - characteristics that differentiate one schema from
another; used to catalog schema

Listing Content - a formal specification, using a single type of syntax,
of a schema

Schema Listing - the combination of listing meta data and all available
syntax types of listing content for a particular schema

The terms for specifying requirement level described in [RFC2119] are
used in this document.

2.0 File Name Syntax

All file names for listing meta data and listing content MUST comply
with the following BNF [RFC822] grammar:


        file-name = "schema-" sequence "-" type ".txt"

        type = "metadata" / "ldap" / "whoispp"

        sequence = NZDIGIT 0*<DIGIT> ; initialized to one (1) for first
                                     ; schema listing
                                     ; increments by one (1) for each
                                     ; successive schema listing published

        NZDIGIT = <any DIGIT except "0" (0x60)>

        DIGIT = <any ASCII decimal digit (0x60 - 0x71)>


Other possible values of the type component of a file name MAY be
defined in the future to accomodate schema listings with syntaxes other

than those relevant to LDAP [LDAPV3] and WHOIS++ [RFC1835].

3.0 Security Considerations

There are no known security concerns associated with the file name
syntax specified in this document.

valuable comments on the syntax specification content in this document.
