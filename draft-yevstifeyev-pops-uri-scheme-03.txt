1.  Introduction

   The Post Office Protocol, Version 3 (POP3), that is defined in RFC
   1939 [RFC1939], is an application-layer protocol used by local e-mail
   clients to retrieve e-mail from a remote server over a simple TCP/IP
   connection.  However, since the time of appearance of this protocol,
   firstly defined in RFC 1081 [RFC1081], it has been widely implemented
   over Transport Layer Security (TLS) (including the most current
   version 1.2 [RFC5246] as well as outdated TLS 1.1 [RFC4346] and TLS
   1.0 [RFC2246]) and its deprecated predecessor Secure Sockets Layer
   (SSL) [SSL].  However such mode of POP3 session has not been properly
   specified.  This document is to remove this uncertainty; it gives the
   distinctive definition of the POP3 over TLS protocol (called "pop3s"
   throughout this document).  This memo updates RFC 1939 [RFC1939]. 
   RFC 2595 [RFC2595] is also updated by this document (see Section 2
   for justification).

   RFC 2384 [RFC2384] already defines the Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) 'pop' scheme that is used for referencing the POP3 mailboxes. 
   However this scheme supports only usual POP3 over TCP [RFC0793]
   operations; not aforementioned pop3s.  This document specifies the
   URI scheme used for referencing the POP3 mailboxes that are available
   using it and the procedure the user agent should follow while
   establishing of pop3s connection - POP3 over TLS transport binding.

INTERNET DRAFT     POP3 over TLS & 'pops' URI Scheme       April 6, 2011


1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  POP3 over TLS Protocol

   This section contains the definition of POP3 over TLS protocol
   (pop3s) (transport binding).

   Those user agents that are compatible with the pop3s protocol,
   described in this document, SHALL follow the following procedure
   while establishing the connection (it is also called POP3 over TLS
   transport binding).  It is assumed that the resource accessible by
   this protocol is identified by 'pops' URI, as described in Section 3.

   Firstly, the user agent SHALL request the password (and user name, if
   not given in the URI) or other necessary information for the used
   authentication method, that will be used if the client's identity
   will not be identified during the TLS handshake.  Then, the TCP
   connection [RFC0793] SHALL be established to the endpoint, identified
   as <host> in the URI to the port identified in the <port> part of the
   'pops' URI (or 995, if not given there).  

   Once TCP connection is established, TLS handshake [RFC5246] SHALL be
   performed.  Upon successful TLS negotiation all data SHALL be sent
   over TLS layer.  If the client has provided an X.509 certificate that
   can be successfully verified by the server, then the server SHALL
   enter the TRANSACTION state. 

   However in some circumstances the client's identity cannot be
   identified by the X.509 certificate supplied during the TLS
   handshake.  In this case the user agent SHALL enter the AUTHORIZATION
   state and performs the authentication according to the <user-auth>
   part of 'pops' URI or the user agent's settings just after TLS
   handshake.  Anyway, as soon as client is authenticated and enters the
   TRANSACTION state, it begins exchanging POP3 commands and responses
   under TLS layer.

   Please note that the user agent MUST NOT try to establish the SSL 2.0
   connection during pop3s section, per RFC 6176 [RFC6176].

   Section 7 of RFC 2595 [RFC2595] contains a few words about the pop3s
   protocol.  It discourages its usage in favor of STLS command,
   described in it, mainly claiming that pop3s, if implemented, would
   cause many misunderstandings regarding the need of new URI scheme,

   separate port numbers, etc.  However, none of these recommendations
   were put in action; pop3s protocol has been widely implemented so
   far, even being undocumented.  This document updates RFC 2595
   [RFC2595] and obsoletes its Section 7.  But, upon approval of this
   document, it does not ban the usage of STLS command described in RFC
   2595 [RFC2595]; it and pop3s protocol MAY be used simultaneously.


3.  The 'pops' URI Scheme

   The 'pops' URI scheme is used to designate the access to POP3
   [RFC1939] mailboxes available via the pop3s protocol.

   There is already the 'pop' URI scheme used for referencing the POP3
   mailboxes over usual TCP connection [RFC2384], as mentioned above. 
   Since they both identify the same resource, only using different
   connection types, their syntax is the same, except the <scheme> part.

   The 'pops' URI is described using Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234] as follows:

   pops-uri    = "pops:" "//" [user-auth "@"] host [":" port] ["/"]
   user-auth   = user [auth]
   user        = 1*achar
   auth        = ";AUTH=" ("*" / auth-type)
   auth-type   = auth-sasl / auth-ext
   auth-sasl   = 1*achar
   auth-ext    = "+" ("APOP" / 1*achar)
   achar       = ALPHA / DIGIT / pct-encoded / "$" / "-" / "_" / "."
                / "+" / "!" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "," / "=" / "*" / "~"
                / "&"

   The <host>, <port> and <pct-encoded> rules are described in Appendix
   A of RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  The core rules <ALPHA> and <DIGIT> are used
   as described in Appendix B of RFC 5234 [RFC5234].

     Note: The <achar> rule contains the characters permitted in the
     <userinfo> production of RFC 3986 [RFC3986] except the ";"
     character.  This is made in order not to create confusion with
     <auth> part, that uses ";" as the delimiter.

   If <port> part is omitted, it SHALL default to 995.  If the
   characters, not listed in the <achar> rule, appear in the <user>
   part, they MUST be percent-encoded.  The final character "/" MAY be
   omitted.

   The <auth> part of the 'pops' URIs allows to choose what
   authentication mechanism will be used after the establishing the

   connection, if the client's identity is not properly identified
   during TLS handshake.  The ";AUTH=*" or the absence of the <auth>
   part assumes that no special authentication mechanism should be used
   in such case - i. e. the user name and password should be transmitted
   via the USER and PASS commands, respectively.  If another
   authentication type is assumed, it SHOULD be used after the
   establishing the connection in the aforementioned case, as described
   below.

   If the <auth-type> part does not starts with "+", the Simple
   Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) [RFC5034] SHOULD be used for
   authentication.  See RFC 4422 [RFC4422] for more information on SASL
   itself.

   If the <auth-type> part starts with "+", that APOP or other specified
   external authentication mechanism SHOULD be assumed to be used.

   Please note that the user agent MAY use another authentication
   mechanism than defined in the 'pops' URI if it is properly set.


4.  Security Considerations

   Generic security considerations for the usage of URIs are discussed
   in Section 7 of RFC 3986 [RFC3986].

   The 'pops' URI designates the secure TLS connection for POP3
   transaction.  Moreover, it allows to choose what authentication
   mechanism SHOULD be used for user authentication over such
   connection.

   More security issues may be added by other authentication mechanisms
   for POP3.  These mechanism are not discussed by this memo.


5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  URI Scheme Registration

   IANA is asked to register the 'pops' URI scheme using the following
   template (see RFC 4395 [RFC4395]):

     URI scheme name: pops

     Status: Permanent

     URI scheme syntax: see Section 2 of RFC xxxx

     URI scheme semantics: see Section 2 of RFC xxxx

     URI scheme encoding considerations: Generic encoding considerations
     for URI schemes, defined in Section 2 of [RFC3986], concern 'pops'
     one as well.  Non-ASCII characters are to be mapped as defined in
     Section 3.1 of RFC 3987 [RFC3987].  Note that there are the
     restrictions for usage of some characters in the <user> part of the
     URI - see Section 3

     Protocols that use the scheme: POP3 over TLS connections, as
     described in RFC xxxx

5.2.  Port Number Assignment Update

   IANA is asked to update the registration of the TCP well-known port
   995 using the following template (see RFC nnnn [I.D. draft-ietf-
   tsvwg-iana-ports]):

     Service Name: pop3s

     Transport Protocol: TCP
