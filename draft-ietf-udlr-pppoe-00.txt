INTERNET-DRAFT          Using PPPoE with LLTM             November 2001

  
   
   
1. Introduction
   
   The initial idea was to create a real satellite local loop where a 
   satellite broadband Internet access can replace a terrestrial one 
   in areas that are non covered by terrestrial high speed Internet 
   access such as ADSL. This architecture remains open and in order 
   to provide the same type of services than in ADSL networks, an
   interconnection with a Broadband Access Server (BAS) is needed.
   This interconnection uses the PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet).
   
   This document explains the advantages of the PPPoE and LLTM [RFC 3077] 
   in such a satellite Local Loop : compatibility with all IP world and 
   performances equivalent to ADSL. It also shows the possible 
   evolutions of this architecture.

INTERNET-DRAFT          Using PPPoE with LLTM             November 2001


2.1. Equipments description

   Here are the description of the main equipments of this 
   architecture :
   
   - the end user is a PC on a LAN.
   It integrates an Ethernet card.

   - the satellite terminal is a router with an LLTM client 
   (implementing the RFC 3077).
   It integrates one satellite reception card, one Ethernet card 
   and one bidirectional interface connected to the Internet.

   Firstly, it transports the traffic from the end users to
   the Internet via the return channel which can be either
   satellite or terrestrial.

   Secondly, it receives traffic from the DVB channel
   (previously coming from the Internet) via its DVB interface
   and deliver it to the end users. 

   - the LLTM server (implementing the RFC 3077) is acting as 
     an Ethernet bridge.

   This is the endpoint of the GRE tunnel where traffic is 
   encapsulated and decapsulated. The LLTM server is 
   directly connected to a BAS.


   - the BAS (Broadband Access Server) manages the PPPoE connection.
   The PPPoE can end into the BAS (open model) or continue and end into
   the RADIUS server of an ISP (closed model). The PPPoE authentication
   is done where the PPPoE tunnel ends.



2.2 Connections description (Unicast)

   
   Here are the different steps of a connection to Internet :

   	- when an end user tries to go on the Internet, the satellite 
	terminal implements the LLTM : it initiates first a GRE tunnel 
        between its DVB interface and the LLTM server. Now a LAN has 
        been emulated and all the Ethernet frames can be directed to 
        the LLTM server and therefore to the BAS.

INTERNET-DRAFT          Using PPPoE with LLTM             November 2001

 

	- the satellite terminal exchanges pieces of information with
	the BAS (initiation session) in order to initiate the PPPoE
	session.

	- In case of cloded model the BAS redirect the PPP connection 
        to the right ISP through a L2TP tunnel.

	- the end user can connect to a distant server of the Internet.



2.3 Multicast

  
   It is important to notice that PPPoE supports only PPP connection for 
   Unicast flows. The multicast is provided directly by the ASP using IP 
   over LLTM. In this configuration, the ASP can offer n to m multicast 
   services.
   There is also possibility to offer the Mbone connectity through the BAS 
   without using PPPoE.


3. Advantages
   

   
   The Local Satellite Loop architecture offers the following advantages :

		
	- a return channel flexibility : the use of LLTM allows to 
	define an access network wether with a satellite return channel
	or with a terrestrial return channel. Besides a standby
	terrestrial link can be used automatically in case of failure 
	of the satellite return channel.


	- a multi-ISP configuration for the Internet access.

	- a difference is made between the ASP and the ISP

	- complementarity with the ADSL network :
		* performances : more than 128 kbps for the return channel
		and up to 40 Mbps for a gateway throughput
		* client segmentation : corporate or residential
		* interconnection with the terrestrial network
		* reduction of the access costs
		* re-use of the ADSL management system (accounting,
		billing, etc.)

        - interactif Multicast support (m to m)

4. Conclusion
   

The Local Satellite Loopb architecture has been already validated in laboratory. 
A real experimentation will begin on the fourth quarter of 2001 with a few tens 
of satellite terminals. Different evolutions are studied on multicast and security
aspects.
