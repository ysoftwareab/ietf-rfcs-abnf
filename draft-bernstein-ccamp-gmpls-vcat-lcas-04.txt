1. Introduction 

   The Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) suite of 
   protocols allows the automated control of different switching 
   technologies including SONET/SDH.   

   This document describes extensions to RSVP-TE to support the Virtual 
   Concatenation (VCAT) layer 1 inverse multiplexing mechanism and its 
   companion Link Capacity Adjustment Scheme (LCAS).  These extensions 
   enable the setup of diversely routed circuits that are members of the 
   same VCAT group. 

2. Changes from draft-bernstein-ccamp-gmpls-vcat-lcas-03

   o  Updated references

   o  Many editorial changes throughout the document 

   o  Rewrote the introduction 

3. VCAT/LCAS Scenarios and Specific Requirements 

   There are a number of specific requirements for the support of 
   VCAT/LCAS in GMPLS that can be derived from the carriers' 
   application-specific demands for the use of VCAT/LCAS and from the 
   flexible nature of VCAT/LCAS.  These are set out in the following 
   section. 

3.1. Multiple VCAT Groups per GMPLS Endpoint  

   In general, an LSR can be ingress/egress of one or more VCAT groups.  
   VCAT and LCAS are interface capabilities.  An LSR may have, for 
   example, VCAT-capable interfaces that are not LCAS-capable.  It may 
   at the same time have interfaces that are neither VCAT nor LCAS-
   capable.

3.2. Component Signal Configuration Requirements 

   We list in this section the different scenarios that SHOULD be 
   supported.  Here we use the term "VCG" to refer to the entire VCAT 
   group and the terminology "set" and "subset" to refer to the 
   collection of potential VCAT group member signals. 

   o  Fixed, co-routed: A fixed bandwidth VCG, transported over a co-
      routed set of member signals.  This is the case where the intended 
      bandwidth of the VCG does not change and all member signals follow 
      the same route and minimize differential delay.  The intent here 
      is the capability to allocate an amount of bandwidth close to that 
      required at the client layer. 

   o  Fixed, diversely routed: A fixed bandwidth VCG, transported over 
      at least two diversely routed subsets of member signals.  In this 
      case, the subsets are link-disjoint over at least one link of the 
      route.  The intent here is more efficient use of network resources 
      (no unique route has the required bandwidth), and additional 
      resilience and graceful degradation in the case of failure (note 
      that differential delay may be a limiting factor). 

   o  Dynamic, co-routed: A dynamic VCG (bandwidth can be increased or 
      decreased via the addition or removal of member signals), 
      transported over a co-routed set of members.  Intent here is 
      dynamic sizing of bandwidth. 

   o  Dynamic, diversely routed: A dynamic VCAT group, transported over 
      at least two diversely routed subsets of member signals.  The 
      intent here is dynamic resizing and resilience (but differential 
      delay may be a limiting factor). 

3.3. VCAT Operation With or Without LCAS 

   VCAT capabilities may be present with or without the presence of 
   LCAS.  The use of LCAS is beneficial to the provision of services, 
   but in the absence of LCAS, VCAT is still a valid technique.  
   Therefore GMPLS mechanisms for the operation of VCAT are REQUIRED for 
   both the case where LCAS is available and the case where it is not 
   available.  The GMPLS procedures for the two cases SHOULD be 
   identical. 

4. GMPLS Mechanisms for Signaling VCAT/LCAS 

   We describe in this section the signaling mechanisms that already 
   exist in GMPLS using RSVP-TE [RFC3473] and the extensions needed, for 
   diversely routed paths and in support of the LCAS procedure.

   Section 4.1 is included for informational purposes only.  It 
   describes existing procedures and makes no changes. 

   Section 4.2 describes new procedures to support diversely routed VCAT 
   groups.  Where possible it reuses applicable existing procedures from 
   section 4.1.  

4.1. Co-Routed Signals 

   Note that this section is for informational purposes only. 

   The existing signaling protocols support co-routed signal setup using 
   the NVC field as explained in section 2.1 of [RFC3946bis].  In this 
   case, one single LSP is set up in support of the VCAT group. 

   There are two options for setting up the VCAT group, depending on 
   hardware capability, or management preferences: one-shot setup and 
   incremental setup. 

   The following sections explain the procedure based on an example of 
   setting up a VC4-7v SDH VCAT group (corresponding to an STS-3c-7v 
   SONET VCAT group). 

4.1.1. One-shot Setup of Co-Routed Signal 

   An RSVP-TE Path message is used with the following parameters. 

   With regards to the traffic parameters, the elementary signal is 
   chosen (6 for VC-4/STS-3c_SPE).  The value of NVC is then set to 7. 

   A Multiplier Transform greater than 1 (say N>1) is used if the 
   operator wants to set up N VCAT groups that will belong to, and be 
   assigned to, one LSP. 

   SDH or SONET labels in turn have to be assigned for each member of 
   the VCG and concatenated to form a single Generalized Label 
   constructed as an ordered list of 32-bit timeslot identifiers of the 
   same format as TDM labels.  [RFC3946bis] requires that the order of 
   the labels reflect the order of the payloads to concatenate, and not 
   the physical order of time-slots. 

4.1.2. Incremental Setup of Co-Routed Signal 

   In some cases, it may be necessary or desirable to set up the VCG 
   members individually, or to add group members to an existing group. 


 
 
Bernstein              Expires February 4, 2007                [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft    Operating VCAT and LCAS with GMPLS        August 2006 
    

   One example of this need is when the hardware that supports VCAT can 
   only add VCAT elements one at a time or cannot automatically match 
   the elements at the ingress and egress for the purposes of inverse 
   multiplexing.  Serial or incremental setup solves this problem. 

   In order to accomplish incremental setup an iterative process is used 
   to add group members.  For each iteration, NVC is incremented up to 
   the final value required.  The iteration consists of the successful 
   completion of Path and Resv signaling.  At first, NVC = 1 and the 
   label includes just one timeslot identifier  

   At each of the next iterations, NVC is set to (NVC +1), one more 
   timeslot identifier is added to the ordered list in the Generalized 
   Label (in the Path or Resv message).  A node that receives a Path 
   message that contains changed fields will process the full Path 
   message and, based on the new value of NVC, it will add a component 
   signal to the VCAT group, and switch the new timeslot based on the 
   new label information. 

   Following the addition of the new label to the LSP, LCAS may be used 
   in-band to add the new label into the existing VCAT group.  LCAS 
   signaling for this function is described in [ITU-T-G.7042]. 

4.1.3. Removing a Component Signal 

   The procedure to remove a component signal is similar to that used to 
   add components as described in Section 4.1.2.  The LCAS in-band 
   signaling step is taken first to take the component out of the group.  
   LCAS signaling is described in [ITU-T-G.7042]. 

   In this case, the NVC value is decremented by 1 and the timeslot 
   identifier for the dropped component is removed from the ordered list 
   in the Generalized Label.  This function is not supported without 
   management intervention for VCAT-only interfaces as removing one 
   component of the VCG will result in errors in the inverse-
   multiplexing procedure of VCAT and result in the teardown of the 
   whole group.  So, this is a feature that only LCAS-capable VCAT 
   interfaces can support without management intervention at the end 
   points. 

4.1.4. Removing Multiple Component Signals in One Shot 

   The procedure is similar to 4.1.3.  In this case, the NVC value is 
   changed to the new value and all relevant timeslot identifiers for 
   the components to be torn down are removed from the ordered list in 
   the Generalized Label.  This is also not supported for VCAT-only 
   interfaces without management intervention as removing one component

   of the VCG will tear down the whole group, but the use of LCAS can 
   facilitate this procedure. 

4.1.5. Use of multiple LSPs for Co-Routed Signals 

   Co-routed signals may also be supported by distinct LSPs signaled 
   separately using exactly the techniques described for diversely 
   routed signals in Section 4.2. 

4.1.6. Teardown of Whole VCG 

   The entire LSP is deleted in a single step (i.e., all components are 
   removed in one go) using deletion procedures of [RFC3473]. 

4.2. Diversely Routed Signals 

   The initial GMPLS specification did not support diversely routed 
   signals using the NVC construct.  In fact, [RFC3946bis] says: 

         [...] The standard definition for virtual concatenation allows 
         each virtual concatenation components to travel over diverse 
         paths.  Within GMPLS, virtual concatenation components must 
         travel over the same (component) link if they are part of the 
         same LSP.  This is due to the way that labels are bound to a 
         (component) link.  Note however, that the routing of components 
         on different paths is indeed equivalent to establishing 
         different LSPs, each one having its own route.  Several LSPs 
         can be initiated and terminated between the same nodes and 
         their corresponding components can then be associated together 
         (i.e., virtually concatenated). 

   Diverse routing of signals can be a useful capability but requires 
   the extensions identified in this document. 

4.2.1. Associating Diversely Routed Signals 

   The feature that needs to be added is the functionality to associate 
   the components of the same VCG.  For this purpose, we use the 
   Association Object that was defined in [E2E-RECOVERY] to associate 
   working and recovery LSPs. 

   A diversely routed VCG uses a number of routes R <= VCG size, as some 
   routes may be the same for several components.  A number of LSPs, L 
   (VCG >= L >= R) are used with each LSP establishing at least one 
   component of the VCG, and at most all of the co-routed members of the 
   group.  For a set of c components using the same route, we set up the 
   LSP with NVC = c exactly as explained in section 4.1.1.  Therefore, 
 
 
Bernstein              Expires February 4, 2007                [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft    Operating VCAT and LCAS with GMPLS        August 2006 
    

   the association of group members or of sub-groups to form the VCG 
   requires the association of the LSPs used to establish the group 
   members. 

   To be able to distinguish the LSPs in the VCG each must have a unique 
   identifier. LSPs are identified by the combination of Session and 
   Sender Template fields.  It is common practice when make-before-break 
   [RFC3209] is supported to allow LSPs with the same Session, but 
   different Sender Templates (specifically with different LSP IDs) to 
   share resources.  Since resource sharing between VCG members must not 
   be allowed (because we want each LSP to contribute capacity to the 
   VCG), but since we want to continue to support make-before-break for 
   each group member, it is necessary to distinguish the LSPs in the VCG 
   by varying the fields in the Session object.  Specifically, a 
   different Tunnel ID is used to identify each LSP in the VCG. 

   Thus, VCG members cannot be associated through the Session object, 
   and the Association object is used instead. 

   The assignment of the Association ID is outside the scope of GMPLS 
   but MUST be unique for each VCAT group. 

   Note that the use of the Association object to associate members of a 
   VCG does not preclude the use of another instance of the object with 
   a different Association ID to indicate the association of working and 
   recovery LSPs, as [E2E-RECOVERY] allows the use of multiple 
   Association objects.  We differentiate between the Association 
   objects used for the VCAT group and other Association objects through 
   the definition of a new association type to indicate that this is a 
   VCG association. 

   Association Type: 16 bits  

               Value       Type  
               -----       ----  

                 3         VCAT group  

   See [E2E-RECOVERY] for the definition of other fields and values of 
   the Association object. 

4.2.2. Procedures for VCG Setup Using Diversely Routed Components 

   For every route R, use the procedure outlined in section 4.1.1 or 
   4.1.2 depending on the capability of the equipment or local policy.  
   The Path message MUST include the Association object with type set to 
   3, and each Path message MUST use the same Association ID.

Internet-Draft    Operating VCAT and LCAS with GMPLS        August 2006 
    

   Following the addition of each new LSP (i.e., once the RESV message 
   has been received by the ingress LSR), LCAS signaling is used in-band 
   to hitlessly add the new label into the existing group [ITU-T-
   G.7042]. 

4.2.3. Procedures for VCG Reduction/Teardown Using Diversely Routed 
   Components 

   To remove the component circuits on any route, LCAS signaling is used 
   in-band to remove the labels associated with the LSP from the group.  
   LCAS signaling is defined in [ITU-T-G.7042]. 

   In addition, the procedures outlined in section 4.1.3 or 4.1.4 are 
   used to tear down the unwanted LSP.  

   Again, this can only be done on LCAS-capable interfaces.  If the 
   procedure is attempted on VCAT-only interfaces, then the whole VCG is 
   torn down (this is not a graceful teardown so ingress/egress initiate 
   a Path Tear/Resv Tear) on all routes. 

4.2.4. Update of Already Established LSPs 

   Established co-routed VCAT groups currently do not support the 
   Association object.  If a co-routed VCAT Group size is to be 
   increased with new diversely routed members, we use the LSP 
   modification procedure described in [RFC2205].  An Association object 
   is added to the Path message for the existing LSP(s).  That 
   Association object can then be used to set up new diversely routed 
   group members. 

   The same applies to SONET/SDH LSPs.  An operator may decide to use an 
   already cross-connected SONET/SDH LSP for diversely-routed VCAT.  In 
   this case the modification procedure described in [RFC2205] is used 
   as well. 

4.2.5. One LSP per Circuit 

   These procedures can support the use of as many LSPs as there are 
   circuits in the VCG.  This can be done when each circuit is 
   separately routed, or when some of the circuits are co-routed, and 
   each LSP will be used to set up one element of the VCG.  The 
   Association object is used to indicate the VCG association.

5. IANA Considerations 

   This document requests from IANA the assignment of a new Association 
   Type within the Association object.  This object was defined in [E2E-
   RECOVERY]. 

   The value 3 "VCAT group" is suggested in section 4.2.1.  

6. Security Considerations 

   This document introduces a new use of the Association object for 
   GMPLS signaling [RFC3473] to associate diversely routed VCAT group 
   members.  It does not introduce any new signaling messages, nor 
   change the relationship between LSRs that are adjacent in the control 
   plane.  This association information in the event of an interception 
   may indicate that there are members of the same VCAT group that take 
   a different route and may indicate to an interceptor that the network 
   may be more robust. 

   Otherwise, this document does not introduce any additional security 
   considerations.
