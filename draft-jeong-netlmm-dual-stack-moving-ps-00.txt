Internet-Draft          Dual Stack Moving Problem            August 2006


Abstract

   This draft discusses the handover problem of dual stack mobile nodes
   when the mobile nodes roam over IPv4 and IPv6 NETLMM domains.
   Current NETLMM architecture supports IPv6 only.  However, as the
   NETLMM architecture being more widely used, it will be likely to
   introduce the NETLMM architecture to IPv4 networks.  In this
   environment, a dual stack mobile node may move to both IPv6 and IPv4
   NETLMM domains.

Internet-Draft          Dual Stack Moving Problem            August 2006


1.  Introduction

   The Internet is now evolving towards a commercial carrier-grade IP
   network with appropriate QoS and security.  Mobility management is
   one of the important factors in realizing such a mature IP network.
   Many proposals on IP mobility management for the Internet have
   considered the use of end-to-end principles.  However, it is well
   known that mobility for IP nodes can be more efficiently supported if
   mobility management is handled by network elements.

   The IETF NETLMM WG has launched standardization of network-based
   mobility management in a localized domain.  According to
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-nohost-ps], problems of the existing host-based
   solutions for localized mobility management are summarized as follow:
   1) change of host stack software, 2) lack of supporting both IPv4 and
   IPv6, and 3) additional security associations between network nodes
   and mobile nodes.  Network-based localized mobility management could
   be one of the prominent ways to support IP mobility to mobile nodes,
   because it requires no software on the mobile node.

   In [I-D.ietf-netlmm-nohost-req], 12 goals for localized mobility
   management are described.  Among them, following goal is not achieved
   yet.

   o  Support for IPv4 and IPv6 (Goal #9)

   During the transition period from IPv4 to IPv6, it will be likely to
   exist heterogeneous localized domains supporting different IP stacks.
   That is, it is expected that some localized domains deploy IPv4-only,
   while other domains supports IPv6-only.  In this environment, a dual
   stack mobile node may move to both IPv6 NETLMM domains and IPv4
   NETLMM domains.  Therefore, a new mobility management protocol is
   required to maintain IP connectivity during a dual stack mobile
   node's handover between IPv6 NETLMM domains and IPv4 NETLMM domains.

2.  Terminology

   Terminology in this document follows that in [RFC3753] and
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-nohost-ps], with the addition of some new and
   revised terminology given here:

   o  Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) : A node in the network which manages
      a mapping between mobile node's permanent address and the local
      temporary address.

3.  Problem Statement

   Current network-based localized mobility management architecture
   proposed by NETLMM WG supports IPv6 only.  However, as the NETLMM
   architecture being more widely used, it will be likely to introduce
   the NETLMM architecture to IPv4 networks.

   In this environment, a dual stack mobile node may move to not only
   IPv6 NETLMM domains but also IPv4 NETLMM domains.  When the dual
   stack mobile node handovers between IPv6 NETLMM and IPv4 NETLMM
   domains, it will be difficult to maintain IP connectivity.
   Especially, maintaining IPv6 connectivity in IPv4 NETLMM domains or
   IPv4 connectivity in IPv6 NETLMM domains is not supported.
   Therefore, this suggests to design a mobility management solution for
   federated NETLMM domains.

   Current mobility management protocols (e.g., Mobile IP) may be
   applied to the mobility management between heterogeneous NETLMM
   domains.  However, the mobile host-side stack requirement would
   hinders the wide deployment of those mobility management protocols.
   Also, location privacy problem may occur when the mobile node moves
   to other NETLMM domains.  The change in temporary local address as
   the mobile node moves exposes the mobile node's topological location
   to correspondents and potentially to eavesdroppers
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-nohost-ps].

   Therefore, it is needed to develop a mobility management protocol
   that supports mobile node's roaming over IPv6 and IPv4 NETLMM domains
   with single IP address and does not require additional host-side
   software update.

3.1.  Handover Scenario for Dual Stack Mobile Nodes

   The mobile node's movement scenario for federated NETLMM domains is
   shown in Fig. 1.  In the following handover scenario, we assume that
   both the mobile nodes and the MAPs are IPv4 and IPv6-capable and that
   the proposed protocol solution of NETLMM WG is used within a NETLMM
   domain.  We also assume that the MAPs are always reachable through a
   globally unique IPv4 or IPv6 address.

   In the handover scenario, the dual stack mobile node moves between an
   IPv6-only NETLMM domain and IPv4-only NETLMM domain.

                                 versions

   In the scenario, the mobile node moves between the IPv6-only NETLMM
   domain and IPv4-only NETLMM domain, but the mobile node might be
   communicating with an IPv4-only application as well as an IPv6
   application.  Thus, we consider the following two cases of
   applications for CN.

   o  case 1 : CN (Use of IPv4-only applications)

   o  case 2 : CN (Use of IPv6 applications)

5.  Security Considerations

   Although NETLMM protocol solution supports mobility without any extra
   signaling between a mobile node and network, it still requires
   mobility signaling for the handover between NETLMM domains.  Thus, it
   is required to have extra security association between a MAP and a
   mobile node when handover between NETLMM domains occurs.  Also,
   removing mobile node's involvement in mobility management limits the
   possibility of DoS attacks on network infrastructural elements
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-nohost-req].  IPSec can be applied to guarantee the
   signaling messages exchanged by network entities.
