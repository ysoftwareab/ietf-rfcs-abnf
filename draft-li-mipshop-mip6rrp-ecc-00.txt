Internet-Draft      ECC Return Routability Procedure       February 2007


Abstract

   Mobile IPv6 Return Routability Procedure (RRP) is used to secure the
   Binding Updates between a Mobile Node and a Correspondent Node where
   there is no pre-established security relationship between the two
   parties.  This document puts forward a mechanism called ECC RRP,
   which enhances the key management for Return Routability Procedure
   with anonymous Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Key Agreement
   Protocol.  The proposed procedure is not prone to attacks by nodes on
   the route from correspondent node to home agent in way that the RRP
   process described in RFC3775 is.  It also reduces the latency related
   to handovers that require new binding updates.

Internet-Draft      ECC Return Routability Procedure       February 2007


1.  Introduction

   Mobile IPv6 document [RFC3775] specifies the Return Routability
   Procedure (RRP) for protection of the Binding Update and Binding
   Acknowledgement between Mobile Node (MN) and Correspondent Node (CN),
   even in scenarios where there is no pre-established security
   relationship between the MN and the CN.  The Return Routability
   Procedure provides a good level of security in certain circumstances;
   however, this procedure cannot defend against the attacker that can
   eavesdrop on the two messages of HoT and CoT simultaneously.
   Especially, when the attacker eavesdrops on the HoT message, he also
   can easily calculate the Binding Management Key and personate the MN
   to launch the Binding Update cancellation that leads to the return-
   to-home spoofing attacks.

   This specification introduces the improvement to RRP using Elliptic
   Curve Key agreement protocol.  The improvement reduces the
   vulnerabilities to the attacks mentioned above, while it manages to
   preserve the performance advantages of RRP.  The key agreement
   protocol based on Elliptic Curve can provide good security with
   relatively small key size, thus it is suitable for mobile ip
   application in mobile wireless environments.  This key agreement
   protocol enables the MN to securely establish shared key with CN
   without requiring the two involved parties to have any pre-
   established relationship.

   The document [RFC4449] specifies a static shared key mechanism to
   protect the Route Optimization.  This mechanism requires the
   configuration of a shared secret between Mobile Node and its
   Correspondent Node.  The applicability of this mechanism is limited
   due to the need for pre-configuration.  This mechanism is also
   limited to use only in scenarios where mobile nodes can be trusted
   not to misbehave, as the validity of the claimed care-of addresses is
   not verified.

   The mechanism introduced in this document can be seen as using the
   dynamic shared key that is generated by key agreement protocol to
   protect the Route Optimization without pre-configuration.  The ECC
   RRP, although benefitting from the strength of public key
   cryptography, can be deployed in an infrastructure-less manner and
   without adding to signaling latency or roundtrips; the public keys
   and domain parameters are simply carried through new mobility
   options, included in the existing RRP messaging.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   RRP: Return Routability Procedure, The Return Routability procedure
   is a procedure defined in RFC 3775.  It is performed prior to the
   Route Optimization, where a mobile node instructs a correspondent
   node to direct the mobile node's data traffic to its claimed care-of
   address.  The Return Routability procedure provides some security
   assurance and prevents the misuse of Mobile IPv6 signaling to
   maliciously redirect the traffic or to launch other attacks.

   Other Mobile IPv6 terminologies are copied from RFC3775.

3.  Design goals and Principles

   The design philosophy is that the protection mechanisms of Routing
   Optimization should deal with the security threats as discussed in
   [RFC4225], without introducing new significant security problems to
   the operation of Mobile IPv6.  For instance, the design ought to
   avoid the reflection and amplification attacks and be resilient to
   resource exhaustion DoS attacks.

   The Return Routability Procedure provides less than strong
   authentication between IPv6 Mobile Nodes and Correspondent Nodes in
   the global Internet.  It is necessary to accept less than perfect
   security in this situation, because strong authentication between
   previously unknown peers would require a pre-shared key
   configurations of massive scales or a global Public Key
   Infrastructure (PKI), neither of which is desirable today.

   The proposed mechanism also conforms to the infrastructureless
   features of RRP and builds upon the idea of checking that a MN is
   indeed reachable through both its home address and its care-of
   address.  To avoid additional latency, ECC RRP uses the same two
   basic message exchanges as those in return routability procedure
   (RRP) [RFC3775], but is stronger or at least as secure as RRP in
   terms of dealing with the security threats described in RFC4225.  In
   order to make sure the same level of resiliency to reflection and
   amplification attacks, care is taken so that the CN responds to
   messages from MN with packets of approximately the same size.  It
   should still be noted that the solution still relies on the
   assumption of an uncorrupted routing infrastructure.

   Compared with RRP proposed by RFC3775,this new mechanism provides a
   good security,low handoff latency and high robustness.

   This mechanism uses the following principles depicted in [RFC3775]:

   - Verification of HoA and CoA: i.e., the mobile node is reachable
   through both its Home address and its care-of address.

   - The eventual Binding Update is cryptographically bound to the
   tokens and key supplied in the exchanged messages.

   - Symmetric exchanges are employed to to extent possible to avoid the
   use of this protocol in reflection attacks.

   - The correspondent node operates in a stateless manner until it
   receives a fully authorized Binding Update for avoiding state
   exhaustion DoS attacks.

   - Some additional protection is provided by encrypting the tunnels
   between the mobile node and home agent with IPSec ESP.

   - Cookies check for alleviate the DOS attack.

   Further information about the design fundamentals of the mechanism
   used have been adopted from these documents [RFC3775, RFC4225].

4.  Binding Updates to Correspondent Nodes

   MN and CN establish shared master secret by Elliptic Curve Diffie-
   Hellman key agreement protocol, and the Binding Management Key is
   derived from the shared master secret.  The key agreement protocol
   data are carried in the RRP and BU messages.  In the first
   correspondent registration, the CN and MN perform the full RRP that
   contains HoTI/HoT and CoTI/CoT, however, the subsequent RRP (for
   subsequent binding updates, e.g. as a result of a handover) just
   launch the CoTI/CoT.  And the generation of new Binding Management
   Key partly relies on the last Kbm.

4.1.  Establishing shared secret between CN and MN

   Elliptic Curve Cryptography [ECC] is emerging as an excellent public-
   key cryptosystem that provides security equivalent to currently
   popular public-key mechanisms based on IFP (Integer Factorization
   Problem) or DLP (Discrete Logarithm Problem) such as RSA and DSA with
   smaller key sizes.  Smaller key sizes result in savings for power,
   memory, bandwidth, and computational cost that make ECC especially
   attractive for mobile environments.  Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
   (ECDH) is a key agreement protocol that allows two parties to
   establish a shared secret key over an unsecured channel.  The
   protocol is secure because no secrecy is disclosed (except for the
   public keys, which are not secret), and no party can deduce the
   private key of the other unless it can solve the Elliptic Curve
   Discrete Logarithm Problem.  The simplest sort of Elliptic Curve used
   in cryptography is defined by an equation of the form:

   y^2 = x^3 + ax + b.

   The first stage of the ECDH key agreement protocol is the exchange of
   elliptic curve cryptosystem domain parameters [ECCDP].  Generally,
   the CN generates the domain parameters and pre-computed its key pair.
   At the first step, MN sends the CoTI message to query the domain
   parameters (p,a,b,G,n,h) prepared by CN, and sends the HoTI message
   to get CN's public key.  Once CN receives the CoTI message, it will
   send the CoT message which carries the domain parameters; on
   receiving the HoTI message, CN sends the HoT messages that carries
   its public key.  Once the MN receives the CoT message from CN, MN
   selects a random number/integer as private key according to the
   domain parameters and calculates the public key.  MN sends the BU
   messages carried its public key to CN.  Using its own key pair and
   the other's public key both the MN and the CN derive the same shared
   secret.  MN and CN have a key pair of elliptic curve cryptography,
   consisting of a private key SK(a randomly selected integer in the
   interval [1,n-1]) and a public key PK(where PK = SK*G).Let CN's key
   pair be (SKc,PKc) and MN's key pair be (SKm,PKm).After receiving the

Internet-Draft      ECC Return Routability Procedure       February 2007


   BU message from MN, CN and MN have the other party's public key.  MN
   computes (Kx,Ky) = SKm*PKc, CN computes SKc*PKm.  The shared secret
   is Kx(the x coordinate of the point).  The number calculated by both
   parties is equal, because

   SKm*PKc = SKm*(SKc*G) = SKc*(SKm*G) = SKc*PKm.

   The Home and Care-of Test Init messages are sent simultaneously.A
   mobile node sends a Home Test Init message to the correspondent node
   (via the home agent) to acquire the CN's public key.

4.3.1.  The first Correspondent registration

   In the first correspondent registration, the Return Routability test
   messages need to carry the key agreement protocol data.

   Home Test (from the Correspondent Node):

   Upon receiving HoTI message forwarded by the Home Agent of mobile
   node, the CN replies in the following form:

   * Source address = correspondent node address

   * Destination address = home address

   * Parameters:

   + home init cookie

   + home keygen token

   + home nonce index

   + CN's public key

   In fact, the home keygen token and home nonce index are not used and
   set to be null.

   Care-of Test:

   This message is sent in response to a Care-of Test Init message. it
   is sent directly to the mobile node.  The contents of the message
   are:

   * Source address = correspondent node address

   * Destination address = care-of address

   * Parameters:

   + care-of init cookie

   + care-of keygen token

   + care-of nonce index

   + EC domain parameters

   When the mobile node has received both the Home and Care-of Test
   messages, the return routability procedure is complete.  As a result
   of the procedure, the mobile node has the data it needs to send a
   Binding Update to the correspondent node.Firstly,the mobile node uses
   the private key of its own and the CN's public key to compute the
   shared secret.  If the size of shared secret is 160 bits, using
   shared secret as the master secret, otherwise hashing the shared
   secret by SHA1 as the master secret.  CN and MN calculate the binding
   management key (Kbm) as follows:

   Kbm = HMAC_SHA-1(master secret, care-of keygen token |CN address |
   CoA | HoA).

   Authorizing Binding Management messages:

Internet-Draft      ECC Return Routability Procedure       February 2007


   After the mobile node has created the binding management key (Kbm),
   which can supply a verifiable Binding Update to the correspondent
   node.  Binding update To authorize a Binding Update, the mobile node
   creates a binding management key (Kbm) as described in the previous
   section.  The contents of the Binding Update include the following:

   * Source address = care-of address

   * Destination address = correspondent node address

   * Parameters:

   + Home address(within the Home Address destination option)

   + Sequence number (within the Binding update message header)

   + home nonce index (not used)

   + care-of nonce index (within the nonce indices option)

   + MN's public key (within the public key option)

   + First (96, HMAC_SHA1 (Kbm, care-of address | correspondent |BU))

   The Binding Update contains MN's public key that is used to generate
   the shared secret with CN.  The Binding Update also contains a Nonce
   Indices option, indicating to the correspondent node which care-of
   nonces to use to recompute the binding management key.  Note that the
   correspondent node does not create any state specific to the mobile
   node, until it receives the first Binding Update from that mobile
   node.  Once the correspondent node has verified the MAC, it can
   create a Binding Cache entry for the mobile and maintain the value
   for the binding management key that can be indexed by HoA in the
   cache.

4.3.2.  Subsequent Correspondent registration

   Once the MN's CoA is altered or receiving the Binding refresh request
   from the correspondent code, the MN needn't perform the Full RR Test,
   it merely sends Care-of Test init message to the correspondent.  On
   receiving the HoTI message, correspondent node responds CoT message.
   Using the following method to calculate the Kbm:

   Kbm = HMAC_SHA-1(prev_Kbm, care-of keygen token| CoA | CN Address |
   HoA).

   A Binding Update may also be used to delete a previously established
   binding.  In this case, the binding management key is generated as

   follows:

   Kbm = HMAC_SHA-1(prev_Kbm, CN Address | HoA).

   The contents of Binding Update message are same as the BU message
   described in [RFC3775] and need not include the MN's public key
   option.

5.  Security Considerations

   The first consideration is that, the proposed solution relies on the
   assumption of an uncorrupted routing infrastructure and builds upon
   the idea of checking that an alleged mobile node is indeed reachable
   through both its home address and its care-of address.

   [RFC3552] classifies attacks into two main categories: passive
   attacks and active attacks.  Passive attacks are ones where an
   attacker simply reads information off the network and obtains
   confidential and/or private information which can be used to
   compromise network systems.  Active attacks are ones where the
   attacker writes data to the network and can include replay
   attacks,message insertion, message deletion, message modification and
   man-in-the-middle attacks.  Often, passive and active attacks are
   combined.  Generally, if an attacker wants to launch active
   attacks,it collects the information of target by passive attacks
   firstly.  Once an attacker has gained sufficient information from the
   passive attack, it can initiate active attacks against the target.
   Passive attacks on wireless networks are extremely common.  Passive
   attacks are by their nature very difficult to detect, so it is
   necessary to secure Mobile IPv6 route optimization against passive
   attack.  The RRP integrated with anonymous key agreement protocols,
   i.e. improved RRP can defend against the passive attacks of
   eavesdropping the CoT/HoT messages.  However, without authentication,
   key agreement protocol may be vulnerable to MITM attack.

5.1.  MITM attack

   This improved RRP can protect against the eavesdropping attacks but
   not defend against certain man-in-the-middle attacks, when the
   attacker resides along the routing path between the correspondent
   node and the mobile node's home agent.  However, it should be noted
   that such attackers are capable of performing the similar attacks
   even without Mobile IPv6.  Thus this proposal does not introduce any
   new threats in that sense.

   For instance, when launching MITM attack, an attacker would not only
   need to observe the packets passing by but would instead need to
   inject modified packets in both directions.  Owing to the property of
   IP, an attacker in the middle between MN and CN tries to fool both
   entities as above described, but it can not prevent the original
   packet from CN, the MN will receive two different public key values
   for the CN, and thus be aware that a malicious node is trying to lead
   some attacks.  So the MN can send warning message to the CN or take
   other measures.  MN also has ways to detect the attacks.  In order
   not to be readily detected the attacks by the CN and MN, the attacker
   also is able to prevent the original packets intercepted are not

   delivered, which requires the attacker has a strong capabilities of
   control the network traffic.

   So if attacker wants to launch the MITM attack without being
   detected, it can control the communication channel between the both
   sides.  In fact, if an attacker can perform the MITM attack between
   MN and CN, well then it also can launch attacks that not by the
   forged Binding Update messages.  Without authentication mechanism,
   the node at its home link still can not avoid this kind of attack.

5.2.  Denial of service attack (DOS) attack

   Creating state safely and Limitation the rate of Mobility Header
   message make the improved RRP have well immunity to DOS attacks.  The
   improved return routability procedure also has protection against
   resource exhaustion Denial-of-Service attacks.  The correspondent
   nodes do not retain any state about individual mobile nodes until an
   authentic Binding Update arrives.  This is achieved through the
   construct of keygen tokens from the nonces and node keys that are not
   specific to individual mobile nodes.  The keygen tokens can be
   reconstructed by the correspondent node, based on the care-of address
   information that arrives with the Binding Update.  This means that
   the correspondent nodes are safe against memory exhaustion attacks.
   Due to the use of same public/private key pair with all MNs,
   correspondent node does not compute the master secret until receiving
   the binding update message, so the correspondent nodes are relatively
   safe against CPU resource exhaustion attacks as well.  The mobile
   node MUST NOT send Mobility Header messages of a particular type to a
   particular correspondent node more than MAX_UPDATE_RATE(=3) times
   within a second.  These limitation the rate of sending/receiving
   Mobility Header messages also prevents or mitigates denial of service
   attacks.

   A correspondent node can protect itself against some of these
   resource exhaustion attacks as follows.  If the correspondent node is
   flooded with a large number of Binding Updates that fail the
   cryptographic integrity checks, it can stop processing Binding
   Updates.  If a correspondent node finds that it is spending more
   resources on checking bogus Binding Updates than it is likely to save
   by accepting genuine Binding Updates, then it may silently discard
   some or all Binding Updates without performing any cryptographic
   operations.

5.3.  Replay attacks

   The generation of Kbm is protected by the Care-of Nonce and can
   defend against replay attack.The improved return routability
   procedure also protects the participants against replayed Binding

   Updates.  The attacker is unable replay the same message due to the
   sequence number which is a part of the Binding Update.  It is also
   unable to modify the Binding Update since the MAC verification would
   fail after such a modification
