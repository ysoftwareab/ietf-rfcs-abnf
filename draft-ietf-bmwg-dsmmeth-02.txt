Abstract       
  This document describes the methodology for the benchmarking of 
  devices that implement traffic control based on classification such 
  as diff-serv code point (DSCP) criteria.  The methodology is to be 
  applied to measurements made on the data plane to evaluate the 
  performance of the traffic control mechanisms.  The methodology 
  permits the specific traffic control mechanisms and configuration 
  commands to vary between DUTs.  The methodology provides procedures 
  using existing Terminology to benchmark DUT performance traffic 
  control mechanisms applied to physical and logical interfaces using 
  DSCP as the classification criteria. This includes scenarios where 
  Forwarding Congestion occurs due to interface congestion.

1. Introduction 

   This document describes the methodology for the benchmarking of 
   devices that implement traffic control based on diff-serv code 
   point (DSCP) criteria.  The methodology is to be applied to 
   measurements made on the data plane to evaluate the performance 
   of the traffic control mechanisms.  The methodology permits the 
   specific traffic control mechanisms and configuration commands to 
   vary between Devices Under Test (DUTs).  This methodology provides 
   procedures using existing Terminology to benchmark DUT performance 
   for traffic control mechanisms using DSCP as the classification 
   criteria.  This includes scenarios where Forwarding Congestion 
   occurs at physical or logical interfaces either due to Forwarding 
   Capacity of the interface or DUT configuration of traffic control 
   mechanisms, such as rate limiting. The methodology uses much of the 
   terminology defined in [Pp06]. 
      
2.  Existing definitions       
      
   For the sake of clarity and continuity this RFC adopts the 
   template for definitions set out in Section 2 of RFC 1242.  
   Definitions are indexed and grouped together in sections for ease 
   of reference.  Reference [Pp06] for benchmarking terminology.
      
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [Br97].  RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make the
   intent of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this
   document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards track
   document.

3. Test Setup	
     3.1 Test Topologies

     Figure 1 shows the logical Test Topology for benchmarking 
     performance when Forwarding Congestion does not exist on the 
     physical or logical egress interface.  This topology is to be 
     used when benchmarking the Undifferentiated Response and the 
     Traffic Control without Forwarding Congestion.  Figure 2 shows 
     the logical Test Topology for benchmarking performance when 
     Forwarding Congestion does exist on the physical or logical 
     egress interface.  This topology is to be used when 
     benchmarking the Traffic Control with Forwarding Congestion.  
     The Forwarding Congestion is produced by offering load to two 
     ingress interfaces on the DUT destined for the same single 
     egress interface.  The aggregate of the ingress offered load 
     MUST exceed the Forwarding Capacity of the egress interface 
     to produce Forwarding Congestion.

   3.2 Test Considerations

   3.2.1 Routing Configuration
   Routing Protocols SHOULD NOT be used.  All routing decisions
   SHOULD be made based upon pre-configured static routes.        

   3.2.2 Interface Types
   All test cases in this methodology document may be executed with
   any interface type.  All interfaces MUST be the same media and 
   Throughput [5,6] for each test case.  

   3.2.3 Offered Vector

   The Offered Vector MUST be configured on the Tester as follows:

   a. The Offered Load MUST be the Forwarding Capacity of the 
      device at a fixed packet size.  

   b. The Forwarding Capacity MUST be measured at the egress 
      interface of the DUT

   c. Each test case MUST be executed using a single, selectable
      packet size.  Packet Size is measured in bytes and includes 
      the IP header and payload.  If IPsec packets are used then
      the packet size also includes it.  Packet Size MUST be 
      equal to or less than the interface MTU so that there is no
      fragmentation.  

   d. It is RECOMMENDED that the number of flows used be 
      1000, 10000, and/or 100000.  A flow MUST be identified
      by its DSCP, IP Source Address, and IP Destination Address.

   e. It is RECOMMENDED that the number of DSCPs used be
      1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 16, and/or 64.  When the number of DSCPs
      is 1 then the Undifferentiated Response is benchmarked.  
      The actual values of the DSCPs used is selectable.  

   3.2.4 Test Duration
   It is RECOMMENDED that the Test Duration for each test case
   includes a minimum of 10 minutes of Offered Load and 
   Output Vector measurement

   3.2.5 Expected Vector
   The Expected Vector is configured on the DUT.  The Traffic 
   Control mechanisms and specific configuration commands may 
   vary between DUTs.  Test Cases may be repeated with 
   variation to the Expected Vector to produce a more 
   benchmark results.

     For each test case, it is recommended that the following 
     reporting format be completed:

     Procedure:     
     1. Configure the egress physical interface so that it 
        has multiple logical interfaces.  The number 
        of interfaces MUST be recorded.
     2. Configure DUT with Expected Vectors on each logical 
        interface so that the Expected Forwarding Vector for 
        each DSCP in the Codepoint Set < Forwarding Capacity 
        of the logical interface .    
     3. Configure the Tester for the Offered Vector.          
        Number of DSCPs MUST be 2 or more. 
        Any DSCP values can be used and MUST be recorded.  
        Use 1000 Flows identified by IP SA/DA and DSCP value.     
     4. Using the Test Topology in Figure 1, source the         
        Offered Load from the Tester to the DUT.     
     5. Measure and record the Output Vector for each DSCP        
        in the Codepoint Set.      
     6. Maintain offered load for 10 minutes minimum to 
        observe possible variations in measurements.     
     7. Repeat steps 2 through 5 with 10000 and 100000 Flows.     
     8. Increment number of DSCPs used and repeat steps         
        1 through 6.      
  
     Expected Results:     
     Output Vectors equal the Expected Vectors.  There is       
     no packet loss and no out-of-order packets.  Output      
     Vectors match the Expected Vectors for each DSCP in
     the Codepoint Set for each logical interface.                                             

  4.6 Traffic Control Mechanisms on Logical Interfaces with
      Forwarding Congestion     

     Purpose:       
     To benchmark the Output Vectors for a Codepoint Set     
     at Logical Interfaces of a single physical link for each 
     DSCP when there is Forwarding Congestion.      

     Procedure:     
     1. Configure the egress physical interface so that it 
        has multiple logical interfaces.  The number 
        of interfaces MUST be recorded.
     2. Configure DUT with Expected Vectors on each logical 
        interface so that Expected Forwarding Vector for each 
        DSCP in the Codepoint Set < Forwarding Capacity of 
        the logical interface .

     3. Configure the Tester for the Offered Vector.          
        Number of DSCPs MUST be 2 or more. 
        Any DSCP values can be used.  
        Use 1000 Flows identified by IP SA/DA and DSCP value.  
        The Offered Load MUST exceed the Forwarding caoacity 
        of the Logical Interface by 25%.     
     4. Using the Test Topology in Figure 2, source the         
        Offered Load from the Tester to the DUT.  The ingress 
        offered load MUST exceed the reduced interface 
        bandwidth of each egress logical interface to produce 
        Forwarding Congestion.     
     5. Measure and record the Output Vector for each DSCP        
        in the Codepoint Set.      
     6. Maintain offered load for 10 minutes minimum to 
        observe possible variations in measurements.     
     7. Repeat steps 2 through 5 with 10000 and 100000 Flows.     
     8. Increment offered load by 25% to 200% maximum.     
     9. Increment number of DSCPs used and repeat steps 1 
        through 6.      

     Expected Results:     
     Forwarding Vector equals the Expected Vector.        
     There is packet loss due to drops from congestion and 
     There are no out-of-order packets.  Output vectors match 
     the Expected Vectors for each DSCP in the Codepoint Set.

5. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA considerations.


6. Security Considerations 
           
   Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of 
   the Internet or of corporate networks as long as benchmarking 
   is not performed on devices or systems connected to 
   production networks. 
           
   Packets with unintended and/or unauthorized DSCP or IP 
   precedence values may present security issues.  Determining 
   the security consequences of such packets is out of scope for 
   this document.
