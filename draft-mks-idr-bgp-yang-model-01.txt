   This document describes a YANG data model for the BGP [RFC4271]
   protocol, including various protocol extensions, policy
   configuration, as well as defining key operational state data.  The
   model is intended to be vendor-neutral, in order to allow operators
   to manage BGP configuration in heterogeneous environments with
   routers supplied by multiple vendors.  The model is also intended to
   be readily mapped to existing implementations to facilitate support
   from as large a set of routing hardware and software vendors as
   possible.

1.1.  Goals and approach

   The model covers the base BGP features that are deployed across major
   implementations and the common BGP configurations in use across a
   number of operator network deployments.  In particular, this model
   attempts to cover BGP features defined in [RFC4271], [RFC1997],
   [RFC4456], [RFC4760], [RFC3065], [RFC2439], [RFC4724], and [RFC6811].

   Along with configuration of base BGP features, this model also
   addresses policy configuration, by providing "hooks" for applying
   policies, and also defining BGP-specific policy features.  The BGP
   policy features are intended to be used with the general routing
   policy model defined in [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model].  The model
   also supports operational state data to provide a common model for
   reading BGP-related state from a BGP speaker.

Internet-Draft               BGP YANG Model                November 2017


   For the base BGP features, the focus of the model described in this
   document is on providing configuration and operational state
   information relating to:

   o  The global BGP instance, and neighbors whose configuration is
      specified individually, or templated with the use of peer-groups.

   o  The address families that are supported by peers, and the global
      configuration which relates to them.

   o  The policy configuration "hooks" and BGP-specific policy features
      that relate to a neighbor - controlling the import and export of
      NLRIs.

   As mentioned earlier, any configuration items that are deemed to be
   widely available in existing major BGP implementations are included
   in the model.  Additional, more esoteric, configuration items that
   are not commonly used, or only available from a single
   implementation, are omitted from the model with an expectation that
   they will be available in companion modules that augment or extend
   the current model.  This allows clarity in identifying data that is
   part of the vendor-neutral base model.

   Where possible, naming in the model follows conventions used in
   available standards documents, and otherwise tries to be self-
   explanatory with sufficient descriptions of the intended behavior.
   Similarly, configuration data value constraints and default values,
   where used, are based on recommendations in current standards
   documentation, or those commonly used in multiple implementations.
   Since implementations can vary widely in this respect, this version
   of the model specifies only a limited set of defaults and ranges with
   the expectation of being more prescriptive in future versions based
   on actual operator use.

2.  Model overview

   The BGP model is defined across several YANG modules and submodules,
   but at a high level is organized into six elements:

   o  base protocol configuration -- configuration affecting BGP
      protocol-related operations, defined at various levels of
      hierarchy.

   o  multiprotocol configuration -- configuration affecting individual
      address-families within BGP [RFC4760].

   o  neighbor configuration -- configuration affecting an individual
      neighbor within BGP.

Internet-Draft               BGP YANG Model                November 2017


   o  neighbor multiprotocol configuration -- configuration affecting
      individual address-families for a neighbor within BGP.

   o  policy configuration -- hooks for application of the policies
      defined in [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model] that act on routes sent
      (received) to (from) peers or other routing protocols and BGP-
      specific policy features.

   o  operational state -- variables used for monitoring and management
      of BGP operations.

   These modules also make use of standard Internet types, such as IP
   addresses and prefixes, autonomous system numbers, etc., defined in
   RFC 6991 [RFC6991].

   Throughout the model, the approach described in NMDA
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores] is used to represent running
   configuration, intended and operational datastore.  That is to say,
   that the model defines a single container, and it is the
   implementation of the different datastores that reflects the value of
   a given node in either the <running>, <intended> or <operational>
   datastore.

2.1.  BGP protocol configuration

   The BGP protocol configuration model is organized hierarchically,
   much like the majority of router implementations.  That is,
   configuration items can be specified at multiple levels, as shown
   below.

                 +--rw bgp!
                    +--rw global
                    |  +-- (global-configuration-options)
                    +--rw neighbors
                    |  +--rw neighbor* [neighbor-address]
                    |  +-- (neighbor-configuration-options)
                    +--rw peer-groups
                       +--rw peer-group* [peer-group-name]
                       +-- (neighbor-configuration-options)

   Users may specify configuration at a higher level and have it apply
   to all lower-level items, or provide overriding configuration at a
   lower level of the hierarchy.  Overriding configuration items are
   optional, with neighbor specific configuration being the most
   specific or lowest level, followed by peer-group, and finally global.
   Global configuration options reflect a subset of the peer-group or
   neighbor specific configuration options which are relevant to the
   entire BGP instance.

Internet-Draft               BGP YANG Model                November 2017


   The model makes the simplifying assumption that most of the
   configuration items are available at all levels of the hierarchy.
   That is, very little configuration is specific to a particular level
   in the hierarchy, other than obvious items such as "group-name" only
   being available for the peer group-level config.  A notable exception
   is for sub-address family configuration where some items are only
   applicable for a given AFI-SAFI combination.

   In order to allow common configuration to be applied to a set of
   neighbors, all neighbor configuration options are available within a
   peer-group.  A neighbor is associated to a particular peer-group
   through the use of a peer-group leaf (which provides a reference to a
   configured item in the peer-group list).

   Address-family configuration is made available in multiple points
   within the model - primarily within the global container, where
   instance-wide configuration can be set (for example, global protocol
   parameters, the BGP best path route selection options, or global
   policies relating to the address-family); and on a per-neighbor or
   per-peer-group basis, where address-families can be enabled or
   disabled, and policy associated with the parent entity applied.
   Within the afi-safi container, generic configuration that applies to
   all address-families (e.g., whether the AFI-SAFI is enabled) is
   presented at the top-level, with address-family specific containers
   made available for options relating to only that AFI-SAFI.  Within
   the current revision of the model a generic set of address-families,
   and common configuration and state options are included - further
   work is expected to add additional parameters to this area of the
   model.

   The following address-families are currently supported by the model:

                      |     ...

2.2.  Policy configuration overview

   The BGP policy configuration model references the generic YANG
   routing policy model described in [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model],
   which represents a condition-action policy framework for routing.
   This model adds BGP-specific conditions (e.g., matching on the
   community attribute), and actions (e.g., setting local preference) to
   the generic policy framework.

   Policies that are defined in the routing-policy model are referenced
   in multiple places within the model:

   o  within the global instance, where a policy applies to all address-
      families for all peers.

   o  on a global AFI-SAFI basis, where policies apply to all peers for
      a particular address-family.

   o  on a per-peer-group or per-neighbor basis - where the policy
      applies to all address-families for the particular group or
      neighbor.

   o  on a per-afi-safi basis within a neighbor or peer-group context,
      where the policy is specific to the AFI-SAFI for a a specific
      neighbor or group.

                       +--rw apply-policy

2.3.  Operational state overview

   The BGP operational model contains data which relates to the
   operational state of the various elements of the BGP router.  As
   noted in Section 2 - the approach described in NMDA
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores] is utilized for the modeling of
   operational and statistical data.  To this end, the "-state"
   groupings (those that contain derived operational parameters) is not
   a separate container, but is instead collapsed into one container
   that defines both the read-write and read-only nodes.  In some cases,
   operational information may be relevant to one instance of a common
   grouping, but not another - for example, the number of received,
   advertised, and installed prefixes is relevant on a per-neighbor-
   basis, but is not required (or meaningful) in the peer-group context.
   Groupings are defined with the appropriate operational state data
   accordingly.

3.  Relation to other YANG data models

   The BGP model is intended to work within a larger framework model,
   such as the Network Instance model [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ni-model] which
   provides a comprehensive model for defining VRFs, associated routing
   protocols, multiple protocol instances, and inter-protocol and inter-
   instance routing policies.  The current version of the model imports

   and instantiates the BGP model in its tree at /network-instances/
   network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/...

   It is also possible to integrate the BGP model with the Routing
   Management model [I-D.ietf-netmod-routing-cfg] or the Network Device
   Organizational Model [I-D.rtgyangdt-rtgwg-device-model], both of
   which define the notion of routing instances, or VRFs.

4.  Security Considerations

   BGP configuration has a significant impact on network operations, and
   as such any related protocol or model carries potential security
   risks.

   YANG data models are generally designed to be used with the NETCONF
   protocol over an SSH transport.  This provides an authenticated and
   secure channel over which to transfer BGP configuration and
   operational data.  Note that use of alternate transport or data
   encoding (e.g., JSON over HTTPS) would require similar mechanisms for
   authenticating and securing access to configuration data.

   Most of the data elements in the configuration model could be
   considered sensitive from a security standpoint.  Unauthorized access
   or invalid data could cause major disruption.

5.  IANA Considerations

   An appropriate namespace URI will be registered in the IETF XML
   Registry" [RFC3688].  The BGP YANG modules will be registered in the
   "YANG Module Names" registry [RFC6020].

6.  YANG modules

   The modules comprising the BGP configuration and operational model
   are described by the YANG modules and submodules in the sections
   below.

   The main module, ietf-bgp.yang, includes the following submodules:

   o  ietf-bgp-common - defines the groupings that are common across
      more than one context (where contexts are neighbor, group, global)

   o  ietf-bgp-common-multiprotocol - defines the groupings that are
      common across more than one context, and relate to multiprotocol
      BGP

   o  ietf-bgp-common-structure - defines groupings that are shared by
      multiple contexts, but are used only to create structural

      elements, i.e., containers (leaf nodes are defined in separate
      groupings)

   o  ietf-bgp-global - groupings with data specific to the global
      context

   o  ietf-bgp-peer-group - groupings with data specific to the peer
      group context

   o  ietf-bgp-neighbor - groupings with data specific to the neighbor
      context

   Additional modules include:

   o  ietf-bgp-types - common type and identity definitions for BGP,
      including BGP policy

   o  ietf-bgp-policy - BGP-specific policy data definitions for use
      with [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model] (described in more detail
      Section 2.2)

       "This module describes a YANG model for BGP protocol
       configuration. It is a limited subset of all of the configuration
       parameters available in the variety of vendor implementations,
       hence it is expected that it would be augmented with vendor-
       specific configuration data as needed. Additional modules or
       submodules to handle other aspects of BGP configuration,
       including policy, VRFs, VPNs, and additional address families
       are also expected.

       This model supports the following BGP configuration level
       hierarchy:

         BGP
           |
           +-> [ global BGP configuration ]
             +-> AFI / SAFI global
           +-> peer group
             +-> [ peer group config ]
             +-> AFI / SAFI [ per-AFI overrides ]
           +-> neighbor
             +-> [ neighbor config ]
             +-> [ optional pointer to peer-group ]

Appendix B.  Change summary

B.1.  Changes between revisions -01 and -02

   o  Refactored BGP model such that it is comprised of multiple sub-
      modules rather than independent modules.

   o  Remove the need for self-augmentation of the BGP model to allow
      the ability to import the model in wider structures more easily.

   o  Added new operational state values for BGP session established
      transitions and last-established timestamp.  Also deprecated
      uptime operational state leaf.

   o  Added ability to select eligible paths for add-paths based on a
      policy.

B.2.  Changes between revisions -00 and -01

   o  Updated module namespaces to reflect IETF standard namespace.

   o  Updated module filenames with ietf- prefix per RFC 6087
      guidelines.
