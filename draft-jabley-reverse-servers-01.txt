Internet-Draft        Nameservers for Reverse Zones        December 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in [RFC1034] and [RFC1035].
   The DNS currently supports keyed data retrieval using three
   namespaces -- domain names, IPv4 addresses and IPv6 addresses.
   Mapping of IPv4 addresses to names is accomplished using data
   published in the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone.  For IPv6, the IP6.ARPA zone is
   used (see [RFC3152]).  The process of mapping an address to a name is
   generally known as a "reverse lookup", and the IN-ADDR.ARPA and
   IP6.ARPA zones are said to support the "reverse DNS".

   The secure and stable hosting of the IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA zones
   is critical to the operation of the Internet, since many applications
   rely upon timely responses to reverse lookups to be able to operate
   normally.

   At the time of writing, the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone is served by a subset
   of the DNS root servers, and IP6.ARPA by servers operated by APNIC,
   ARIN, ICANN, LACNIC and the RIPE NCC (see Appendix A).

   This document specifies a dedicated and stable set of nameserver
   names for each of the IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA zones.

   The naming scheme specified in this document allows IN-ADDR.ARPA and
   IP6.ARPA be delegated to two different sets of nameservers, to
   facilitate operational separation of the infrastructure used to serve
   each zone.  This separation might help ensure that an operational
   failure of IN-ADDR.ARPA servers does not impact IPv6 reverse lookups
   as collateral damage, for example.

   The choice of operators for individual nameservers is beyond the
   scope of this document, and is an IANA function which falls under the
   scope of section 4 of the MoU between the IETF and ICANN [RFC2860].

2.  Nameservers for IN-ADDR.ARPA

   This document specifies the following naming scheme for servers which
   host the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone:

         A.IN-ADDR-SERVERS.ARPA
         B.IN-ADDR-SERVERS.ARPA
         C.IN-ADDR-SERVERS.ARPA
         D.IN-ADDR-SERVERS.ARPA
         E.IN-ADDR-SERVERS.ARPA
         F.IN-ADDR-SERVERS.ARPA
         ...

   The IN-ADDR-SERVERS.ARPA zone will be delegated to the same set of
   servers as IN-ADDR.ARPA.  IPv4 and IPv6 glue records for each of
   those servers will be added to the ARPA zone.

   The IN-ADDR-SERVERS.ARPA and IN-ADDR.ARPA zones are delegated to the
   same servers since they are both dedicated for a single purpose and
   hence can reasonably share fate.

   All servers in the set are named under the same domain to facilitate
   label compression.  Since glue for all servers will exist in the ARPA
   zone, the use of a single domain does not present a practical single
   point of failure.

3.  Nameservers for IP6.ARPA

   This document specifies the following nameserver set for the IP6.ARPA
   zone:

         A.IP6-SERVERS.ARPA
         B.IP6-SERVERS.ARPA
         C.IP6-SERVERS.ARPA
         D.IP6-SERVERS.ARPA
         E.IP6-SERVERS.ARPA
         F.IP6-SERVERS.ARPA
         ...

   The IP6-SERVERS.ARPA zone will be delegated to the same set of
   servers as IP6.ARPA.  IPv4 and IPv6 glue records for each of those
   servers will be added to the ARPA zone.

4.  IAB Statement

   In its capacity as the body that provides technical guidance to ICANN
   for the administration of the ARPA top-level domain as described in
   [RFC3172], the IAB has reviewed this proposal and supports it as an
   operational change that is in line with the respective roles of ICANN
   and the IAB.

5.  IANA Considerations

   With due consideration to the approval of the IAB (see Section 4) the
   IANA is directed to delegate:

   1.  IN-ADDR-SERVERS.ARPA to the nameservers listed in Section 2;

   2.  IP6-SERVERS.ARPA to the nameservers listed in Section 3.

   The IANA is further directed to install IPv4 and IPv6 glue records
   for the nameservers concerned in the ARPA zone.

   The choice of operators for all nameservers concerned is beyond the
   scope of this document, and is an IANA function which falls under the
   scope of section 4 of the MoU between the IETF and ICANN [RFC2860].

Appendix B.  Performance Characteristics

B.1.  Label Compression

   The choice of names for the respective NS RRSets of the IN-ADDR.ARPA
   and IP6.ARPA zones have a relatively minor impact on the delegation
   response sizes from their parent zones given other anticipated
   contributors such as DNSSEC.  However, it is still considered good
   practice to use a naming scheme which is reasonably compressible:
   doing so for frequently-queried zones such as these is likely to have
   at least measurable impact on aggregate DNS traffic in the Internet
   as a whole, and has potential transport benefits to clients whose
   queries will not result in secure replies.

   The naming schemes described in Section 2 and Section 3 are highly
   compressible.  That is, once a single nameserver name has been
   encoded in a DNS message, subsequent nameservers can be specified
   with substantially smaller encoding.

   In the DNS, a complete encoding of an a-label involves a one-byte
   length field, plus a one-byte-per-character encoding of the a-label
   itself.  A domain name's encoding consists of one or more a-labels,
   so-encoded, plus a single terminating zero byte.  Where a terminating
   series of a-labels has already been encoded as described above,
   subsequent terminating references to the same series can be made
   using a two-byte pointer to that full encoding.

   The non-compressed representation of the nameserver A.IN-ADDR-
   SERVERS.ARPA fills (1 + 1) + (15 + 1) + (4 + 1) + 1 = 24 bytes.

   The non-compressed representation of A.IP6-SERVERS.ARPA fills (1 + 1)
   + (10 + 1) + (4 + 1) + 1 = 19 bytes.

   Subsequent nameservers under either domain are encoded with the
   initial label, plus two bytes for a pointer to the repeated domain
   elsewhere in the message.  That is, (1 + 1) + 2 = 4 bytes.

   The encoded size of the a-labels in a twelve-record NS RRSet named
   according to Section 2 for IN-ADDR.ARPA is as follows:

B.2.  Query Patterns

   A brief description of likely query patterns for an empty cache with
   the existing and new NS RRSets follow.

B.2.1.  QNAME under IN-ADDR.ARPA

   Consider the IN-ADDR.ARPA NS RRSet described in Appendix A and a
   QNAME which is delegated beneath the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone:

   1.  Query sent to root server that is also authoritative for IN-
       ADDR.ARPA; response is a referral from the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone.

   In the case where the initial query is sent to the J root server:

   1.  Query sent to J.ROOT-SERVERS.NET (which is not authoritative for
       the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone); response is a referral to an ARPA server
       with additional-section glue.

   2.  Query sent to an ARPA server (all of which are also authoritative
       in this case for IN-ADDR.ARPA); response is a referral from the
       IN-ADDR.ARPA zone.

   Consider the same query with the IN-ADDR.ARPA NS RRSet described in
   Section 2:

   1.  Query sent to a root server which is also authoritative for ARPA;
       response is a referral to an IN-ADDR.ARPA server, with
       additional-section glue.

   2.  Query sent to an IN-ADDR.ARPA server; response is a referral from
       the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone.

   In the case where the first query is sent to the J root server:

   1.  Query sent to J.ROOT-SERVERS.NET (which is not authoritative for
       ARPA); response is a referral to an ARPA server, with additional-
       section glue.

   2.  Query sent to an ARPA server; response is a referral to an IN-
       ADDR.ARPA server, with additional-section glue.

   3.  Query sent to an IN-ADDR.ARPA server; response is a referral from
       the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone.

B.2.2.  QNAME under IP6.ARPA

   Consider the IP6.ARPA NS RRSet described in Appendix A and a QNAME
   which is delegated beneath the IP6.ARPA zone:

   1.  Query sent to root server that is also authoritative for ARPA;
       response is a referral from the ARPA zone to an IP6.ARPA server
       with no additional-section glue.

   2.  A recursive lookup for one of the nameservers specified in the
       referral must now be performed in order to obtain an address for
       an IP6.ARPA server.  In all cases three queries are required.
       Successive recursive lookups may be performed in the event that a

       server is unresponsive.

   3.  Query sent to IP6.ARPA server; response is a referral from the
       IP6.ARPA zone.

   In the case where the first query is sent to the J root server:

   1.  Query sent to J.ROOT-SERVERS.NET; response is a referral to an
       ARPA server with additional-section glue.

   2.  Query sent to an ARPA server; response is a referral from the
       ARPA zone to an IP6.ARPA server with no additional-section glue.

   3.  A recursive lookup for one of the nameservers specified in the
       referral must now be performed in order to obtain an address for
       an IP6.ARPA server.  In all cases three queries are required.
       Successive recursive lookups may be performed in the event that a
       server is unresponsive.

   4.  Query sent to IP6.ARPA server; response is a referral from the
       IP6.ARPA zone.

   Consider the same query with the IP6.ARPA NS RRSet described in
   Section 3:

   1.  Query sent to a root server which is also authoritative for ARPA;
       response is a referral to an IP6.ARPA server, with additional-
       section glue.

   2.  Query sent to an IP6.ARPA server; response is a referral from the
       IP6.ARPA zone.

   In the case where the first query is sent to the J root server:

   1.  Query sent to J.ROOT-SERVERS.NET (which is not authoritative for
       ARPA); response is a referral to an ARPA server, with additional-
       section glue.

   2.  Query sent to an ARPA server; response is a referral to an
       IP6.ARPA server with additional-section glue.

   3.  Query sent to an IP6.ARPA server; response is a referral from the
       IP6.ARPA zone.
