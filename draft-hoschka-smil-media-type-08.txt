Abstract

   This document specifies the Media Type for version 1 and version 2 of
   the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL 1.0 and SMIL
   2.0). SMIL allows integrating a set of independent multimedia objects
   into a synchronized multimedia presentation.

1.  Introduction

   The World Wide Web Consortium has issued specifications which define
   version 1 [1] and version 2 [2] of  the Synchronized Multimedia
   Integration Language (SMIL). This memo provides information about the
   application/smil Media Type.

   The definition is based on the RFC3023 defining the use of the
   "application/xml" media type [3]. Before using the "application/smil"
   media type, implementors must thus be familiar with [3].

   RFC 3023 recommends use of the suffix "+xml" for mediatypes that are

   based on XML. This document does not follow this recommendation,
   since the mediatype "application/smil" is already in widespread use,
   and its definition predates RFC3023 by about two years. This does not
   preclude future registration of "application/smil+xml", should the
   need arise.
2.  Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language

   SMIL allows integrating a set of independent multimedia objects into
   a synchronized multimedia presentation. Using SMIL, an author can

   1.describe the temporal behavior of the presentation
   2.describe the layout of the presentation on a screen
   3.associate hyperlinks with media objects
   4.define conditional content inclusion/exclusion based on
   system/network properties

3.  Registration Information

   To: ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of MIME media type application/smil

   MIME media type name: application

   MIME subtype name: smil

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset

   All of the considerations described in RFC3023 also apply to the SMIL
   media type.

Encoding considerations:

All of the considerations described in RFC3023 also apply to the SMIL
media type.

Security considerations:

   SMIL documents contain a construct that allows "infinite loops".
   This is indispensable for a multimedia format. However, SMIL clients
   should foresee provisions such as a "stop" button that lets users
   interrupt such an "infinite loop".

   As with HTML, SMIL documents contain links to other media
   (images,sounds, videos, text, ...) and those links are typically
   followed automatically by software, resulting in the transfer of
   files without the explicit request of the user for each one. The

INTERNET DRAFT                                                 June 2001


   security considerations of each linked file are those of the
   individual registered types.

   The SMIL language contains "switch" elements. SMIL provides no
   mechanism that assures the media objects contained in a "switch"
   element provide equivalent information. An author, knowing that one
   SMIL player will display one alternative of a "switch" and another
   will display a different part, can put different information in the
   two parts. While there are legitimate use cases for this, this also
   gives rise to a security consideration:  The author can fool viewers
   into thinking that the same information was displayed when in fact it
   was not.

   In addition, all of the security considerations of RFC3023 also apply
   to SMIL.

Interoperability considerations:

   SMIL documents contain links to other media objects. The SMIL player
   must be able to decode the media types of these media in order to
   display the whole document. To increase interoperability, SMIL has
   provisions for including alternate versions of a media object in a
   document.

Published specification: see [1] and [2]

Applications which use this media type:

SMIL players and editors

Additional information:

Semantics of fragment identifiers in URIs: The SMIL media type allows to
append a fragment identifier to a URI pointing to a SMIL resource (e.g.
http://www.example.com/test.smil#foo).  The semantics of fragment
identifiers for SMIL resources are defined in [1].

Magic number(s): none

   All of the considerations described in RFC3023 also apply to the SMIL
   media type.

File extension(s): .smil, .smi, .sml

NOTE: On the Windows operating system and the Macintosh
platform, the ".smi" extension is
used by other formats. To avoid conflicts, it is thus
strongly recommended to use the extension ".smil" for storing
