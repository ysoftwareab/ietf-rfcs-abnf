Abstract

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) defines
   the mechanisms for the communication between a Path Computation
   Client (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or among PCEs.
   This document describes the usage of Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   to enhance PCEP security, hence the PCEPS acronym proposed for it.
   The additional security mechanisms are provided by the transport
   protocol supporting PCEP, and therefore they do not affect the
   flexibility and extensibility of PCEP.

   This document updates RFC 5440 in regards to the PCEP initialization
   phase procedures.

1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440]
   defines the mechanisms for the communication between a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or
   between two PCEs.  These interactions include requests and replies
   that can be critical for a sustainable network operation and adequate
   resource allocation, and therefore appropriate security becomes a key
   element in the PCE infrastructure.  As the applications of the PCE
   framework evolves, and more complex service patterns emerge, the
   definition of a secure mode of operation becomes more relevant.

   [RFC5440] analyzes in its section on security considerations the
   potential threats to PCEP and their consequences, and discusses
   several mechanisms for protecting PCEP against security attacks,
   without making a specific recommendation on a particular one or
   defining their application in depth.  Moreover, [RFC6952] remarks the
   importance of ensuring PCEP communication confidentiality, especially
   when PCEP communication endpoints do not reside in the same
   Autonomous System (AS), as the interception of PCEP messages could
   leak sensitive information related to computed paths and resources.

   Among the possible solutions mentioned in these documents, Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] provides support for peer
   authentication, message encryption and integrity.  TLS provides well-
   known mechanisms to support key configuration and exchange, as well
   as means to perform security checks on the results of PCE discovery
   procedures via Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) ([RFC5088] and
   [RFC5089]).

   This document describes a security container for the transport of
   PCEP messages, and therefore it does not affect the flexibility and
   extensibility of PCEP.

   This document describes how to apply TLS to secure interactions with
   PCE, including initiation of the TLS procedures, the TLS handshake
   mechanism, the TLS methods for peer authentication, the applicable
   TLS ciphersuites for data exchange, and the handling of errors in the
   security checks.  In the rest of the document we will refer to this
   usage of TLS to provide a secure transport for PCEP as "PCEPS".

   Within this document, PCEP communications are described through PCC-
   PCE relationship.  The PCE architecture also supports the PCE-PCE

   communication, this is achieved by requesting PCE fill the role of a
   PCC, as usual.  Thus, in this document, the PCC refers to a PCC or a
   PCE initiating the PCEP session and acting as a client.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Applying PCEPS

3.1.  Overview

   The steps involved in establishing a PCEPS session are as follows:

   1.  Establishment of a TCP connection.

   2.  Initiating the TLS procedures by the StartTLS message from PCE to
       PCC and from PCC to PCE.

   3.  Negotiation and establishment of TLS connection.

   4.  Start exchanging PCEP messages as per [RFC5440].

   This document uses the standard StartTLS procedure in PCEP, instead
   of using a different port for the secured session.  This is done to
   avoid requesting allocation of another port number for the PCEPS.
   The StartTLS procedure makes more efficient use of scarce port
   numbers and allow simpler configuration of PCEP.

   Implementations SHOULD follow the best practices and recommendations
   for using TLS, as per [RFC7525].

   It should be noted that this procedure updates what is defined in
   section 4.2.1 and section 6.7 of [RFC5440] regarding the
   initialization phase and the processing of messages prior to the Open
   message.  The details of processing, including backward
   compatibility, are discussed in the following sections.

3.2.  Initiating the TLS Procedures

   Since PCEP can operate either with or without TLS, it is necessary
   for a PCEP speaker to indicate whether it wants to set up a TLS
   connection or not.  For this purpose, this document specifies a new
   PCEP message called StartTLS.  Thus, the PCEP session is secured via



Lopez, et al.             Expires March 8, 2018                 [Page 4]

   TLS from the start before exchange of any other PCEP message (that
   includes the Open message).  This document thus updates [RFC5440],
   which required the Open message to be the first PCEP message that is
   exchanged.  In the case of a PCEP session using TLS, the StartTLS
   message will be sent first.  Also a PCEP speaker that supports PCEPS
   MUST NOT start the OpenWait timer after the TCP establishment,
   instead it starts a StartTLSWait timer as described in Section 3.3.

   The PCEP speaker MAY discover that the PCEP peer supports PCEPS or
   can be preconfigured to use PCEPS for a given peer (see Section 4 for
   more details).  An existing PCEP session cannot be secured via TLS,
   the session MUST be closed and re-established with TLS as per the
   procedure described in this document.

   The StartTLS message is a PCEP message sent by a PCC to a PCE and by
   a PCE to a PCC in order to initiate the TLS procedure for PCEP.  The
   PCC initiates the use of TLS by sending a StartTLS message.  The PCE
   agrees to the use of TLS by responding with its own StartTLS message.
   If the PCE is configured to only support TLS, it may send the
   StartTLS message immediately upon TCP connection establishment;
   otherwise it MUST wait for the PCC's first message to see whether it
   is an Open or a StartTLS message.  The TLS negotiation and
   establishment procedures are triggered once the PCEP speaker has sent
   and received the StartTLS message.  The Message-Type field of the
   PCEP common header for the StartTLS message is set to [TBA1 by IANA].

   Once the TCP connection has been successfully established, the first
   message sent by the PCC to the PCE and by the PCE to the PCC MUST be
   a StartTLS message for the PCEPS.  Note that, this is a significant
   change from [RFC5440], where the first PCEP message is the Open
   message.

   A PCEP speaker receiving a StartTLS message, after any other PCEP
   exchange has taken place (by receiving or sending any other messages
   from either side) MUST treat it as an unexpected message and reply
   with a PCErr message with Error-Type set to [TBA2 by IANA] (PCEP
   StartTLS failure) and Error-value set to 1 (reception of StartTLS
   after any PCEP exchange), and MUST close the TCP connection.

   Any message received prior to StartTLS or Open message MUST trigger a
   protocol error condition causing a PCErr message to be sent with
   Error-Type set to [TBA2 by IANA] (PCEP StartTLS failure) and Error-
   value set to 2 (reception of a message apart from StartTLS or Open)
   and MUST close the TCP connection.

   If the PCEP speaker that does not support PCEPS, receives a StartTLS
   message, it will behave according to the existing error mechanism
   described in section 6.2 of [RFC5440] (in case message is received



Lopez, et al.             Expires March 8, 2018                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          Secure Transport for PCEP         September 2017


   prior to an Open message) or section 6.9 of [RFC5440] (for the case
   of reception of unknown message).  See Section 5 for more details.

   If the PCEP speaker that only supports PCEPS connection (as a local
   policy), receives an Open message, it MUST treat it as an unexpected
   message and reply with a PCErr message with Error-Type set to 1 (PCEP
   session establishment failure) and Error-value set to 1 (reception of
   an invalid Open message or a non Open message), and MUST close the
   TCP connection.

   If a PCC supports PCEPS connections as well as allow non-PCEPS
   connection (as a local policy), it MUST first try to establish PCEPS,
   by sending StartTLS message and in case it receives an PCErr message
   from the PCE, it MAY retry to establish connection without PCEPS by
   sending an Open message.  If a PCE supports PCEPS connections as well
   as allow non-PCEPS connection (as a local policy), it MUST wait to
   respond after TCP establishment, based on the message received from
   the PCC.  In case of StartTLS message, PCE MUST respond with sending
   a StartTLS message and moving to TLS establishment procedures as
   described in this document.  In case of Open message, PCE MUST
   respond with Open message and move to PCEP session establishment
   procedure as per [RFC5440].  If a PCE supports PCEPS connections only
   (as a local policy), it MAY send StartTLS message to PCC without
   waiting to receive a StartTLS message from PCC.

   If a PCEP speaker that is unwilling or unable to negotiate TLS
   receives a StartTLS messages, it MUST return a PCErr message (in
   clear) with Error-Type set to [TBA2 by IANA] (PCEP StartTLS failure)
   and Error-value set to:

   o  3 (Failure, connection without TLS is not possible) if it is not
      willing to exchange PCEP messages without the solicited TLS
      connection, and it MUST close the TCP session.

   o  4 (Failure, connection without TLS is possible) if it is willing
      to exchange PCEP messages without the solicited TLS connection,
      and it MUST close the TCP session.  The receiver MAY choose to
      attempt to re-establish the PCEP session without TLS next.  The
      attempt to re-establish the PCEP session without TLS SHOULD be
      limited to only once.

   If the PCEP speaker supports PCEPS and can establish a TLS connection
   it MUST start the TLS connection negotiation and establishment steps
   described in Section 3.4 before the PCEP initialization procedure
   (section 4.2.1 of [RFC5440]).

   After the exchange of StartTLS messages, if the TLS negotiation fails
   for some reason (e.g. the required mechanisms for certificate

   revocation checking are not available), both peers MUST immediately
   close the connection.

   A PCEP speaker that does not support PCEPS sends the Open message
   directly, as per [RFC5440].  A PCEP speaker that supports PCEPS, but
   has learned in the last exchange the peer's willingness to
   reestablish session without TLS, MAY send the Open message directly,
   as per [RFC5440].  The attempt to re-establish the PCEP session
   without TLS SHOULD be limited to only once.

   Given the asymmetric nature of TLS for connection establishment, it
   is relevant to identify the roles of each of the PCEP peers in it.
   The PCC SHALL act as TLS client, and the PCE SHALL act as TLS server
   as per [RFC5246].

   As per the recommendation from [RFC7525] to avoid downgrade attacks,
   PCEP peers that support PCEPS, SHOULD default to strict TLS
   configuration i.e. do not allow non-TLS PCEP sessions to be
   established.  PCEPS implementations MAY provide an option to allow
   the operator to manually override strict TLS configuration and allow
   unsecured connections.  Execution of this override SHOULD trigger a
   warning about the security implications of permitting unsecured
   connections.

3.3.  The StartTLS Message

   The StartTLS message is used to initiate the TLS procedure for a
   PCEPS session between the PCEP peers.  A PCEP speaker sends the
   StartTLS message to request negotiation and establishment of TLS
   connection for PCEP.  On receiving a StartTLS message from the PCEP
   peer (i.e.  when the PCEP speaker has sent and received StartTLS
   message) it is ready to start the negotiation and establishment of
   TLS and move to steps described in Section 3.4.

   The collision resolution procedures described in [RFC5440] for the
   exchange of Open messages MUST be applied by the PCEP peers during
   the exchange of StartTLS messages.

   The format of a StartTLS message is as follows:


      <StartTLS Message>::= <Common Header>


   The StartTLS message MUST contain only the PCEP common header with
   Message-Type field set to [TBA1 by IANA].

Internet-Draft          Secure Transport for PCEP         September 2017


   Once the TCP connection has been successfully established, the PCEP
   speaker MUST start a timer called StartTLSWait timer, after the
   expiration of which, if neither StartTLS message has been received,
   nor a PCErr/Open message (in case of failure and PCEPS not supported
   by the peer, respectively), it MUST send a PCErr message with Error-
   Type set to [TBA2 by IANA] and Error-value set to 5 (no StartTLS (nor
   PCErr/Open) message received before the expiration of the
   StartTLSWait timer) and it MUST release the TCP connection . A
   RECOMMENDED value for StartTLSWait timer is 60 seconds.  The value of
   StartTLSWait timer MUST NOT be less than OpenWait timer.

3.4.  TLS Connection Establishment

   Once the establishment of TLS has been agreed by the PCEP peers, the
   connection establishment SHALL follow the following steps:

   1.  Immediately negotiate a TLS session according to [RFC5246].  The
       following restrictions apply:

       *  Support for TLS v1.2 [RFC5246] or later is REQUIRED.

       *  Support for certificate-based mutual authentication is
          REQUIRED.

       *  Negotiation of a ciphersuite providing for integrity
          protection is REQUIRED.

       *  Negotiation of a ciphersuite providing for confidentiality is
          RECOMMENDED.

       *  Support for and negotiation of compression is OPTIONAL.

       *  PCEPS implementations MUST, at a minimum, support negotiation
          of the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 [RFC6460], and
          SHOULD support TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 as
          well.  Implementations SHOULD support the NIST P-256
          (secp256r1) curve [RFC4492].  In addition, PCEPS
          implementations MUST support negotiation of the mandatory-to-
          implement ciphersuites required by the versions of TLS that
          they support from TLS 1.3 onwards.

   2.  Peer authentication can be performed in any of the following two
       REQUIRED operation models:



Lopez, et al.             Expires March 8, 2018                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft          Secure Transport for PCEP         September 2017


       *  TLS with X.509 certificates using Public-Key Infrastructure
          Exchange (PKIX) trust models:

          +  Implementations MUST allow the configuration of a list of
             trusted Certification Authorities (CAs) for incoming
             connections.

          +  Certificate validation MUST include the verification rules
             as per [RFC5280].

          +  PCEPS implementations SHOULD incorporate revocation methods
             (CRL downloading, OCSP...) according to the trusted CA
             policies.

          +  Implementations SHOULD indicate their trusted CAs.  For TLS
             1.2, this is done using [RFC5246], Section 7.4.4,
             "certificate_authorities" (server side) and [RFC6066],
             Section 6 "Trusted CA Indication" (client side).

          +  Implementations MUST follow the rules and guidelines for
             peer validation as defined in [RFC6125].  If an expected
             DNS name or IP address for the peer is configured, then the
             implementations MUST check them against the values in the
             presented certificate.  The DNS names and the IP addresses
             can be contained in the CN-ID [RFC6125] (Common Name
             Identifier) or the subjectAltName entries.  For
             verification, only one of these entries is considered.  The
             following precedence applies: for DNS name validation, DNS-
             ID [RFC6125] has precedence over CN-ID; for IP address
             validation, subjectAltName:iPAddr has precedence over CN-
             ID.

          +  Implementations MAY allow the configuration of a set of
             additional properties of the certificate to check for a
             peer's authorization to communicate (e.g., a set of allowed
             values in URI-ID [RFC6125] or a set of allowed X509v3
             Certificate Policies).  The definition of these properties
             are out of scope of this document.

       *  TLS with X.509 certificates using certificate fingerprints:
          Implementations MUST allow the configuration of a list of
          certificates that are trusted to identify peers, identified
          via fingerprint of the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)
          encoded certificate octets.  Implementations MUST support
          SHA-256 as defined by [SHS] as the hash algorithm for the
          fingerprint, but a later revision may demand support for a
          stronger hash function.

   3.  Start exchanging PCEP messages.

       *  Once the TLS connection has been successfully established, the
          PCEP speaker MUST start the OpenWait timer [RFC5440], after
          the expiration of which, if no Open message has been received,
          it sends a PCErr message and releases the TCP/TLS connection.

3.5.  Peer Identity

   Depending on the peer authentication method in use, PCEPS supports
   different operation modes to establish peer's identity and whether it
   is entitled to perform requests or can be considered authoritative in
   its replies.  PCEPS implementations SHOULD provide mechanisms for
   associating peer identities with different levels of access and/or
   authoritativeness, and they MUST provide a mechanism for establishing
   a default level for properly identified peers.  Any connection
   established with a peer that cannot be properly identified SHALL be
   terminated before any PCEP exchange takes place.

   In TLS-X.509 mode using fingerprints, a peer is uniquely identified
   by the fingerprint of the presented certificate.

   There are numerous trust models in PKIX environments, and it is
   beyond the scope of this document to define how a particular
   deployment determines whether a peer is trustworthy.  Implementations
   that want to support a wide variety of trust models should expose as
   many details of the presented certificate to the administrator as
   possible so that the trust model can be implemented by the
   administrator.  At least the following parameters of the X.509
   certificate SHOULD be exposed:

   o  Peer's IP address

   o  Peer's fully qualified domain name (FQDN)

   o  Certificate Fingerprint

   o  Issuer

   o  Subject

   o  All X509v3 Extended Key Usage

   o  All X509v3 Subject Alternative Name

   o  All X509v3 Certificate Policies

Internet-Draft          Secure Transport for PCEP         September 2017


   Note that the remote IP address used for the TCP session
   establishment is also exposed.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-sync-optimizations] specify a Speaker Entity
   Identifier TLV (SPEAKER-ENTITY-ID), as an optional TLV that is
   included in the OPEN Object.  It contains a unique identifier for the
   node that does not change during the lifetime of the PCEP speaker.
   An implementation would thus expose the speaker entity identifier as
   part of the X509v3 certificate's subjectAltName:otherName, so that an
   implementation could use this identifier for the peer identification
   trust model.

   In addition, a PCC MAY apply the procedures described in [RFC6698]
   DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) to verify its peer
   identity when using DNS discovery.  See section Section 4.1 for
   further details.

3.6.  Connection Establishment Failure

   In case the initial TLS negotiation or the peer identity check fails,
   according to the procedures listed in this document, both peers MUST
   immediately close the connection.

   The initiator SHOULD follow the procedure listed in [RFC5440] to
   retry session setup as per the exponential back-off session
   establishment retry procedure.

4.  Discovery Mechanisms

   This document does not specify any discovery mechanism for support of
   PCEPS.  Other documents, [I-D.wu-pce-discovery-pceps-support] and
   [I-D.wu-pce-dns-pce-discovery] have made proposals:

   o  A PCE can advertise its capability to support PCEPS using the
      IGP's advertisement mechanism of the PCE discovery information.
      The PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV is an optional sub-TLV used to advertise
      PCE capabilities.  It is present within the PCE Discovery (PCED)
      sub-TLV carried by OSPF or IS-IS.  [RFC5088] and [RFC5089] provide
      the description and processing rules for this sub-TLV when carried
      within OSPF and IS-IS, respectively.  PCE capability bits are
      defined in [RFC5088].  A new capability flag bit for the PCE-CAP-
      FLAGS sub-TLV that can be announced as an attribute to distribute
      PCEP security support information is proposed in
      [I-D.wu-pce-discovery-pceps-support].

   o  A PCE can advertise its capability to support PCEPS using the DNS
      [I-D.wu-pce-dns-pce-discovery] by identifying the support of TLS.

4.1.  DANE Applicability

   DANE [RFC6698] defines a secure method to associate the certificate
   that is obtained from a TLS server with a domain name using DNS,
   i.e., using the TLSA DNS resource record (RR) to associate a TLS
   server certificate or public key with the domain name where the
   record is found, thus forming a "TLSA certificate association".  The
   DNS information needs to be protected by DNS Security (DNSSEC).  A
   PCC willing to apply DANE to verify server identity MUST conform to
   the rules defined in section 4 of [RFC6698].  The implementation MUST
   support Service certificate constraint (TLSA Certificate Usages type
   1) with Matching type 2 (SHA2-256) as described in
   [RFC6698][RFC7671].  The server's domain name must be authorized
   separately, as TLSA does not provide any useful authorization
   guarantees.

5.  Backward Compatibility

   The procedures described in this document define a security container
   for the transport of PCEP requests and replies carried by a TLS
   connection initiated by means of a specific extended message
   (StartTLS) that does not interfere with PCEP speaker implementations
   not supporting it.

   A PCC that does not support PCEPS will send Open message as the first
   message on TCP establishment.  A PCE that supports PCEPS only, will
   send StartTLS message on TCP establishment.  On receiving StartTLS
   message, PCC would consider it as an error and behave according to
   the existing error mechanism of [RFC5440] and send PCErr message with
   Error-Type 1 (PCEP session establishment failure) and Error-Value 1
   (reception of an invalid Open message or a non Open message) and
   close the session.

   A PCC that support PCEPS will send StartTLS message as the first
   message on TCP establishment.  A PCE that does not supports PCEPS,
   would consider receiving StartTLS message as an error and respond
   with PCErr message (with Error-Type 1 and Error-Value 1) and close
   the session.

   If a StartTLS message is received at any other time by a PCEP speaker
   that does not implement PCEPS, it would consider it as an unknown
   message and would behave according to the existing error mechanism of
   [RFC5440] and send PCErr message with Error-Type 2 (Capability not
   supported) and close the session.

   An existing PCEP session cannot be upgraded to PCEPS, the session
   needs to be terminated and reestablished as per the procedure
   described in this document.  During the incremental upgrade, the PCEP

Internet-Draft          Secure Transport for PCEP         September 2017


   speaker SHOULD allow session establishment with and without TLS.
   Once both PCEP speakers are upgraded to support PCEPS, the PCEP
   session is re-established with TLS, otherwise PCEP session without
   TLS is setup.  A redundant PCE MAY also be used during the
   incremental deployment to take over the PCE undergoing upgrade.  Once
   the upgrade is completed, support for unsecured version SHOULD be
   removed.

   A PCE that accepts connections with or without PCEPS, it would
   respond based on the message received from PCC.  A PCC that supports
   connection with or without PCEPS, it would first attempt to connect
   with PCEPS and in case of error, it MAY retry to establish connection
   without PCEPS.  For successful TLS operations with PCEP, both PCEP
   peers in the network would need to be upgraded to support this
   document.

   Note that, a PCEP implementation that support PCEPS would respond
   with PCErr message with Error-Type set to [TBA2 by IANA] (PCEP
   StartTLS failure) and Error-value set to 2 if any other message is
   sent before StartTLS or Open.  If the sender of the invalid message
   is a PCEP implementation that does not support PCEPS, it will not be
   able to understand this error.  A PCEPS implementation could also
   send the PCErr message as per [RFC5440] with Error-Type "PCEP session
   establishment failure" and Error-value "reception of an invalid Open
   message or a non Open message" before closing the session.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  New PCEP Message

   IANA is requested to allocate new message types within the "PCEP
   Messages" sub-registry of the PCEP Numbers registry, as follows:

      Value  Description                             Reference
       TBA1  The Start TLS Message (StartTLS)        This document

6.2.  New Error-Values

   IANA is requested to allocate new Error Types and Error Values within
   the " PCEP-ERROR Object Error Types and Values" sub-registry of the
   PCEP Numbers registry, as follows:

7.  Security Considerations

   While the application of TLS satisfies the requirement on
   confidentiality as well as fine-grained, policy-based peer
   authentication, there are security threats that it cannot address.
   It may be advisable to apply additional protection measures, in
   particular in what relates to attacks specifically addressed to
   forging the TCP connection underpinning TLS, especially in the case
   of long-lived connections.  One of these measures is the application
   of TCP-AO (TCP Authentication Option [RFC5925]), which is fully
   compatible with and deemed as complementary to TLS.  The mechanisms
   to configure the requirements to use TCP-AO and other lower-layer
   protection measures with a particular peer are outside the scope of
   this document.

   Since computational resources required by TLS handshake and
   ciphersuite are higher than unencrypted TCP, clients connecting to a
   PCEPS server can more easily create high load conditions and a
   malicious client might create a Denial-of-Service attack more easily.

   Some TLS ciphersuites only provide integrity validation of their
   payload, and provide no encryption, such ciphersuites SHOULD NOT be
   used by default.  Administrators MAY allow the usage of these
   ciphersuites after careful weighting of the risk of relevant internal
   data leakage, that can occur in such a case, as explicitly stated by
   [RFC6952].

   When using certificate fingerprints to identify PCEPS peers, any two
   certificates that produce the same hash value will be considered the
   same peer.  Therefore, it is important to make sure that the hash
   function used is cryptographically uncompromised, so that attackers
   are very unlikely to be able to produce a hash collision with a
   certificate of their choice.  This document mandates support for
   SHA-256 as defined by [SHS], but a later revision may demand support
   for stronger functions if suitable attacks on it are known.

   PCEPS implementations that continue to accept connections without TLS
   are susceptible to downgrade attacks as described in [RFC7457].  An
   attacker could attempt to remove the use of StartTLS message that
   request the use of TLS as it pass on the wire in clear, and further
   inject a PCErr message that suggest to attempt PCEP connection
   without TLS.

   The guidance given in [RFC7525] SHOULD be followed to avoid attacks
   on TLS.

8.  Manageability Considerations

   All manageability requirements and considerations listed in [RFC5440]
   apply to PCEP protocol extensions defined in this document.  In
   addition, requirements and considerations listed in this section
   apply.

8.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   A PCE or PCC implementation SHOULD allow configuring the PCEP
   security via TLS capabilities as described in this document.

   A PCE or PCC implementation supporting PCEP security via TLS MUST
   support general TLS configuration as per [RFC5246].  At least the
   configuration of one of the trust models and its corresponding
   parameters, as described in Section 3.4 and Section 3.5, MUST be
   supported by the implementation.

   A PCEP implementation SHOULD allow configuring the StartTLSWait timer
   value.

   PCEPS implementations MAY provide an option to allow the operator to
   manually override strict TLS configuration and allow unsecure
   connections.  Execution of this override SHOULD trigger a warning
   about the security implications of permitting unsecure connections.

   Further, the operator needs to develop suitable security policies
   around PCEP within his network.  The PCEP peers SHOULD provide ways

   for the operator to complete the following tasks in regards to a PCEP
   session:

   o  Determine if a session is protected via PCEPS.

   o  Determine the version of TLS, the mechanism used for
      authentication, and the ciphersuite in use.

   o  Determine if the certificate could not be verified, and the reason
      for this circumstance.

   o  Inspect the certificate offered by the PCEP peer.

   o  Be warned if StartTLS procedure fails for the PCEP peers, that are
      known to support PCEPS via configurations or capability
      advertisements.

8.2.  Information and Data Models

   The PCEP MIB module is defined in [RFC7420].  The MIB module could be
   extended to include the ability to view the PCEPS capability, TLS
   related information as well as TLS status for each PCEP peer.

   Further, to allow the operator to configure the PCEPS capability and
   various TLS related parameters as well as to view the current TLS
   status for a PCEP session, the PCEP YANG module
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-yang] is extended to include TLS related
   information.

8.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440] and [RFC5246].

8.4.  Verifying Correct Operations

   A PCEPS implementation SHOULD log error events and provide PCEPS
   failure statistics with reasons.

8.5.  Requirements on Other Protocols

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new requirements
   on other protocols.  Note that, Section 4 list possible discovery
   mechanism for support of PCEPS.

8.6.  Impact on Network Operation

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not have any significant
   impact on network operations in addition to those already listed in
   [RFC5440], and the policy and management implications discussed
   above.
