     1 Abstract 
         
        The mobile wireless access networks are converging towards IP-based 
        architecture that enables interconnect of different layer 2 radio 
        access systems. IP-based local (or micro) mobility management (LMM) 
        solution is the key to unify the different layer 2 mobility 
        management solutions in the new architecture. This draft defines a 
        LMM framework that supports localized IP route re-direction at the 
        edge of Internet. The proposed framework unifies the route re-
        direction related signals and allows intelligent handoff algorithms 
        to coordinate the route re-direction process to achieve desired 
        handoff performance. In this framework, a mobile node keeps its 
        routable IP address un-changed when it moves within a local mobility 
        domain such that the correspondent nodes do not need to be informed 
        about the local movement of the mobile node. The basic concept of 
        this framework is the discovery of the set of network nodes that 
        have to be updated when handoffs occur between access ports. 
        Therefore, the handoff intelligence can modify the forwarding state 
        of the set of handoff-affected routers as the mobile node moves 
        through the network. This framework provides the basis for developing 
        different handoff control algorithms.

                      Local Mobility Management Framework       July, 2001 
     2 Introduction 
         
        Mobility management is an important service in future Internet to 
        support large amount of mobile devices. This draft defines a local 
        mobility management framework that supports IP mobility by 
        localizing the route redirection at the edge of the Internet. This 
        framework has two basic architecture assumptions: 
         
        - Firstly, the Internet mobility management should separate mobile 
          routing from the reachability discovery so that the IP addresses 
          are solely used for routing purposes. It eliminates the need of 
          using home addresses as the identity of mobile nodes. This 
          separation allows the integration of the advances in directory and 
          location services in the mobility management. 
         
        - Secondly, this framework further assumes that local mobility 
          management is independent of the macro-mobility schemes (e.g., 
          MIP, end-to-end session migration) used by the mobile nodes. The 
          local mobility management is complementary to the macro-mobility 
          management to reduce the amount of mobility related signals 
          between communication peers. Local mobility management aims to re-
          direct route towards the handoff MNs at the network nodes that are 
          close to where the handoff takes place while allowing MN to keep 
          its routable IP address after handoff. Allowing a MN to keep its 
          address after handoff enables the localization of handoff signals 
          and results in fast and consistent handoff performance. 
      
        The objectives of this local mobility framework are following: 
         
        - Reduce the number of far reach signals by limiting the route re-
          direction as close to the handoff mobile nodes as possible. 
         
        - Unify the route re-direction activities in one signaling framework 
          such that the handoff intelligence can coordinate these activities 
          to achieve desirable handoff performance. This departs from the 
          current MIP approach that uses different protocols for path 
          extension (i.e., extends tunnel from old access router to the new 
          one as in Fast handoff for MIP)[8], and path switching (i.e., 
          replaces, at a crossover router, the tunnel to the old access 
          router with the one to the new access router as in Hierarchical 
          MIP)[5]). In terms of route re-direction, HMIP and FHIP do the 
          similar thing that is to re-direct IP routes towards a handoff 
          mobile at the nodes that are affected by the MN handoff. 
         
        - Enable topology independent route re-direction protocol to avoid 
          arbitrary development of topology specific route redirection 
          protocols. The examples of topology specific approaches are flat 
          HMIP for star topology, Regional Registration for tree topology 
          [6], and Fast Handoff for chain topology. 
         
        - Support distributed forwarding state that enables the distribution 
          of signaling and data traffic over the network nodes to avoid 
          signalling and data traffic concentration points and eliminate the 
          single point of failure in the network.

        The rest of this draft will first describe the network reference 
        architecture and define the terminology covering certain concepts 
        related to this framework. In section 4, an overview of the local 
        mobility management framework is described. Section 5 presents a 
        local mobility management solution developed based on the framework. 
        Section 6 discusses the mapping of the route re-direction capability 
        of the framework to star, tree, and chain network topologies. 
        Finally, section 9 summarizes the key concepts of this framework. 
      
         
     3 Reference architecture and terminology 
         
     3.1 Mobile wireless access network model 
         
        The IP-based mobile wireless access network model considered in this 
        draft consists of interconnected IP routers attached to the Internet 
        backbone, and provides Internet access to mobile users through 
        various types of radio interfaces (e.g., UMTS, CDMA2000, WLAN). A 
        local mobility management domain is assumed to consist of multiple 
        subnets that are interconnected by routers in a general topology. An 
        intra-domain routing protocol (IGP) (e.g., OSPF or RIP) is used for 
        determining the forwarding paths towards the fixed nodes in this 
        network. The LMM protocol is therefore responsible for determining 
        the forwarding paths towards the mobile nodes and re-directing those 
        paths when the MNs change their points of attachment. Note that the 
        routers in figure 1 could be application level routing agents that 
        are configured as an overlay network on top of the IP-based wireless 
        access network. Various types of tunnels can be used to interconnect 
        the nodes (i.e., routing agents) in an overlay network.

     3.2 Definitions 
         
        Mobile Node (MN) 
      
     Li                Informational-Expires January 2002                 3 
                      Local Mobility Management Framework       July, 2001 
          An IP node capable of changing its point of attachment to the 
          network. 
         
        Access Port (AP) 
          An interface of an Access Router (defined later) for transmitting 
          data to or receiving data from Mobile Nodes. 
         
        Access Router (AR) 
          An IP router in an access network that interconnects different IP 
          subnets and may also have APs to provide network access to MNs. An 
          AR has at least two interfaces, and at least one of them must 
          connect to another AR or Internet backbone. 
      
        Access Network (AN) 
          An IP network with one or more subnets that are interconnected by 
          ARs. An AN may connected to the Internet backbone through 
          gateways. 
         
        Mobile Aware Router (MAR) 
          An AR that has the capability and is configured to track the 
          mobile node's current point of attachment (i.e., access port). It 
          forwards the IP packets destined to a MN towards its current point 
          of attachment. 
         
          If all the ARs in an access network are MARs, each AR knows where 
          to forward the IP packets towards the mobile nodes. If only a 
          subset of the ARs are MAR, tunnels can be used to connect the MARs 
          into an overlay network such that the data packets can be tunneled 
          through the non-MARs between a pair of MARs. Therefore, mobile 
          routing protocol can operate among the MARs no matter it is used 
          in all the ARs of an access network or a subset of ARs that form a 
          logical overlay network. 
         
        Local Mobility Domain  
          A local mobility domain contains one or more IP subnets. Within the 
          local mobility domain, the routable IP address assigned to a mobile 
          node does not change. 
         
        Handoff Affected Router Group (HARG) 
          A set of MARs whose forwarding tables must be updated when a MN 
          moves its point of attachment from one AP to another. 
                                    
         
     4 Overview of local mobility management framework 
      
     4.1 Mobile reachability 
         
        This draft assumes a mobility management architecture that separates 
        the reachability discovery and the mobile routing functions in 
        Internet. In this architecture, an application can use any 
        reachability discovery service as long as it provides the 
        appropriate name-to-location binding in a timely fashion [7]. The 
        reachability discovery services are used at the beginning of a 
      

     Li                Informational-Expires January 2002                 4 
                      Local Mobility Management Framework       July, 2001 
        session between communication peers to determine the IP address 
        currently in use by a MN. To keep the mobile node "always-on", the 
        reachability discovery service may collaborate with paging service 
        to activate the mobile nodes that are not active. Paging service can 
        locate an MN in a specified domain and alert it to attach to the 
        network. 
         
     4.2 Mobile attachment process 
         
        When a mobile node attaches to the network, it must obtain a 
        routable IP address by using either stateful (e.g., DHCP) or 
        stateless (e.g., IPv6 auto-configuration) address allocation 
        mechanisms in the local domain [3]. The attachment process might be 
        initiated by mobile node itself or by an attachment request from the 
        correspondent node via reachability discovery service. After 
        acquiring an IP address, the mobile node must register its 
        identification with the IP address to the reachability discovery 
        service to establish the global reachability. 
         
     4.3 Mobile tracking process 
         
        In this framework, a MN's IP address is allocated from the aggregated 
        prefix assigned to the AP that is a topologically correct IP address. 
        As the MN moves, the allocated IP address stays with it so that there 
        is no need to inform the correspondent nodes of the move and the 
        higher-layer sessions are unaffected by the change of attachment 
        point. This is accomplished by the LMM routing protocol modifying the 
        intra-domain routing  tables to reflect the new AP used by the MN. 
        When the HARG members receive the route update request, they can 
        decide to use prefix based forwarding or host specific forwarding for 
        the handoff MN. Host specific route is only required as the MN moves 
        with active sessions, therefore the associated scaling properties are 
        governed by number of MNs in-session rather than longer term roaming 
        population [4]. 
      
        HARG defines the set of network nodes that need to be updated due to 
        the MN handoffs. Identifying HARG enables localization of the 
        routing update messages to avoid every router in the domain having to 
        track the mobility of every MN. HARG has some unique characteristics 
        in supporting mobility in this framework. First, the HARG members 
        are "close" to where the handoff occurs because handoff is a local 
        phenomenon that should affect only those routers near to the old and 
        new APs. Second, the set of routers affected by a MN handoff from an 
        APa to an APb is the same as the set of router affected by MN 
        handoffs from the APb to the APa. Third, the set of affected routers 
        is static if there is no change in the network topology. 
        Furthermore, HARG membership can be determined at the network boot-
        up time and it may change when there is a topology change in the 
        access network. 
         
        The local mobility management framework does not track the out of 
        session MNs, which is instead left to reachability discovery 
        services. The host specific routing enables the MN to continue to use 
        the acquired address in-session instead of updating it at each new 
      
     Li                Informational-Expires January 2002                 5 
                      Local Mobility Management Framework       July, 2001 
        access router as required by normal Mobile IP [2,3]. Similarly, the 
        mobile routing protocol is limited to tracking intra-domain mobility 
        and relies on macro mobility management protocol (e.g. Mobile IP) to 
        handle inter-domain handoffs. 
      
     4.4 Handoff control mechanism 
         
        In this framework, we assume a standardized handoff trigger will 
        initiate the handoff process. This trigger provides the address 
        information about the MN's old and new APs. With the identified HARG, 
        the handoff control algorithms only need to update the forwarding 
        states for a handoff MN at the HARG members. As the HARG members are 
        "close" to the APs where the handoff occurs, the handoff related 
        signals are localized. The handoff control algorithms can signal the 
        HARG members in different order and request certain behavior from 
        different HARG members. For instance, if a handoff algorithm requires 
        to extend the path from the old AP to the new one before switching at 
        ARs inside the access network, it can first signal the ARs in the 
        HARG for establishing path extension and then signal the ARs in HARG 
        when the stable layer 3 connectivity at the new AP has been 
        established for the handoff MN. The capability of HARG members can be 
        reported to the AP such that the handoff algorithm can program the 
        MARs to achieve desired handoff performance. The examples of HARG 
        member's capabilities may include tunneling, buffering, multicast, 
        QoS, etc. 
      
      
     5 Realization of the local mobility management framework 
         
        This section discusses a potential implementation of LMM based on 
        the proposed framework. The functional components of the framework 
        are identified in Figure 2. In the access port, the LMM client 
        performs the HARG member discovery, handoff coordination, and layer 
        2 interactions. The IP/layer2 mapping performs translation between 
        IP packets and layer 2 radio frames and may provide handoff triggers 
        to the LMM client. Both LMM server and routing protocol reside in 
        the control plane of the AR. The routing protocol could be any IGP 
        protocol (e.g., OSPF or RIP) that is used to support routing for 
        fixed nodes in the access network. The LMM server maintains the 
        hosting router's membership state in HARGs, re-directs IP flows 
        towards MN's current point of attachment and injects host specific 
        routing entries in the forwarding engine. 
         
        There are three LMM specific interfaces among the functional 
        entities in Figure 2. The interface I1 can be used for conveying 
        layer-2 handoff trigger to the LMM client. The interface I2 is for 
        exchanging HARG membership management and the handoff control 
        messages between the LMM clients and servers. The interface I3 is 
        for LMM server to control the forwarding engine of the hosting 
        router to re-direct forwarding paths with required behaviors.

        The rest of this section describes a LMM protocol suite over 
        interface I2 that realizes the defined LMM framework. The LMM 
        protocol suite includes three protocols namely Handoff Affected 
        Router Discovery Protocol (HARDP), Mobile Registration Protocol 
        (MRP), and Handoff Control Protocol (HCP). The HARDP identifies a 
        set of MARs that needs to update their forwarding state for any MN 
        handoff between APs. The MRP handles the initial message exchange 
        for a MN to gain access to the access network. It establishes 
        initial forwarding state for the registered MNs at all the MARs of 
        an access network. The HCP is responsible for signaling the MARs to 
        update the forwarding state for the handoff MNs.  
      
     5.1 Handoff affected router discovery protocol (HARDP) 
      
        HARG[a, b] is the set of routers that will be affected by the mobile 
        handoff between APa and APb. Routers in HARG[a, b] have different 
        next hop forwarding paths to APa and APb. HARDP uses this 
        characteristic of the routers to determine the membership of HARG[a, 
        b] and the HARG members join/leave the HARG using Internet Group 
        Management Protocol (IGMP) The HARGs are determined using HARDP at 
        network boot-up time and membership in a HARG remains static unless 
        there is a change in network topology.

     5.2 Mobile Registration Process 
      
        The Mobile Registration Protocol handles the initial message 
        exchange for a mobile to gain access to the network. The main 
        function performed by the protocol is to provide IP connectivity for 
        the mobile. A mobile can attach to the access network voluntarily or 
        in response to a request from correspondent nodes. The voluntary 
        attachment is the situation when a mobile user wants to communicate 
        with others while the on request attachment is the situation that 
        other correspondent nodes want to communicate with the user. When a 
        correspondent node wants to reach the mobile user, it can use 
        reachability discovery service to request the mobile to attach to 
        the network. Regardless how a MN is initiated to attach to the 
        network, it has to obtain a routable IP address and register this 
        new address with its identity to the reachability discovery services 
        that the mobile user is willing to expose his reachability. 
         
        A mobile can obtain its IP address through either stateful DHCP 
        allocation or stateless auto-configuration.  
         
        Within the AN, local reachability for the mobile is implicitly 
        established by the routing protocol of the access network. MN is 
        also required to register its newly assigned IP address to the 
        reachability discovery service for establishing global reachability. 
        A MN can use Mobile IP or other reachability discovery services 
        (e.g. DNS, SIP) for global reachability. 
         
     5.3 Handoff Control Protocol (HCP) 
      
        The HCP assumes that HARDP has already been executed to identify the 
        HARGs. The group of routers in the HARG needs to be informed about 
        the handoff since each node needs to update its forwarding table to 
        reflect a new "IP address to next-hop router" mapping. The following 
        described handoff control protocol assumes the HARGs are multicast 
        groups and the HCP uses a multicast protocol to signal the members 
        in the HARGs for updating their forwarding state. This HCP uses a 
        simple handoff control algorithm that is updating all the MARs in 
        the HARG at the same time. It is obvious that more sophisticated 
        handoff control algorithms can be developed. 
      
        Consider a MN, which is attached to APa and then moves to APb. 
        During the handoff, a LOCATION_UPDATE message is multicast by APb to 
        the HARG[a, b] which includes the 3-tuple, <new AP= APb IP address, 
        MN IP address, sequence number>. APb may obtain the sequence number 
        of the handoff message from the MN where it is incremented each time 
        a handoff is executed, or APb may generate the sequence number using 
        a network synchronized timestamp such as GPS. Routers use the 
        sequence number to ensure that the update from a later location 
        update message is not overwritten by an update from an earlier 
        location update message that got delayed in the network.  
      
        Each MAR that receives the message executes its route update 
        algorithm to indicate that packets destined for the MN are to be 
        forwarded towards APb.

     6 Discussions 
         
        This section discusses the instantiations of the LMM framework in 
        typical overlay network topologies that are used in existing local 
        mobility management approaches. Various topology specific LMM 
        proposals have been made to IETF MIP working group in last two 
        years. These proposals require the MARs to form an overlay network 
        on top of the access network infrastructure. The typical overlay 
        network topologies are star in flat HMIP [5], tree in regional 
        registration [6], and chain in Fast Handoff [8]. These proposals 
        have the same function in term of updating forwarding state at MARs 
        that is re-directing tunnels towards the new attachment point of the 
        handoff MN. The key difference among these proposals is the updating 
        of topology specific HARG members. The HARG membership is configured 
        statically in these proposals such that the handoff control 
        algorithm can update forwarding state at the right MARs. The 
        fundamental problem of developing topology specific protocols is the 
        limited scope of each individual protocol and results in 
        overwhelming number of protocols that have the similar capability. 
        Furthermore, this approach will impose topological restriction on 
        the MAR deployment. The rest of this section will demonstrate that 
        the proposed LMM framework is a more generic framework that is 
        capable of handling route re-direction in different overlay network 
        topology. For simplicity, the following examples of network topology 
        assume that each AR connects to only one AP such that handoffs 
        between APs can be considered as handoffs between the respective 
        ARs. 
         
     6.1  Star topology 
         
        The MARs are connected into a star topology in Figure 3. The 
        handoffs between AR1 and AR2 will affect three MARs: AR1, AR2, AR5. 
        Therefore, the HARG[AR1, AR2] = {AR1, AR2, AR5}. The routes for a MN 
        handoff between AR1 and AR2 should be re-directed in these three 
        nodes. One example of handoff control algorithm could be that the 
        LMM client at the AR2 signals the HARG[AR1, AR2] members to request 
        path re-direction. The route re-direction operation at the AR5 is 
        considered as a path switching while the operation in AR1 is a path 
        extension. Another example of the algorithm could be that the LMM 
        client signals only the AR5 for path re-direction and this results 
        in a path switching at the AR5 without requiring a path extension at 
        AR1. The two example handoff control algorithms may result in 
        different handoff performance (e.g., packet loss). Network operators 
        should have the options to select handoff control algorithms that 
        suit for their needs.

     6.2 Tree topology 
         
        The MARs are connected into a tree topology in Figure 4. There are 
        tunnels between adjacent ARs that have APs (i.e., AR1, AR2, AR3). In 
        this configuration, HARG[AR1, AR2] = {AR1, AR2, AR4}. The handoffs 
        between AR1 and AR2 may require path re-direction at these three 
        nodes. Assume the handoff control algorithm requires updating all 
        the HARG members at the same time, the route re-direction operation 
        at AR4 is a path switching while the operation in AR1 is a path 
        extension. The HARG[AR2, AR3] = {AR2, AR3, AR4, AR5, AR6}. If the 
        access network uses the same handoff control algorithm, the route 
        re-direction operations at AR4, AR5, and AR6 are path switching 
        operations and the operation at AR2 is a path extension.

        members. In figure 5, HARG[AR1, AR2] = {AR1, AR2}. When a MN handoff 
        from AR1 to AR2, the location update signals for HARG members will 
        result in a path extension from AR1 to AR2 for the MN

     9 Summary 
         
        This draft proposed a generic framework for local mobility 
        management that unifies the route re-direction signals and allows 
        the handoff control algorithm to coordinate the handoff related 
        activities to achieve desired outcomes. This framework introduces 
        the concept of Handoff Affected Router Group (HARG) that identifies 
        the set of local routers to be signaled when a handoff occurs 
        between APs. With HARG, the framework enables localized and 
        programmable signaling in handoff process. Host specific routing 
        technology may be used to support mobility in this framework that 
        allows a mobile node to keep its locally allocated IP address as 
        long as it moves within the LMM network domain, and therefore, 
        reduce the amount of signals to the correspondent nodes.  
         
        This framework enables the distribution of the MN forwarding states 
        over the network nodes and avoids creating traffic and signalling 
        concentration points and therefore eliminates single point of 
        failure.
