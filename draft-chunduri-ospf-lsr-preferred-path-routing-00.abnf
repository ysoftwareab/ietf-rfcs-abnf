      IA-Flag: Inter-Area flag.  If set, advertisement is of inter-area
      type.  An Area Boarder Router (ABR) that is advertising the OSPF
      PPR TLV between areas MUST set this bit.

      A: The originator of the PPR TLV MUST set the A bit in order to
      signal that the prefixes and PPR-IDs advertised in the PPR TLV are
      directly connected to the originators.  If this bit is not set,
      this allows any other node in the network advertise this TLV on
      behalf of the originating node of the "OSPF Prefix".  If PPR TLV
      is propagated to other areas the A-flag MUST be cleared.  In case
      if the originating node of the prefix has to be disambiguated for





      any reason including, if it is a Multi Homed Prefix (MHP) or
      propagated to a different OSPF area, then PPR-Attribute sub-TLV
      Source Router ID SHOULD be included.

      Rsrvd: reserved bits for future use.  Reserved bits MUST be reset
      on transmission and ignored on receive.
