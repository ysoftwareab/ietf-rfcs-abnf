                        draft-ietf-bier-mtud-00

Abstract

   This document defines an IGP based mechanism for discovering the MTU
   of a BIER sub-domain.  This document defines extensions to OSPF and
   IS-IS, but other protocols could potentially be extended.  MTU
   discovery is usually done for a given path, while this document
   defines it for a sub-domain.  This allows the computed MTU to be
   independent of the set of receivers.  Also, the MTU is independent of
   rerouting events within the sub-domain.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines an IGP based mechanism for discovering the MTU
   of a BIER sub-domain.  The discovered MTU indicates the largest
   possible BIER packet that can be sent across any link in a BIER sub-
   domain.  This is different from [I-D.ietf-bier-path-mtu-discovery]
   which performs Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) for a set of receivers.
   PMTUD is based on probing, and when there are routing changes, e.g.,
   a link going down, the actual MTU for a path may become less than was
   previously discovered, and there will be some delay until the next
   probe is performed.  Also, the set of receivers for a flow may change
   at any time, which may cause the MTU to change.  This document
   instead discovers a BIER sub-domain MTU, which is independent of
   paths and receivers within the sub-domain.

   Discovering the sub-domain MTU is much simpler than discovering the
   multicast path MTU, and is more robust with regards to path changes
   as discussed above.  However, the sub-domain MTU may be a lot smaller
   than the path MTU would have been for a given flow.  The discovery
   mechanisms may be combined, allowing the discovery of the path MTU
   for certain flows as needed.

   The BIER sub-domain MTU defined here provides the maximum size of a
   BIER packet that can be forwarded through the sub-domain regardless
   of path.  A BIER router that performs BIER encapsulation will need to
   subtract the encapsulation overhead to find the largest size packet
   that can be encapsulated.  This would give the IP MTU, and may be

   used for IP PMTUD by for instance sending an ICMP Packet too big
   message if an IP packet will be too large after BIER encapsulation.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  MTU discovery procedure

   An interface on a router is said to be a BIER interface if the router
   has a BIER neighbor on the interface.  That is, there is a directly
   connected router on that interface that is announcing a BIER prefix.
   Further, the BIER interface is said to belong to a given sub-domain
   if the router itself announces a prefix tagged with the sub-domain,
   and there is BIER neighbor on the interface also announcing a prefix
   tagged with the sub-domain.

   The BIER MTU of an interface is the largest BIER packet that can be
   sent out of the interface.  Further, the local sub-domain MTU of a
   router is the minimum of all the BIER MTUs of the BIER interfaces in
   the sub-domain.  Note that the local sub-domain MTU of a router is
   only defined if it has at least one BIER interface in the sub-domain.

   A BIER router announces a BIER prefix in either IS-IS or OSPF as
   specified in [RFC8401] and [RFC8444].  They both define a BIER Sub-
   TLV to be included with the prefix.  There is one BIER Sub-TLV
   included for each sub-domain.  This document defines how a router
   includes its local sub-domain MTU in each of the BIER Sub-TLVs it
   advertizes.

   A router can discover the MTU of a BIER sub-domain by identifying all
   the prefixes that have a BIER Sub-TLV for the sub-domain.  It then
   computes the minimum of the advertised MTU values for that sub-
   domain.  This includes its own local sub-domain MTU.  This allows all
   the routers in the sub-domain to discover the same sub-domain wide
   MTU.

   Note that a router should announce a new local MTU for a sub-domain
   immediately if the value becomes smaller than what it currently
   announces.  This would happen if the MTU of an interface is
   configured to a smaller value, or the first BIER neighbor for a sub-
   domain is detected on an interface, and the MTU of the interface is
   less than all the other local BIER interfaces in the sub-domain.
   However, if BIER neighbors go away, or if an interface goes down, so

   that the local MTU becomes larger, a router SHOULD NOT immediately
   announce the larger value.  A router MAY after some delay announce
   the new larger MTU.  The intention is that dynamic events such as a
   quick link flap should not cause the announced MTU to be increased.

   It is a concern that the sub-domain MTU will be based on the link
   with the smallest MTU.  This means that if for instance a single link
   is accidentally configured with an extra small MTU, it will impact
   the sub-domain MTU and potentially all the flows through the sub-
   domain.  As an example, an administrator might decide to use jumbo
   frames and has configured that on all the links.  But accidentally
   forget to configure it on a new link before it is brought up.  To
   provide some protection against this, an implementation SHOULD
   provide a configurable minimum BIER sub-domain MTU.  When this is
   configured, the MTU discovery is still done according to the above
   procedure, but if the resulting MTU value is less than the configured
   minimum, the configured minimum MUST be used instead.  If the
   discovery procedure later should provide an MTU larger than the
   minimum, then the discovered MTU MUST be used.  An implementation
   SHOULD provide notification to the administrator when the discovered
   MTU is less than the minimum, as this is likely a configuration
   mistake that should be corrected.

4.  IS-IS BIER Sub-Domain MTU Sub-sub-TLV

   A router uses the BIER Sub-Domain MTU Sub-sub-TLV to announce the
   minimum BIER MTU of all its BIER enabled interfaces in a sub-domain.
   The BIER Sub-Domain MTU is the largest BIER packet that can be sent
   out of all the interfaces in a sub-domain.  The Sub-sub-TLV MUST be
   ignored if it is included multiple times.

   A router uses the BIER Sub-Domain MTU Sub-TLV to announce the minimum
   BIER MTU of all its BIER enabled interfaces in a sub-domain.  The
   BIER Sub-Domain MTU is the largest BIER packet that can be sent out
   of all the interfaces in a sub-domain.  The Sub-TLV MUST be ignored
   if it is included multiple times.

6.  IANA considerations

   An allocation from the "sub-sub-TLVs for BIER Info sub-TLV" registry
   as defined in [RFC8401] is requested for the IS-IS BIER Sub-Domain
   MTU Sub-sub-TLV.  Please replace the string TBD in this document with
   the appropriate value.

   An allocation from the "OSPF Extended Prefix sub-TLV" registry as
   defined in [RFC7684] is requested for the OSPF BIER Sub-Domain MTU
   Sub-TLV.  Please replace the string TBD2 in this document with the
   appropriate value.
