Internet-Draft       Draft Information Requirements        February 2005


1.  Introduction

   Public Internet-Drafts are primary means of structured communication
   within IETF.  The information that IETF currently provides about any
   given draft is decentralized and often insufficient to facilitate
   on-going draft review and use by IETFers and 3rd parties.  The IETF
   Tools team recommends creation of a single, authoritative, and
   comprehensive IETF source for draft information.  This document
   specifies what information IETF should provide about a draft and, to
   a limited extent, how that information needs to be provided.

   Most, if not all, requirements in this document are inspired by
   existing sources of draft information, both on official IETF web
   sites and sites administered outside of IETF.

2.  State of this draft version

   This draft version is meant to contain a complete list of draft
   information items.  Some items need more documentation and
   supplementary sections are missing content.  This version may not
   represent Tools team consensus.  The text has not been polished.

   Please review this draft.  Did we miss any draft information items
   you want IETF to provide? Should we remove some of the items?  We are
   also looking for additional pointers to resources providing useful
   draft information.  Please post your comments on
   tools-discuss@ietf.org mailing list or email them directly to the
   author.

   RFC Editor Note: Please remove this section for the final publication
   of the document.  It has been inspired by
   draft-rousskov-newtrk-id-state and related NEWTRK WG discussions.

3.  Scope

   The document scope is a single Internet-Draft, including multiple
   versions and formats of the same draft.  Requirements cover
   submitted, posted, published, expired, and unknown personal or
   Working Group drafts.

   The interfaces required to locate a draft or correlate information
   about multiple drafts are out of scope.

4.  Notation and Terminology

   The following terms are to be interpreted according to their
   definitions below.  [[XXX2: Should we just refer to
   draft-ietf-tools-draft-submission, which has the same definitions?

Internet-Draft       Draft Information Requirements        February 2005


   --Alex]]

   posted draft: A draft accepted into public IETF draft repository and,
      hence, publicly available on IETF web site.

   draft version: A meant-to-be-public snapshot of an Internet-Draft
      with a meant-to-be-unique version number.  Also known as a "draft
      revision".

   draft format: Any draft source or presentation format, including
      original and preprocessed XML, original or generated plain text as
      well as PDF, PostScript, and HTML formats.

   primary draft format: The first available draft format from the
      following list: plain text, PDF, PostScript, or XML.

   WG draft: A draft which identifier (a.k.a.  filename) is known and
      starts with "draft-ietf-".

   individual draft: A draft other than a WG draft.

   Normative requirements in this document are English phrases ending
   with an "(Rnnn/s)" mark, where "nnn" is a unique requirement number,
   and "s" is a single letter code ("a", "b", or "c") specifying the
   implementation stage for the requirement.  Implementation stages are
   documented in Section 10.  [[XXX1: Normative requirements have not
   been identified yet.  --Alex]]

   This document does not specify how the implementation must obtain
   necessary draft information and does not require specific information
   rendering techniques.  However, implementation hints or examples are
   often useful.  To avoid mix up with normative requirements, such
   hints and examples are marked with a "Hint:" prefix.  Implementation
   hints do not carry any normative force, and a different
   implementation may be the best choice.

5.  Status quo

   At the time of writing, all of the draft information pieces described
   in this document are already available in one form or another.  Here
   is an incomplete list of resources providing draft information.  Note
   that provided information outside of this draft scope is not
   mentioned here.

   o  IETF "Internet-Drafts Database Interface" [1]: Provides draft
      title, status, state, intended RFC category, RFC number, related
      documents, abstract, author names and emails.  Format: HTML.

Internet-Draft       Draft Information Requirements        February 2005


   o  IETF "Internet-Drafts Tracker" [2]: Provides draft name, version,
      status, state, shepherding AD name, modification date, WG name,
      and IESG discussion details.  Format: HTML.

   o  Henrik Levkowetz "Workgroup draft pages" [3]: Provides draft name,
      date, all draft versions, diffs, nits, various draft formats, and
      last call information.  Format: XHTML.

   o  Henrik Levkowetz "Drafts document repositories" [4]: Provides
      draft name, date, all draft versions, diffs, nits, various draft
      formats, and last call information.  Format: XHTML.

   o  Potaroo Internet Drafts
		Repository [5]: Provides draft name,
      date, author names, WG name, abstract.  Includes expired drafts.
      Format: HTML.


6.  Draft information

   The following information must be available about a given draft:

   o  draft identifier (Section 6.1)

   o  draft meta-data (Section 6.2)

   o  available draft versions (Section 6.3)

   o  change history (Section 6.4)

   o  events (Section 6.5)

   In addition to the above information, a "notify me when this draft
   changes" functionality should eventually be supported.  It may also
   be useful to supplement the above data with a pointer to the "IESG
   draft discussion" tracking page, especially for drafts already
   submitted for publication.  Details of these features are outside of
   this document scope.

6.1  Draft identifier

   Draft identifier is a string that uniquely identifies any IETF draft
   regardless of version or status.  At the time of writing, draft name
   can be used as an identifier, but implementations must not rely on
   that being the case.  For example, future implementations may be able
   to keep the same identifier for a draft that changes ownership from
   individual to WG.

Internet-Draft       Draft Information Requirements        February 2005


6.2  Draft metadata

   Draft metadata depends, in part, on draft status and includes the
   following items:

   o  title

   o  authors information

   o  WG name

   o  draft status (Section 6.2.1)

   o  published document information (for published drafts)

   o  email address for draft discussion and comments

   o  "obsoletes X" or "renamed to Y" information

   Draft metadata applies to the draft as a whole rather than specific
   draft version.  Nevertheless, it is based on the latest draft version
   and, hence, may change with draft revisions.  For example, the title
   may be extracted from the latest draft version.

   All draft metadata must be available in format(s) suitable for human
   consumption and in XML format.

   [[XXX3: If we explicitly list title, should we also list abstract?
   Moreover, should we list any fields that are meant-to-be extractable
   from the latest draft version? --Alex]]

6.2.1  Status

   A draft status is either "active", "expired", or "published".  The
   status determines a subset of available draft metadata.  The status
   also affects the availability of draft text and possibility of future
   text revisions.

6.3  Draft versions

   Each draft has at least one draft version associated with it.  Draft
   information includes a list of all draft versions, including the
   expired ones.  This index allows the user to assess draft revision
   activity and to access information specific to any version of a given
   draft (see Section 7).  It also allows to determine the latest draft
   version.

Internet-Draft       Draft Information Requirements        February 2005


6.4  Change history

   Change history provides information about the difference between any
   two versions of a given draft.  That information includes the
   difference in draft version metadata and in draft version content.

   Change history may be precomputed or generated runtime, possibly
   depending on the versions being compared.  For example, the
   implementation may assume that most users would be interested in
   changes between sequential versions and precomputed that while
   providing runtime-generated differences between arbitrary two
   versions.

6.5  Draft events

   Draft events information includes a list of all issued IETF events
   associated with the draft.  This document does not define an IETF
   event interface, but typical entries might include "new draft version
   available" and "WG last call issued".

7.  Draft Version

   For each available draft version, the following information should be
   provided:

   o  version identifier (Section 7.1)

   o  version meta-data (Section 7.2)

   o  primary version format (Section 7.3)

   o  all available version formats (Section 7.4)


7.1  Version identifier

   Draft version identifier is a non-negative integer number that
   uniquely identifies any draft version of a given draft.  Version
   identifier values must increase by one with every new draft version
   posted.

   At the time of writing, draft version number can be used as an
   identifier, but implementations must not rely on that being the case.
   For example, future implementations may be able to keep incrementing
   version identifier when a draft changes ownership from individual to
   WG.

Internet-Draft       Draft Information Requirements        February 2005


7.2  Version metadata

   Draft version includes the following items:

   o  version number

   o  posting date

   o  nits


7.3  Primary version format

7.4  Version formats

8.  Format information

8.1  Format metadata

   Draft version format metadata includes the following items:

   o  format identifier (TXT, HTML, PDF, or PS)

   o  format MIME type

   o  format size

   o  format-specific info (e.g., number of pages for text formats or
      PDF-specific nits)


8.2  Format data

   Draft version format data is the content (a.k.a., "text") of the
   draft version, in the corresponding format.

9.  Email interface

   TBD

10.  Implementation stages

   TBD.

11.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

12.  IANA Considerations

   None.

13.  Compliance

   TBD.

Appendix A.  Comparison with current procedures

   This section summarizes major differences between information
   currently provided by IETF and what is being proposed, including
   violations of the current IETF rules.

   o  Currently, IETF provides only the latest draft version.  This
      document requires providing all unexpired versions.  This change
      allows to maintain a change history useful for draft review and
      discussion.  The change does not seem to contradict written IETF
      rules and principles.  If an experiment with providing unexpired
      but obsolete versions does not cause significant problems, the
      IETF rules might be modified to also provide all draft versions
      for unexpired drafts and, later, all draft versions ever posted.

   version 01

      *  Added missing draft information pieces and claimed that this
         version lists all pieces we want to provide.  Many items still
         lack details.

      *  Separated draft information pieces into draft/version/format
         layers.

      *  Added "Status quo" section: Documented what draft information
         is currently available and listed a few sites providing that
         information.  More popular sites needed.
