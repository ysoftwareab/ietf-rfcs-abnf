              Sieve Email Filtering: delivery by mailboxid
                   draft-gondwana-sieve-mailboxid-00

Abstract

   The OBJECTID capability of the IMAP protocol (I-D.ietf-extra-imap-
   objectid) allows clients to identify mailboxes by a unique identifier
   which survives rename.  In contrast, the Sieve mail filtering
   language (RFC 5228) currently has no such capability.  This memo
   defines a Sieve extension that fills this gap: it adds a method for
   specifying the unique identifier of a mailbox as a target for
   fileinto rules, and a method for testing the existence of a mailbox
   by its unique identifier.

1.  Introduction

   Sieve rules are sometimes created using graphical interfaces which
   allow users to select the mailbox to be used as a target for a rule.
   If that mailbox is renamed, the client may also update its internal
   representation of the rule and update the sieve script to match,
   however this is a multi-step process and subject to partial failures.
   Also, if the folder is renamed by a different mechanism (e.g. another
   IMAP client) the rules will get out of sync.

   By extending "fileinto" to reference an immutable mailboxid, sieve
   rules can continue to target the same mailbox, regardless of how it
   gets renamed.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

   capitals, as shown here.

Internet-Draft               Sieve MAILBOXID                 August 2018


3.  Capability argument

   The server must advertise the capability "mailboxid", and scripts
   which use the following extensions must explicitly request the
   capability "mailboxid".

   Example:

                           require "mailboxid";

4.  Argument ":mailboxid" to Command "fileinto"

   Normally, the positional mailbox argument to a fileinto action
   delivers the message in a mailbox with the matching [RFC3501] name.

   This document adds a new tagged argument ":mailboxid".  If the
   ":mailboxid" argument is provided, the positional mailbox argument
   refers to an [I-D.ietf-extra-imap-objectid] mailboxid rather than an
   [RFC3501] name.

   If there is no mailbox with the specified ":mailboxid" then the
   action is the same as if there was no named mailbox, and
   implementations are free to make the same choices given in [RFC5228]
   Section 4.1 when the specified mailbox doesn't exist.

   The tagged argument ":mailboxid" to fileinto consumes zero additional
   tokens.

   Example:

       require "fileinto";
       require "mailboxid";

       if header :contains ["from"] "coyote" {
           fileinto :mailboxid "F6352ae03-b7f5-463c-896f-d8b48ee3";
       }

5.  Test ":mailboxidexists"

   This test behaves identically to the "mailboxexists" test defined in
   [RFC5490] but operates on mailboxids rather than mailbox names.

   Usage: "mailboxidexists <mailboxids: string-list>"

   The "mailboxidexists" test is true if all mailboxes listed in the
   "mailboxids" argument exist in the mailstore, and each allows the
   user in whose context the Sieve script runs to "deliver" messages

Internet-Draft               Sieve MAILBOXID                 August 2018


   into it.  When the mailstore is an IMAP server, "delivery" of
   messages is possible if:

   a) the READ-WRITE response code is present for the mailbox (see
   Section 7.1 of [RFC3501]), if IMAP Access Control List (ACL)
   [RFC4314] is not supported by the server, or

   b) the user has 'p' or 'i' rights for the mailbox (see Section 5.2 of
   [RFC4314]).

   Note that a successful "mailboxidexists" test for a mailbox doesn't
   necessarily mean that a "fileinto :mailboxid" action on this mailbox
   would succeed.  For example, the "fileinto" action might put user
   over quota.  The "mailboxidexists" only verifies existence of the
   mailbox and whether the user in whose context the Sieve script runs
   has permissions to execute "fileinto" on it.

   Example:

     require "fileinto";
     require "mailboxid";

     if header :contains ["from"] "coyote" {
         if mailboxidexists "F6352ae03-b7f5-463c-896f-d8b48ee3" {
             fileinto :mailboxid "F6352ae03-b7f5-463c-896f-d8b48ee3";
         } else {
             fileinto "INBOX.harassment";
         }
     }

6.  Formal Syntax

                  test /= ":mailboxidexists" string-list

                  tag /= ":mailboxid"

7.  Security considerations

   This document does not add any security considerations beyond those
   in [RFC5228], [RFC5490] and [I-D.ietf-extra-imap-objectid].
   Implementers are referred to the security considerations sections of
   those documents.

8.  IANA considerations

   IANA are requested to add a capability to the sieve-extensions
   registry:

   To: iana@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of new Sieve extension

   Capability name: mailboxid
   Description: adds test for checking for mailbox existence by objectid
                and a new optional argument to fileinto to select the
                destination mailbox using objectid.

9.  Acknowledgements

   This document borrows heavily from [RFC5490] for the matching
   mailboxexists test, and from [I-D.ietf-extra-sieve-special-use] for
   an example of modifying the fileinto command.

10.  TODO

   Is there a more explicit way to update the grammar?  It seems less
   fully specified than IMAP.
