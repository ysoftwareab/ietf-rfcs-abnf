    Abstract 

       In the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), the Mobile Node (MN) is 
       assigned a 64-bit Home Network Prefix (HNP) during the initial 
       attachment for the Home Address (HoA) configuration. During the 
       movements of MN, this prefix is unchanged and then it's unnecessary 
       for the MN to reconfigure the HoA. In this way, the handover is 
       transparent at the IP and above layers of the MN. However, the 
       current protocol does not specify the related operation to support 
       the MN to timely receive the new HNP and configure the new HoA when 
       its allocated HNP changes. In this draft, this problem is discussed 
       and a possible solution is proposed based on some simple extensions 
       of the basic PMIPv6.

      1. Introduction 

       Network managers currently prefer to Provider Independent (PI) 
       addressing for IPv6 to attempt to minimize the need for future 
       renumbering. However, widespread use of PI may create very serious 
       BGP scaling problems. It is thus desirable to develop tools and 
       practices that may make renumbering a simpler process to reduce 
       demand for IPv6 PI space [1]. In this draft, we aims to solve the 
       HNP renumbering problem when the HNP in PMIPv6 [2] is not a PI type. 

       Then the HNP renumbering may happen at least in the following three 
       cases: 



     
     
    Yan et al.              Expires January,2015                  [Page 2] 
        
    Internet-Draft        HNP Renumbering in PMIPv6           July 1, 2014 
     

       In the first case, the PMIPv6 service provider is assigned the HNP 
       set from the (uplink) ISP, and then the HNP renumbering will happen 
       if the PMIPv6 service provider switches to a different ISP.  

       In the second case, multiple Local Mobility Anchors (LMAs) may be 
       deployed by the same PMIPv6 service provider, and then each LMA may 
       serve for a special HNP set. In this case, the HNP of a MN may 
       change if the current serving LMA switches to other LMA but without 
       inheriting the assigned HNP [3].  

       In the last case, the PMIPv6 HNP renumbering may be caused by the 
       re-building of the network architecture as the companies split, 
       merge, grow, relocate or reorganize. For example, the PMIPv6 service 
       provider may reorganize its network topology.  

       For the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6), when the home network prefix changes 
       (maybe due to the above reasons), the Home Agent (HA) will actively 
       notify the new prefix to the MN and then the renumbering of the HoA 
       can be well supported [4]. While in the basic PMIPv6, the PMIPv6 
       binding is triggered by the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG), which 
       detects the attachment of the MN. When the HNP renumbering happens 
       in the first case or the LMA and HNP both changes in the second or 
       third cases, a scheme is needed for the LMA to immediately initiate 
       the PMIPv6 binding state refreshment. Although this issue is also 
       discussed in the RFC 5213 (section 6.12), the related solution is 
       not specified. 

      2. HNP renumbering support 

       The basic operation is summarized as follows: 

       1) When the PMIPv6 service provider renumbers the HNP set or the 
       serving LMA switches to another one but does not inherit the related 
       HNP, the current LMA (or new LMA) will initiate the HNP renumbering 
       operation. Firstly, it should allocate a new HNP for the related MN. 

       2) The LMA sends a Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message to the MAG. In 
       the PBU message, the HNP option containing the new HNP and the 
       Mobile Node Identifier option carrying MN'ID is contained. 

       3) After the MAG receives this PBU message, it will recognize that 
       the related MN has a new HNP now. Then the MAG sends the old HNP in 
       the RA with zero-valued lifetime to the MN and sends the new HNP in 
       the RA with lifetime larger than zero.

    Internet-Draft        HNP Renumbering in PMIPv6           July 1, 2014 
     

       4) Besides, the MAG sends back the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement 
       (PBA) to the LMA for the notification of successful update of 
       binding state, routing state and RA settings. 

       5) For the MN, it deletes the old HoA due to the zero-valued 
       lifetime RA advertisement and configures a new HoA with the 
       meaningful HNP. 

       The detailed protocol operation and signaling message extensions 
       will be specified further. 

      3. DNS update 

       In order to maintain the reachability of the MN, the DNS resource 
       record corresponding to this MN may need to be updated when the HNP 
       of MN changes. Although this operation in PMIPv6 has not been 
       specified by the current protocols, we here list two important 
       issues to be considered for this operation.  

       1) Since the DNS update must be performed securely in order to 
       prevent attacks or modifications from malicious nodes, the node 
       performing this update must share a security association with the 
       DNS server [5]. If the MN does not share a security association with 
       the DNS server and the DNS entry update can be performed by the 
       network entities, such as Authentication, Authorization and 
       Accounting (AAA) server or LMA.  

       2) For the dynamic update, another important issue should be 
       considered is the TTL (Time To Live) setting when the HNP 
       renumbering is possible. The TTL should be set according to the 
       possible lifetime of the HNP. 

      4. Security Considerations 

       The security considerations in PMIPv6 protocol are enough for the 
       basic operation of this draft. 

       Besides, the security dynamic DNS should be supported whatever the 
       DNS update is executed by network entities or MN itself. In other 
       words, the security association should always be established between 
       the DNS server and updater. 

       Other security issues will be added further.
