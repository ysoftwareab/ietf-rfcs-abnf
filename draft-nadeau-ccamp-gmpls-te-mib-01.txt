   -  Update examples and provide more detail.


1.2.  Pending Work
   
   The following work items have been identified for this
   draft.  They will be addressed in a future version.
   
   -  Clarify which objects can be modified when rowStatus
      and adminStatus are set to active
   
   -  Expand conformance statements to give one for
      monitoring only, and one for monitoring and control.
   
   -  Bring references up to date, include all drafts
      referenced from this document, and exclude those that
      are not referenced.
   
   -  Provide objects or tables to support getNextIndex for
      all arbitrary indexes.

   -  Update enumerated types in line with latest GMPLS
   drafts.
   
   -  Resolve ownership of enumerated types that are also
      defined in GMPLS or routing drafts.  (See "Ed Note:"
      in text.)  These could be owned by IANA, imported from
      another MIB, or manually kept in step here.  If they
      are not maintained externally then they are likely to
      diverge and MIB implementations will need to provide
      mappings.


2. Introduction
   
   This memo defines an experimental portion of the
   Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network
   management protocols in the Internet community.  In
   particular, it describes managed objects for
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) [RFC3031] and
   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
   [GMPLSArch] based traffic engineering.
   
   Comments should be made directly to the CCAMP mailing
   list at ccamp@ops.ietf.org.
   
   This memo does not, in its draft form, specify a standard
   for the Internet community.


2.1.  Migration Strategy
   
   This MIB is built upon the traffic engineering MIB
   defined for use with MPLS [TEMIB]. The only changes made
   are additions for support of GMPLS or changes that are
   necessary to support the increased complexity of a GMPLS
   system.
   
   In all cases, these changes have been made such that
   migration from [TEMIB] to this MIB will be as simple as
   possible.
   
   Note that this MIB may be used in systems that support
   MPLS, GMPLS or both.
   
   This MIB may be seen as a replacement for the MPLS TE MIB
   [TEMIB] in systems which support GMPLS, but it is not a
   requirement that it replace the MPLS TE MIB in systems
   that only support MPLS.
   
   The companion document modeling and managing GMPLS based

   LSRs [GMPLSLSRMIB] is based on the MPLS LSR MIB [LSRMIB]
   with the same intentions.  It is not expected that a
   system would mix MPLS and GMPLS MIBs.
   
   Textual conventions and OBJECT-IDENTIFIERS are defined in
   [GMPLSTCMIB] which extends the set of textual conventions
   defined in [TCMIB].
   
   See section 11.1 for a description of how the
   gmplsLabelTable may be omitted in systems that support
   MPLS only.


3. Terminology
   
   This document uses terminology from the MPLS architecture
   document [RFC3031] and GMPLS Label Switching Router MIB
   [GMPLSLSRMIB].  It imports constructs from the GMPLS
   textual conventions MIB [GMPLSTCMIB] and from the MPLS
   textual conventions MIB [TCMIB].  Some frequently used
   terms are described next.
   
   An explicitly routed LSP (ERLSP) is referred to as an
   MPLS tunnel.  It consists of one in-segment and/or one
   out-segment at the ingress/egress LSRs, each segment
   being associated with one MPLS interface.  These are also
   referred to as tunnel segments.
   
   Additionally, at an intermediate LSR, we model a
   connection as consisting of one or more in-segments
   and/or one or more out-segments.  The binding or
   interconnection between in-segments and out-segments in
   performed using a cross-connect.  These objects are
   defined in the GMPLS Label Switching Router MIB
   [GMPLSLSRMIB].


4. The SNMP Management Framework
   
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five
   major components:
   
   -  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571
   [RFC2571].
   
   -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and
      events for the purpose of management.  The first
      version of this Structure of Management Information
      (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC
      1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC



Nadeau et al.                Expires July 2002               [Page 5]

Internet Draft                GMPLS TE MIB               January 2002



      1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is
      described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC
      2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].
   
   -  Message protocols for transferring management
      information.  The first version of the SNMP message
      protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC
      1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the SNMP message
      protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
      [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version
      of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described
      in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574
      [RFC2574].
   
   -  Protocol operations for accessing management
      information.  The first set of protocol operations and
      associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC
      1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol operations
      and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [RFC1905].
   
   -  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC
      2573 [RFC2573] and the view-based access control
      mechanism described in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].
   
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP
   Management Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
   store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms
   defined in the SMI.
   
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the
   SMIv2.  A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced
   through the appropriate translations.  The resulting
   translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except
   where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine
   readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into
   textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation
   process.
   
   However, this loss of machine readable information is not
   considered to change the semantics of the MIB.


5. Feature List



Nadeau et al.                Expires July 2002               [Page 6]

Internet Draft                GMPLS TE MIB               January 2002



   
   The GMPLS traffic engineering MIB is designed to satisfy
   the following requirements and constraints.
   
   -  The MIB supports MPLS and GMPLS tunnels.
   
   -  The MIB supports configuration of point-to-point
      unidirectional and bidirectional tunnels.
   
   -  Tunnels need not be interfaces, but it is possible to
      configure a tunnel as an interface.
   
   -  The MIB supports manually configured tunnels as well as
     those set up via an MPLS or GMPLS signaling protocol.
   
   -  The MIB supports persistent as well as non-persistent
   tunnels.


6. Outline
   
   Support for MPLS or GMPLS traffic-engineered tunnels
   requires the following configuration.
   
   -  Setting up tunnels along with appropriate MPLS or
      GMPLSconfiguration parameters.
   
   -  Configuring tunnel loose and strict source routed
   hops.
   
   These actions may need to be accompanied with
   corresponding actions using [GMPLSLSRMIB] to establish
   and configure tunnel segments, if this is done manually.
   Also, the in-segment and out-segment performance tables,
   mplsInSegmentPerfTable and mplsOutSegmentPerfTable
   [GMPLSLSRMIB], should be used to determine performance of
   the tunnels and tunnel segments.


6.1.  Summary of GMPLS Traffic Engineering MIB
   
   The MIB objects for performing these actions consist of
   the following tables.
   
   -  Tunnel Table (gmplsTunnelTable) for setting up MPLS or
      GMPLS tunnels.
   
   -  Resource table (gmplsTunnelResourceTable) for setting
      up the tunnel resources.

Internet Draft                GMPLS TE MIB               January 2002



   -  Tunnel specified, actual, and computed hop tables
      (gmplsTunnelHopTable, gmplsTunnelARHopTable, and
      gmplsTunnelCHopTable) for strict and loose source
      routed tunnel hops.
   
   -  CRLDP resource table (gmplsTunnelCRLDPResTable) for
      specifying resource objects applicable only to tunnels
      signaled using CRLDP.
   
   -  Performance and error reporting tables
      (gmplsTunnelPerfTable and gmplsTunnelErrorTable).
   
   These tables are described in the subsequent sections.


7. Brief Description of MIB Objects
   
   The objects described in this section support the
   functionality described in documents [RSVPTE] and [CRLDP]
   for MPLS tunnels and the functionality described in
   [GMPLSRSVPTE] and [GMPLSCRLDP] for GMPLS tunnels.
   
   The tables support both manually configured and signaled
   tunnels.


7.1.  gmplsTunnelTable
   
   The gmplsTunnelTable allows new MPLS and GMPLS tunnels to
   be created between an LSR and a remote endpoint, and
   existing tunnels to be reconfigured or removed.  Note
   that we only support point-to-point tunnel segments,
   although multi-point-to-point and point-to-multi-point
   connections are supported by an LSR acting as a cross-
   connect.
   
   Each tunnel can thus have one out-segment originating at
   an LSR and/or one in-segment terminating at that LSR.
   
   gmplsTunnelTable does not define the in and out segments
   forming the tunnel.  Instead, these are defined by
   creating rows in the in-segment and out-segment tables,
   defining relationships in the cross-connect table and
   referring to these rows in the gmplsTunnelTable using a
   cross-connect index, gmplsTunnelXCIndex.
   
   These segment and cross-connect related objects are
   defined in [GMPLSLSRMIB].
   
   The gmplsTunnelTable is indexed by two arbitrary indexes



Nadeau et al.                Expires July 2002               [Page 8]

Internet Draft                GMPLS TE MIB               January 2002



   (and some other indexes).  The next available value for
   the primary index (gmplsTunnelIndex) can be found by
   reading the gmplsNextIndex object.  For any specific set
   of values of the primary indexes (gmplsTunnelIndex,
   gmplsTunnelIngressLSRId and gmplsTunnelEgressLSRId) the
   next value of the secondary index (gmplsTunnelInstance)
   can be found by reading the gmplsTunnelInstanceNextTable
   entry with the same primary indexes.


7.2.  gmplsTunnelResourceTable
   
   The gmplsTunnelResourceTable is used to indicate the
   resources required for a tunnel.  Multiple tunnels may
   share the same resources by pointing to the same entry in
   this table.  Tunnels that do not share resources must
   point to separate entries in this table.


7.3.  gmplsTunnelHopTable
   
   The gmplsTunnelHopTable is used to indicate the hops,
   strict or loose, for an MPLS or GMPLS tunnel defined in
   gmplsTunnelTable, when it is established using signaling.
   Multiple tunnels may share the same hops by pointing to
   the same entry in this table.  Each row also has a
   secondary index, gmplsTunnelHopIndex, corresponding to
   the next hop of this tunnel.  The scalar
   mplsTunnelMaxHops indicates the maximum number of hops
   that can be specified on each tunnel supported by this
   LSR.

7.3.1 Determining next entries in gmplsTunnelHopTable
   
   Two tables (gmplsTunnelHopPathOptionIndexNextTable and
   gmplsTunnelHopIndexNextTable) can be used in association
   with a scalar (gmplsTunnelHopListIndexNext) to determine
   the next available indexing values in the
   gmplsTunnelHopTable.


7.4.  gmplsTunnelARHopTable
   
   The gmplsTunnelARHopTable is used to indicate the actual
   hops traversed by a tunnel as reported by the signaling
   protocol after the tunnel is setup.  The support of this
   table is optional since not all MPLS/GMPLS signaling
   protocols support this feature.

Internet Draft                GMPLS TE MIB               January 2002



7.5.  gmplsTunnelCHoptable
   
   The gmplsTunnelCHopTable lists the actual hops computed
   by a constraint-based routing algorithm based on the
   gmplsTunnelHopTable.
   
   The support of this table is optional since not all
   implementations support computation of hop list using a
   constraint-based routing protocol.


7.6.  gmplsTunnelPerfTable
   
   gmplsTunnelPerfTable provides several counters to measure
   the performance of the MPLS and GMPLS tunnels.  This
   table augments gmplsTunnelTable.
   
   Note that not all counters may be appropriate or
   available for some types of tunnel.


7.7.  gmplsTunnelErrorTable
   
   The gmplsTunnelErrorTable provides access to information
   about the last error that occurred on each tunnel known
   about by the MIB.  It indicates the nature of the error,
   when and how it was reported and can give recovery advice
   through a display string. gmplsTunnelCRLDPResTable
   
   The gmplsTunnelCRLDPResTable contains additional resource
   information for those tunnels that are signaled using
   CRLDP [CRLDP].  This is a sparse extension to
   mplsTunnelResourceTable and is also indexed by
   gmplsTunnelResourceIndex.  As with
   gmplsTunnelResourceTable, multiple tunnels may share the
   same resources by pointing to the same entry in this
   table.  Tunnels that do not share resources must point to
   separate entries in this table.


8. Support of Interface Table for MPLS and GMPLS Tunnels
   
   This memo contains media-specific extensions to the
   Interfaces Group for managing MPLS and GMPLS Tunnels as
   logical interfaces and  assumes the interpretation of the
   Interfaces Group to be in accordance with [RFC2863] which
   states that the interfaces table (ifTable) contains
   information on the managed resource's interfaces and that
   each sub-layer below the internetwork layer of a network
   interface is considered an interface.  Thus, the MPLS



Nadeau et al.               Expires July 2002               [Page 10]

Internet Draft                GMPLS TE MIB               January 2002



   interface is represented as an entry in the ifTable (from
   this perspective, MPLS and GMPLS should be considered to
   operate at the MPLS interface).
   
   The interrelation of entries in the ifTable is defined by
   the Interfaces Stack Group defined in [RFC2863].
   
   MPLS and GMPLS tunnels may themselves be used as
   interfaces.  When using tunnels as interfaces, the
   interface stack table might appear as follows:
   
     +------------------------------------------------+
     | MPLS tunnel interface ifType = mplsTunnel(150) |
     +------------------------------------------------+
     |  MPLS interface ifType = mpls(166)             |
     +------------------------------------------------+
   
     |   Underlying layer                             |
     +------------------------------------------------+
   
   In the above diagram, "Underlying Layer" refers to the
   ifIndex of any interface type, which has been defined for
   MPLS interworking.  Examples include ATM, Frame Relay,
   and Ethernet.


8.1.  Support of the MPLS Tunnel Interface by ifTable

11.   The Use of RowPointer and Other Cross-References


11.1. RowPointer
   
   RowPointer is a textual convention used to identify a
   conceptual row in an SNMP Table by pointing to one of its
   objects.  In this MIB, in gmplsTunnelTable, the objects
   gmplsTunnelXCPointer and gmplsTunnelResourcePointer are
   of type RowPointer.  The object gmplsTunnelXCPointer
   points to a specific entry in the gmplsXCTable
   [GMPLSLSRMIB].  This entry in the gmplsXCTable is the
   associated LSP for the given tunnel entry.  The object
   gmplsTunnelResourcePointer points to a specific entry in
   a traffic parameter table.  An example of such a traffic

Internet Draft                GMPLS TE MIB               January 2002



   parameter table is gmplsTunnelResourceTable.  It
   indicates a specific instance of a traffic parameter
   entry that is associated with a given tunnel entry.


11.2. Cross-referencing to the gmplsLabelTable
   
   The gmplsLabelTable [GMPLSLABELMIB] provides a way to
   model labels in a GMPLS system where labels might not be
   simple 32 bit integers.
   
   The hop tables in this document (gmplsHopTable,
   gmplsCHopTable and gmplsARHopTable) use arbitrary indexes
   to point to entries in the gmplsLabelTable to indicate
   specific label values.
   
   Since the primary index into gmplsLabelTabel is a simple
   32 bit integer (gmplsLabelIndex),  in systems where the
   nature of a label is well-known, and where the label can
   safely be encoded as a 32 bit integer (for example a
   conventional MPLS system), the gmplsLabelTable does not
   need to be supported and the pointers to the
   gmplsLabelTable (gmplsTunnelHopExplicitLabel,
   gmplsTunnelHopExplicitReverseLabel,
   gmplsTunnelCHopExplicitLabel,
   gmplsTunnelCHopExplicitReverseLabel,
   gmplsTunnelARHopExplicitLabel,
   gmplsTunnelARHopExplicitReverseLabel) may be replaced
   with the direct label values.
   
   This provides both a good way to support legacy systems
   that implement the previous version of this MIB [TEMIB],
   and a significant simplification in GMPLS systems that
   are limited to a single, simple label type.
   
   Note that gmplsLabelTable supports concatenated labels
   through the use of a sub-label index
   (gmplsSublabelIndex).

13.   Security Considerations
   
   There are a number of management objects defined in this
   MIB that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or



Nadeau et al.               Expires July 2002               [Page 95]

Internet Draft                GMPLS TE MIB               January 2002



   read-create. Such objects may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  The support for
   SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network
   operations.
   
   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that
   may contain information that may be sensitive from a
   business perspective, in that they represent a customer's
   interface to the MPLS network.
   
   Allowing uncontrolled access to these objects could
   result in malicious and unwanted disruptions of network
   traffic or incorrect configurations for these customers.
   There are no objects that are particularly sensitive in
   their own right, such as passwords or monetary amounts.
   
   It is thus important to control even GET access to these
   objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these
   object when sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not
   all versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure
   environment.
   
   At this writing, no security holes have been identified
   beyond those that SNMP Security [SNMPArch] is itself
   intended to address.  These relate to primarily
   controlled access to sensitive information and the
   ability to configure a device - or which might result
   from operator error, which is beyond the scope of any
   security architecture.
   
   SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 are by themselves not a secure
   environment.  Even if the network itself is secure (for
   example by using IPSec [IPSEC]), there is no control as
   to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB. It is recommended that the implementers consider the
   security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
   Specifically, the use of the User-based Security Model
   [SNMPv3USM] and the View-based Access Control
   [SNMPv3VACM] is recommended. It is then a customer/user
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving
   access to an instance of this MIB is properly configured
   to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
