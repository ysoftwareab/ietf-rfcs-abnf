Abstract

   Some LLN subnets are expected to scale up to the thousands of nodes
   and hundreds of routers.  This paper proposes an IPv6 version of the
   Backbone Router concept that enables such a degree of scalability
   using a high speed network as a backbone to the subnet.

Internet-Draft           6LoWPAN Backbone Router               June 2010


1.  Introduction

   The ISA100.11a standard has introduced the concept of a Backbone
   Router that would interconnect small LLNs over a high speed transit
   network and scale a single ISA100.11a network up to the thousands of
   nodes.  In that model the LLNs and the backbone form a single subnet
   in which nodes can move freely without the need of renumbering, and
   the Backbone Router is a special kind of Border Router designed to
   manage the interaction between the LLNs and the backbone at layer 3.
   Similar scalability requirements exist in the metering and monitoring
   industries.  In a network that large, it is impossible for a node to
   register to all Border Routers as suggested for smaller topologies in
   Neighbor Discovery Optimization for Low-power and Lossy Networks
   [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd].

   This paper specifies IP layer functionalities that are required to
   implement the concept of a Backbone Router with IPv6, in particular
   the application of the "IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"
   [RFC4291], " the Neighbor Discovery Protocol" [RFC4861] and "IPv6
   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration" [RFC4862].

   The use of EUI-64 based link local addresses, Neighbor Discovery
   Proxying [RFC4389], Neighbor Discovery Optimization  for Low-power
   and Lossy Networks [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd], the IPv6 Routing Protocol
   for Low power and Lossy Networks [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] and Optimistic
   Duplicate Address Detection [RFC4429] are discussed.  Also, the
   concept of Transit Link is introduced to implement the backbone
   network that was envisioned by ISA100.11a.

   This operation of the Backbone Router requires that some protocol
   operates over the LLNs from which node registrations can be obtained,
   and that can disseminate the location of the backbone Router over the
   LLN.  Further expectations will be detailed.

   The way the PAN IDs and 16-bit short addresses are allocated and
   distributed in the case of an 802.15.4 network is not covered by this
   specification.  Similarly, the aspects of joining and securing the
   network are out of scope.  The way the nodes in the LLN learn about
   their Backbone Router depends on the protocol used in the LLN.  In
   the case of RPL, a Border Router is the root of the DODAG that it
   serves and represents all nodes attached to that DODAG.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Readers are expected to be familiar with all the terms and concepts
   that are discussed in "Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6"
   [RFC4861], "IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration" [RFC4862],
   "IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs):
   Overview, Assumptions, Problem Statement, and Goals" [RFC4919],
   Neighbor Discovery Optimization  for Low-power and Lossy Networks
   [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd] and "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE
   802.15.4 Networks" [RFC4944].

   Readers would benefit from reading "Mobility Support in IPv6"
   [RFC3775], "Neighbor Discovery Proxies (ND Proxy)" [RFC4389] and
   "Optimistic Duplicate Address Detection" [RFC4429] prior to this
   specification for a clear understanding of the art in ND-proxying and
   binding.

   Additionally, this document uses terminology from
   [I-D.ietf-roll-terminology], and introduces the following
   terminology:

   Backbone

         This is an IPv6 transit link that interconnects 2 or more
         Backbone Routers.  It is expected to be deployed as a high
         speed backbone in order to federate a potentially large set of
         LLNS.  Also referred to as a LLN backbone or transit network.

   Backbone Router

         An IPv6 router that federates the LLN using a transit link as a
         backbone.

   Extended LLN

         This is the aggregation of multiple LLNs as defined in
         [RFC4919] interconnected by a Transit Link via Backbone Routers
         and forming a single IPv6 link.

         The BR that will defend a registered address for the purpose of
         DAD over the backbone

         A BR to which the address is registered.  A Secondary Router
         MAY advertise the address over the backbone and proxy for it.

3.  Overview

   A Transit Link that we'll refer to a the LLN Backbone federates
   multiple LLNs as a single IP subnet.  Each LLN in the subnet is
   anchored at a Backbone Router.  The Backbone Routers interconnect the
   LLNs over that Backbone Link.  A node can move freely from a LLN
   anchored at a Backbone Router to a LLN anchored at another Backbone
   Router on the same backbone and conserve its link local and any other
   IPv6 address it has formed.

               Figure 1: Backbone Link and Backbone Routers

   The Backbone Link is used as reference for Neighbor Discovery
   operations, by extending the concept of a Home Link as defined in
   [RFC3775] for Mobile IPv6.  In particular, Backbone Routers perform
   ND proxying for the LLN nodes in the LLNs they own through a node
   registration.

   The Backbone Router operation is compatible with that of a Home
   Agent.  This enables mobility support for LLN devices that would move
   outside of the network delimited by the transit link.  This also
   enables collocation of Home Agent functionality within Backbone
   Router functionality on the same interface of a router.

   A LLN node registers and claims ownership of its addresse(s) using
   proactive acknowledged registration exchanges with a neighboring
   router.  In case of a complex LLN topology, the router might be an
   intermediate LLN Router that relays the registration to the LBR as
   described for instance in [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd] and
   [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].  In turn, the Backbone Routers operate as a
   distributed database of all the LLN nodes and use the Neighbor
   Discovery Protocol to share that information across the transit link
   in a reactive fashion.

   For the purpose of Neighbor Discovery proxying, this specification
   documents the LLN Master Neighbor Registry, a conceptual data
   structure that is similar to the MIP6 binding cache.  The Master
   Neighbor Registry is fed by redistributing addresses learnt from the
   registration protocol used over the LLN.

   Another function of the Backbone Router is to perform 6LoWPAN
   compression and expansion between the LLN and the Transit Link and
   ensure MTU compatibility.  Packets flow uncompressed over the Transit
   Link and are routed normally towards a Gateway or an Application
   sitting on the transit link or on a different link that is reachable
   over the IP network.

4.  New types and formats

   The specification expects that the protocol running on the LLN can
   provide a sequence number called Transaction ID (TID) that is
   associated to the registration.  When a node registers to multiple
   BRs, it is expected that the same TID is used, to enable the BR to
   correlate the registrations as being a single one, and differentiate
   that situation from a movement.  Otherwise, the resolution makes it
   so that only the most recent registration was perceived from the
   highest TID is kept.

   The specification expects that the protocol running on the LLN can
   provide a unique ID for the owner of the address that is being
   registered.  The Owner Unique ID enables to differentiate a duplicate
   registration from a double registration.  In case of a duplicate, the
   last registration looses.  The Owner Unique ID can be as simple as a
   EUI-64 burnin address, if the device manufacturor is convinced that
   there can not be a manuf error that would cause duplicate EUI64
   addresses.  Alternatively, the unique ID can be a hash of supposedly
   unique information from multiple orthogonal sources, for instance:

   o  Burn in address.

   o  configured address, id, security keys...

   o  (pseudo) Random number, radio link metrics ...

   In any fashion, it is recommended that the device stores the unique
   Id in persistent memory.  Otherwise, it will be prevented to
   reregister after a reboot that would cause a loss of memory until the
   Backbone Router times out the registration.

   The unique ID and the sequence number are placed in a new ND option
   that is used by the Backbone Routers over the transit link to detect
   duplicates and movements.  The option format is as follows:

4.1.  Binding Tracking Option

   This option is designed to be used with standard NS and NA messages
   between backbone Routers over a backbone link and may be used between
   LRs and LBRs over the LLN.  By using this option, the binding in
   question can be uniquely identified and matched with the Master
   Neighbor Registry entries of each Backbone Router.

5.  Backbone Router Operations

5.1.  Backbone Link and Router

   The Backbone Router is a specific kind of Border Router that performs
   proxy Neighbor Discovery on its backbone interface on behalf of the
   nodes that it has discovered on its Low Power Lossy Network
   interfaces.  On the LLN side, the Backbone Router acquires its states
   about the nodes by terminating protocols such as RPL
   [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] or 6LoWPAN ND [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd] as a LLN
   Border Router.  It is expected that the backbone is the medium used
   to connect the subnet to the rest of the infrastructure, and that all
   the LBRs are connected to that backbone and support the Backbone
   Router feature as specified in this document.

   The backbone is expected to be a high speed, reliable transit link,
   with affordable multicast capabilities, such as an Ethernet Network
   or a fully meshed NBMA network with multicast emulation, which allows
   a full support of classical ND as specified in [RFC4861] and
   subsequent RFCs.  In other words, the backbone is not a LLN.  Still,
   some restrictions of the attached LLNs will apply to the backbone.
   In particular, it is expected that the MTU is set to the same value
   on the backbone and all attached LLNs.

5.2.  ND Proxy Operations

   This specification enables a Backbone Router to proxy Neighbor
   Discovery operations over the backbone on behalf of the nodes that
   are registered to it, allowing any device on the backbone to reach a
   LLN node as if it was on-link.

   In the context of this specification, proxy ND means:

   o  defending a registered address over the backbone using NA messages
      with the Override bit set

   o  advertising a registered address over the backbone using NA
      messages, asynchronously or as a response to a Neighbor
      Solicitation messages.

   o  Looking up a destination over the backbone in order to deliver
      packets arriving from the LLN using Neighbor Sollicitation
      messages.

   o  Forwarding packets from the LLN over the backkbone, and hte other
      way around.

Internet-Draft           6LoWPAN Backbone Router               June 2010


   o  Eventually triggering a look up for a destination over the LLN
      that would not be registered at a given point of time, or as a
      verification of a registration.

   The draft introduces the concept of primary and secondary BRs.  The
   concept is defined with the granularity of an address, that is a
   given BR can be primary for a given address and secondary or another
   one, regardess on whether the addresses belong to the same node or
   not.  The primary Backbone Router is in charge of protecting the
   address for DAD over the Backbone.  Any of the Primary and Secondary
   BR may claim the address over the backbone, since they are all
   capable to route from the backbone to the LLN device.

   When the protocol used to register the nodes over the LLN is RPL
   [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl], it is expected that one BR acts as virtual root
   coordinating LLN BRs (with the same DODAGID) over the non-LLN
   backbone.  In that case, the virtual root may act as primary BR for
   all addresses that it cares to support, whereas the physical roots to
   which the node is attached are secondary BRs.  It is also possible in
   a given deployment that the DODAGs are not coordinated.  In that
   case, there is no virtual root and no secondary BR; the DODAG root is
   primary all the nodes registered to it over the backbone.

   When the protocol used to register the nodes over the LLN is 6LoWPAN
   ND [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd], the Backbone Routers act as a distributed
   DAD table, using classical ND over the backbone to detect
   duplication.  This specification requires that:

   1.  Registrations for all addresses that can be required to reach the
       device over the backbone, including registrations for IPv6
       addresses based on burn-in EUI64 addresses are passed to the DAD
       table.

   2.  Nodes include the Binding Tracking Option in their NS used for
       registering those addresses and the LRs propagate that option to
       the LBRs.

   A false positive duplicate detection may arise over the backbone, for
   instance if the node registers to more than one LBR, or if the node
   has moved.  Both situations are handled gracefully unbeknownst to the
   node.  In the former case, one LBR becomes primary to defend the
   address over the backbone while the others become secondary and may
   still forward packets back and forth.  In the latter case the LBR
   that receives the newest registration wins and becomes primary.

5.3.  Claiming and defending

   Upon a new or an updated registration, the BR performs a DAD
   operation.  If either a TID or a OUI is available, the BR places them
   in a Binding Tracking Option in all its ND messages over the
   backbone.  If content is not available for a given field, it is set
   to 0.

   If a primary already exists over the backbone, it will answer the DAD
   with an RA.

   o  If a RA is received with the O bit set, the primary rejects the
      DAD and the DAD fails. the BR needs to inform the LLN protocol
      that the address is a duplicate.

   o  If a RA is received with the O bit reset, the primary accepts the
      BR as secondary and DAD succeeds.  The BR may install or maintain
      its proxy states for that address.  This router MAY advertise the
      address using a NA. during a registration flow, it MAY set the O
      bit.

   o  If no RA is received, this router assumes the role of primary and
      DAD succeeds.  The BR may install or maintain its proxy states for
      that address.  This router advertises the address using a NA with
      the O bit reset.

   When the BR installs or maintains its proxy states for an address, it
   sends an NA with a SLLA option for that address.  The Primary BR MAY
   set the O bit if it wished to attract the traffic for that address.

5.4.  Conflict Resolution

   A conflict arise when multiple BRs get a registration from a same
   address.  This situation might arise when a node moves from a BR to
   another, when a node registers to multiple BRs, or in the RPL case
   when the BRs belong to a single coordinated DODAG.

   The primary looks up the Binding Tracking Option in ND messages with
   a SLLA option.

   o  If there is no option, normal ND operation takes place and the
      primary defends the address with a NA with the O bit set, adding
      the Binding Tracking Option with its own information.

   o  If there is a Binding Tracking Option and the OUIs are different,
      then the conflict apparently happens between different nodes, and
      the the primary defends the address with a NA with the O bit set,
      adding the Binding Tracking Option with its own information.  If

      the TID in the Binding Tracking Option is in the straight part of
      the lollipop, it is possible that the request comes from the same
      node that has rebooted and formed a new OUI The primary BR may
      assess its registered entry prior to answering.

   o  If there is a Binding Tracking Option and the OUIs are the same:

      *  If the TID in the ND message is newer than the most recent one
         known by the primary router, this is interpreted as a node
         moving.  The primary cleans up its states and stops defending
         the address.

      *  If the TID in the ND message is the same as the most recent one
         known by the primary router, this is interpreted as a double
         registration.  In case of a DAD, the promary responds with a NA
         with the O bit reset, to confirm its position as primary,
         including the Binding Tracking Option.

      *  If the TID in the ND message is older than the most recent one
         known by the primary router, this is interpreted as a stale
         information.  The primary defends the address with a NA with
         the O bit set, adding the Binding Tracking Option with its own
         information.

      *  If the TIDs are very different (more than 16 apart, discounting
         the straight part of the lollipop), it is impossible to resolve
         for sure.  The primary BR should assess its registered entry
         prior to answering.

5.5.  Assessing an entry

   In a number of cases, it might happen that the information at the
   primary BR is stale and obsolete.  In particular, a node with no
   permanent storage might reboot and form a different OUI, in which
   case the information at the BR is inaccurate and should be removed.
   In another case, the Br and the node have been out of reach for too
   long and the TID that the BR maintains is so far out that it is
   impossible to compare it with that stored at the BR.

   In such situation, the primary Backbone Router has the possibility to
   assess the registration. this is performed by the protocol in use to
   register the node over the LLN.

   When the protocol used to register the nodes over the LLN is RPL
   [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl], the BR sends a targetted DIS to the registered
   address over the registered path.  A DAO back indicates that the
   current registration is still valid and provides the adequate data to
   resolve the conflict.

6.  Security Considerations

   This specification expects that the link layer is sufficiently
   protected, either by means of physical or IP security for the Transit
   Link or MAC sublayer cryptography.  In particular, it is expected
   that the LLN MAC provides secure unicast to/from the Backbone Router
   and secure broadcast from the Backbone Router in a way that prevents
   tempering with or replaying the RA messages.

   The use of EUI-64 for forming the Interface ID in the link local
   address prevents the usage of Secure ND ([RFC3971] and [RFC3972]) and
   address privacy techniques.  Considering the envisioned deployments
   and the MAC layer security applied, this is not considered an issue
   at this time.
