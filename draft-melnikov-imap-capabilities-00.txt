1.  Introduction

   This document clarifies how IMAP [RFC3501] server implementations
   should respond to CAPABILITY command or what they should return in
   CAPABILITY response code at different points in IMAP connection.
   This document updates RFC 3501.

   A CAPABILITY response or CAPABILITY response codes return a listing
   of capabilities that the server supports.  RFC 3501 didn't specify
   whether advertised capabilities can change over time and, if they
   can, at which points in IMAP connection.  This document clarifies
   that.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The term "IMAP connection" or just "connection" is as specified in
   [RFC3501].

3.  Clarification on CAPABILITY response/response code

   Two successive CAPABILITY commands (with no commands in between them)
   MUST return the same list of capabilities.

   The list of capabilities is generally static, but it can change at 2
   points in IMAP connection ("security state change points"): after a
   successful STARTTLS command and after a successful LOGIN or
   AUTHENTICATE command. () The list of capabilities MUST NOT change at
   any other points.

   With a small number of exceptions, capabilities can't be removed,
   they can only be added or their parameters might change.  Once a
   capability is announced, it can't be taken away in a subsequent

   CAPABILITY response, except for a few very limited cases.  For
   example, after STARTTLS command is successful, the STARTTLS
   capability doesn't need to be advertised (but it is not an error if
   it is).

   Capabilities that include parameter(s) can change their parameters at
   security state change points.  The later parameter(s) replace any
   previously announced parameters.

   A CAPABILITY response code can contain the same information as a
   CAPABILITY response.  Some implementations only return capabilities
   that apply in non-authenticated state before authentication and only
   capabilities that apply in authenticated/selected state after
   authentication.

4.  Examples

   TBD.  One example: after STARTTLS, AUTH=PLAIN and/or AUTH=EXTERNAL
   can be advertised.

   Second example: Show changing APPENDLIMIT parameter after
   authentication.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document doesn't require any action from IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   TBD
