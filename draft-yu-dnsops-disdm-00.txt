Abstract

   DM (Distribution Master) is used to transfer zone file data between
   the registry and the authoritative server.  The centralized DM system
   has the risk of a single point of failure.  The distributed DM
   architecture allows nodes to join and exit at any time to solve the
   single point of failure problem.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] [RFC8174]
   when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
