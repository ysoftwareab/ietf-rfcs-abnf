1.  Introduction

   This document defines the group-based policy (GBP) encapsulation for
   Geneve [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].  The GBP shim header carries a group
   policy ID that is semantically equivalent to the group policy ID
   defined in [I-D.smith-vxlan-group-policy].

   Group-based policy provides a more scalable alternative to access
   control lists (ACLs) by allowing separation of source marking and
   destination enforcement.  This allows a decrease in the amount of
   information needed at each entry node, rather than a cross product of
   every possible source and every possible destination.  It also allows
   assigning source marking based many different possibilities, not just
   the source address.  It also allows not having to know where the
   packet will end up since whatever the destination is can enforce the
   policy specific to the destination service.

2.  Treatment By Intermediate Nodes

   Any receiving device may use the group policy information contained
   in the Group-Based Policy (GBP) shim header.  If an intermediate
   device applies policy based upon the GBP shim header, then it must
   set the Policy Applied Bit, described below.

   Because the group policy information is associated with the payload
   (rather than the tunnel or other means by which it is conveyed), if
   an intermediate device terminates the Geneve tunnel and
   reencapsulates the data in a new tunnel with the ability to convey
   the group policy information, it SHOULD propagate the group policy
   information and the Policy Applied bit into the new tunnel, unless
   there is an explicit policy not to do so.  If an intermediate device
   can propagate only some of the group policy IDs, it SHOULD propagate
   as many as it can, and it MUST select which ones to propagate by the
   sequence that the GBP IDs are placed in the Geneve header.

3.  Group Based Policy Encapsulation in Geneve

   For encapsulating group policy IDs into Geneve [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve]
   the group policy ID field is included in the Geneve header using
   tunnel options.  The Group Policy ID field uses a tunnel option class
   specific for GBP.  In an administrative domain where GBP is used,
   insertion of the GBP tunnel option in Geneve is enabled at the Geneve
   tunnel endpoints.  The Geneve header is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].  GBP semantics are described in
   [I-D.smith-vxlan-group-policy].

   The packet format of the GBP ID when encapsulated in Geneve with a
   narrow Group Policy ID is shown in Figure 1.

   The GBP shim header consists of 8 octets, as illustrated in Figure 1.
   The first 4 octets are the Geneve Tunnel Option shim header
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve], whose format is as follows:

   Option Class:  16-bit unsigned integer that determines the GBP option
      class.  The value is from the IANA registry setup for Geneve
      option classes as defined in [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].

   Type:  8-bit unsigned integer defining the GBP ID type.  The
      following values are defined:

      0x00: GBP_Source_ID.  A value of 0 indicates that this shim header
         carries the Group Policy ID associated with the source of the
         packet.

      0x01: GBP_Destination_ID.  A value of 1 indicates that this shim
         header carries the Group Policy ID associated with the end
         destination of the packet.

      0x02 to 0x7F: Unassigned.  For assignment by IANA, as described in
         Section 5.

      0x80 to 0xFF: Locally Assigned.  For local assignment.

      If a packet carries a GBP_Destination_ID, it SHOULD also carry a
      GBP_Source_ID.

   R (3 bits):  Option control flags reserved for future use.  MUST be
      zero on transmission and ignored on receipt.

   Length:  5-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the GBP HDR in 4-octet
      units excluding the option header.  The value of this field is 1
      for this version.

   The next 4 octets are the GBP shim header, whose format is as
   follows:

   Policy Applied bit (A bit):  The A bit MUST be set on a specific GBP
      shim header if a frame is returned to a forwarding instance that
      it has already visited after having been redirected at a
      forwarding instance along the native forwarding path to its
      destination by a redirection policy that matched on the value in
      that specific GBP shim header.  If a GBP option type has the A bit
      set, a redirection policy that matches on this GBP option type
      MUST not be applied.  Redirection policies MAY continue to be
      applied so long as they only match on GBP option types that do not
      have the A bit set.  This procedure is necessary to prevent
      forwarding loops.  The method that ensures that on returned frames

Internet-Draft          GBP Geneve Encapsulation              April 2019


      the A bit is applied only to GBP option types involved in the
      match at the original redirection policy is outside the scope of
      this draft.  Once an A bit is set on a GBP shim header, it MUST
      remain set.  Additionally, once a GBP ID is set for a GBP option
      type it SHOULD not be changed to avoid redirection related loops.

   Rsvd (5 bits):  reserved for future use.  MUST be zero on
      transmission and ignored on receipt.

   Ver (2 bits):  indicates the Version of the Group Policy shim header.
      The initial version is 0.

   Reserved (8 bits):  When using a 16-bit Group Policy ID, these 8 bits
      are reserved for future use and MUST be set to zero on
      transmission and ignored on receipt.

   Group Policy ID:  16-bit identifier that indicates the Group Policy
      ID being encapsulated by this GBP shim header.  The Default GBP ID
      value is special and indicates that the GBP option was not set.
      Packet filters SHOULD be able to match on the Default GBP ID value
      as a way to match packets that do not have the GBP option set.
      The default Default GBP ID is 0, but MAY be configured to be a
      value other than 0.  The allocation of Group Policy ID values is
      outside the scope of this document.

4.  Use Of Multiple GBP shim headers

   A tunnel header MAY carry multiple GBP shim headers where each GBP
   shim header carries a unique GBP type.  There MUST be only one shim
   header of a specific GBP type per tunneled packet.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Genve Option Class Value

   IANA is requested to allocate a Geneve "option class" number for GBP:

               +---------------+-------------+---------------+
               | Option Class  | Description | Reference     |
               +---------------+-------------+---------------+
               | TBD           | GBP_ID      | This document |
               +---------------+-------------+---------------+

5.2.  GBP Type Values

   IANA is requested to set up a registry of "GBP Type".  These are
   8-bit values.  GBP Type values in the table below are defined in this

   draft.  New values in the range of 0x02 through 0x7F are assigned via
   Standards Action [RFC5226].

               +----------------+--------------------+---------------+
               | GBP Type Value | Description        | Reference     |
               +----------------+--------------------+---------------+
               | 0x00           | GBP_Source_ID      | This document |
               +----------------+--------------------+---------------+
               | 0x01           | GBP_Destination_ID | This document |
               +----------------+--------------------+---------------+
               | 0x02 - 0x7F    | Unassigned         |               |
               +----------------+--------------------+---------------+
               | 0x80 - 0xFF    | Local assignment   |               |
               +----------------+--------------------+---------------+

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of Geneve are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].  The security considerations of GBP are
   discussed in [I-D.smith-vxlan-group-policy].

   Additionally, the security policy value carried in the GBP shim
   header impacts security directly.  There is a risk that this
   identifier could be altered.  Accordingly, the network should be
   designed such that this header can be inserted only by trusted
   entities, and can not be altered before reaching the destination.
   This can be mitigated through physical security of the network and/or
   by encryption or validation of the entire packet, including the GBP.
