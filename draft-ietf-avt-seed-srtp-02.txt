1. Introduction 

   This document describes the use of SEED block cipher algorithm in the 
   Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for confidentiality to the 
   RTP traffic and to the control traffic for RTP, the Real-time 
   Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) 

1.1. SEED 

   SEED is a national industrial association standard [TTASSEED] and is 
   widely used in South Korea for electronic commerce and financial 
   services that are operated on wired and wireless communications. 

   As of Sep 2003, its source code in C has been distributed to 600 
   businesses including academic and research institutes by KISA through 
   e-mail. Moreover, there are several international corporations in the 
   number of businesses. 

   The usage of SEED has been covered the security service applications 
   such as e-Commerce, e-mail, dedicated receiver with Broadcasting, 
   financial service, data storage, electronic toll collection, VPN, 
   Digital Right Management, etc. 

   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in 
   [ISOSEED] [SEED]. The SEED homepage, http://www.kisa.or.kr, contains 
   a wealth of information about SEED, including detailed specification, 
   evaluation report, test vectors, and so on. 

1.2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

2. Cipher Suite Definitions 

2.1. Mode 

2.1.1. Counter 

   Section 4.1.1 of [RFC3711] defines AES counter mode encryption, 
   which it refers to as AES-CM. SEED counter mode is defined in a 
   similar manner, and is denoted as SEED_CM respectively. The 
   plaintext inputs to the block cipher are formed as in AES-CM, and 
   the block cipher outputs are processed as in AES-CM. The only 
   difference in the processing is that SEED-CM use SEED. SEED-CM use 
   a 112-bit salt as an input, as does AES-CM.

2.1.2. Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) 

   CCM is a generic authenticate-and-encrypt block cipher mode [CCM]. 
   In this specification, CCM is used with the SEED block cipher. 

   SEED CCM has two parameters: 

   M indicates the authentication tag. CCM defines values of 4, 6, 8, 
   10, 12, 14, and 16 octets; In [RFC3711], the authentication tag 
   size is 4 octets. Implementation MUST support M values of 4 octets. 

   L indicates the size of the length field in octets. CCM defines 
   values of L between 2 octets and 8 octets. Implementations MUST 
   support an L value of 4 octets, which accommodates a full 
   Jumbogram [JUMBO]; however, the length includes all of the 
   encrypted data. 

   SEED CCM has four inputs: 

   Key 

    An encryption key K suitable for the block cipher. SEED supports 
    128-bit key, and implementations MUST support this key size. 

   Nonce 

    Section 4.1.1 of [RFC3711] defines the IV that is necessary to 
    construct the sequence of counter blocks used by counter mode 
    to generate the key stream. The SEED counter block is 16 octets. 

   Payload 

    The payload of the RTP packet. The payload MUST NOT be longer 
    than 4,294,967,295 octets, which is the maximum size of a 
    Jumbogram. 

   AAD 

    The header of the RTP packet. CCM does not allow additional 
    authenticated data (AAD) to be longer than 
    18,446,744,073,709,551,615 octets. 

2.1.3. Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) 

   GCM is a block cipher mode of operation providing both 
   confidentiality and data origin authentication [GCM]. GCM is 
   used with the SEED block cipher. 

   Four inputs for SEED GCM are described in Section 2.1.2

2.2. Key Size and Number of Rounds 

   SEED supports 128-bit key and has the 16-round Feistel structure. 

2.3. Block Size 

   SEED uses a block size of 16 octets (128 bits). 

3. Security Considerations 

   No security problem has been found on SEED. SEED is secure against 
   all known attacks including Differential cryptanalysis, linear 
   cryptanalysis, and related key attacks. The best known attack is only 
   an exhaustive search for the key. For further security considerations, 
   the reader is encouraged to read [CRYPTREC] and [SEED-EVAL].
