TYPE = Router Solicitation

      A: Not Used

      B: Not Used

TYPE = Router Advertisement

      A: Reachable Time Compression:

         1: Reachable time field elided.  Assume reachable time is zero.

         0: Reachable time field inlined.

      B: Retrans Time Compression:

         1: Retrans time field elided.  Assume retrans time is zero.

         0: Retrans time field inlined.

TYPE = Neighbor Solicitation or Neighbor Advertisement.  In this case
TYPE = Redirect

      A: TARGET ADDRESS field compression:

         1: Target address field elided, assume target address is same
         as destination address field.

         0: Target address field inlined.

      B: Not used


OPTTYPE = Source Link-Layer Address or Target Link-Layer Address.

      HI: L2 Address Source:

         00: L2 Address and Address Length Inline

         01: L2 Address taken from L2 Source

         10: L2 Address taken from L2 Dest

      J: Length Compression:

         0: Disabled

         1: Enabled (only valid if HI = 00).  Length compression removes
         any trailing zeros from the option, to a maximum of 15.  It
         then splits the 'length' field up into two nibbles, and writes
         the number of trailing zeros removed in the upper nibble of the
         length field.

      K: Not used

OPTTYPE = Prefix Information

      H: On-Link/Autoconfiguration Flag Compression:

         1: 'L', 'A', and 6 bits of reserved space elided.  When
         reconstructing option set L=0, A=1
         0: 'L', 'A', and 6 bits of reserved space inlined

      I: Valid Lifetime Compression:

         1: Valid lifetime elided, assumed to be infinite (0xFFFFFFFF)

         0: Valid Lifetime inlined

      J: Preferred Lifetime Compression:

         1: Preferred lifetime elided, assumed to be same as valid.

         0: Preferred Lifetime inlined

      K: Prefix length compression

         1: Prefix length is elided, assumed to be 64 bits

         0: Prefix length inlined

      K: Not Used

OPTTYPE = MTU

      H: MTU Compression:

         1: MTU is 1260

         0: MTU is contained in next two bytes

      I: Not Used

      J: Not Used

      K: Not Used

OPTTYPE = Address Registration

      H: EUI64 Compression:
         1: EUI64 Elided, copy from destination L2 Address

         0: EUI64 Inlined

      I: Registered Address Compression (Only valid if 'Registered
      Address Present Flag' is set):

         1: Registered address elided, take from NA or NS TARGET address

         0: Registered address inlined

      J: Registered Address Present Flag:

         1: Registered address present, so length field is 4

         0: Registered address not present, so length field is 2

      K: Not Used

OPTTYPE = 6LoWPAN Context

      H: Context Length Compression:

         1: Context length is elided, assumed to be 64
