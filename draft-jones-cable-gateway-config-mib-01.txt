1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
    
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [12]. 
 
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [7], STD 58, RFC 2579 [8] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [9].

2. Glossary 
    
   The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable 
   system usage, from normal residential gateway operation, or from the 
   documents associated with the CableHome Specifications [21]. 
       
2.1 CableHome Residential Gateway 
    
   A CableHome Residential gateway passes data traffic between the cable 
   operator's broadband data network (the Wide Area Network, WAN) and 
   the Local Area Network (LAN) in the cable data service subscriber's 
   residence or business. In addition to passing traffic between the WAN 
   and LAN, the CableHome Residential Gateway provides several services 
   including a DHCP client and a DHCP server (RFC2131) [22], a TFTP 
   server (RFC1350) [23], management services as enabled by 
   SNMPv1/v2c/v3 agent compliant with the RFCs listed in Section 1, and 
   security services including stateful packet inspection firewall 
   functionality and software code image verification using techniques. 
        
2.2 Portal Services 
    
   A logical element aggregating the set of CableHome-specified 
   functionality in a CableHome compliant cable gateway device. 
    
    
2.3 LAN IP Device  
        
   A LAN IP Device is representative of a typical IP device expected to 
   reside on home networks, and is assumed to contain a TCP/IP stack as 
   well as a DHCP client. 
    
2.4 WAN Management (WAN-Man) Address  
        
   WAN Management Addresses are intended for network management traffic 
   on the cable network between the network management system and the PS 
   element. Typically, these addresses will reside in private IP address 
   space.  
        
2.5 WAN Data (WAN-Data) Address  
        
   WAN Data Addresses are intended for subscriber application traffic on 
   the cable network and beyond, such as traffic between LAN IP Devices 
   and Internet hosts. Typically, these addresses will reside in public 
   IP address space.  
        
2.6 LAN Translated (LAN-Trans) Address  
        
   LAN Translated Addresses are intended for subscriber application and 
   management traffic on the home network between LAN IP Devices and the

   PS element. Typically, these addresses will reside in private IP 
   address space, and can typically be reused across subscribers. 
    
2.7 LAN Passthrough (LAN-Pass) Address  
     
   LAN Passthrough Addresses are intended for subscriber application 
   traffic, such as traffic between LAN IP Devices and Internet hosts, 
   on the home network, the cable network, and beyond. Typically, these 
   addresses will reside in public IP address space.  
        
2.8 Cable Gateway DHCP Portal (CDP) 
 
   A logical element residing within the PS that encapsulates DHCP 
   functionality within a Cable Gateway Device. This includes both DHCP 
   client as well as DHCP server capabilities. 
    
    
3. Overview 
    
   This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of 
   DHCP client and server functionality within CableHome compliant 
   Residential Gateways (RG).  The specification is derived from the 
   CableHome Specification [21]. 
    
   The DHCP client within a Cable Gateway will acquire one or more 
   addresses from WAN based DHCP servers. Collectively, these are known 
   as WAN addresses. These addresses are used for both management 
   traffic (WAN management addresses) and data traffic (WAN data 
   addresses) to and from the WAN side of the residential gateway. 
    
   The DHCP server within a Cable Gateway will provide private addresses 
   to LAN IP Devices. These addresses will be translated to and from one 
   of the WAN IP addresses for traffic that enters or exits the LAN, and 
   are and collectively known as LAN Translated Addresses. 
    
   There are a number of logical functional elements used to describe 
   Cable Gateway configuration functionality.  
        
  û The Portal Services (PS) logical element is the functional entity 
     that aggregates all specified Cable Gateway capabilities.   
    
  û The Cable Gateway DHCP Portal (CDP) logical element is the 
     functional entity that embodies the Cable Gateway DHCP 
     capabilities.   
    
    
3.1 Structure of the MIB 
    
   This MIB is structured into three groups: 
     
 
 
Cardona/Luehrs/Jones     Expires - July 2003                 [Page 4] 
Internet-Draft   CableHome Gateway Configuration MIB     January 2003 
 
  û The cabhCdpBase group provides baseline and information for RG DHCP 
     client and server functionality, including reset information, 
     counts for WAN addresses acquired, and counts for LAN addresses 
     served.   
  
  û The cabhCdpAddr group provides information about dynamically 
     acquired and served addresses within the RG, and includes the 
     following tables:   
  
     o   cabhCdpLanAddrTable: information and reservations for addresses 
         served to the LAN  
     o   cabhCdpWanDataAddrTable: WAN address acquisition information  
     o   cabhCdpWanDataAddrServerTable: WAN based DNS server information  
     
  û The cabhCdpServer group provides information about the RG DHCP 
     service (address pool range, subnet information, RG Based server 
     info, etc).   
 
    
3.2 Cable Gateway Configuration System Description  
 
   The functional element that encapsulates DHCP functionality within 
   the Cable Gateway is known as the Cable Gateway DHCP Portal (CDP). 
 
   The CDP operating assumptions include: 
    
  û LAN IP Devices implement a DHCP client as defined by  [RFC 2131]. 
    
  û The cable network provisioning system implements a DHCP server as 
     defined by [RFC 2131]. 
    
  û If the cable network provisioning system's DHCP server supports 
     DHCP Option 61 (client identifier option),the WAN-Man and all WAN-
     Data IP interfaces can share a common MAC address. 
    
  û LAN IP Devices may support various DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor 
     Extensions, allowed by [RFC 2132]. 
 
 
   The following design guidelines drive the capabilities defined for 
   the CDP: 
    
  û CableHome addressing mechanisms will be MSO controlled, and will 
     provide MSO knowledge of and accessibility to CableHome network 
     elements and LAN IP Devices. 
    
  û CableHome address acquisition and management processes will not 
     require human intervention (assuming that a user/household account 
     has already been established). 
    
 
 
Cardona/Luehrs/Jones     Expires - July 2003                 [Page 5] 
Internet-Draft   CableHome Gateway Configuration MIB     January 2003 
 
  û CableHome address acquisition and management will be scalable to 
     support the expected increase in the number of LAN IP devices. 
    
  û It is preferable for LAN IP Device addresses to remain the same 
     after events such as a power cycle or Internet Service Provider 
     switch. 
    
  û CableHome will provide a mechanism by which the number of LAN IP 
     Devices in the LAN-Trans realm can be monitored and controlled. 
    
  û In home communication will continue to work as provisioned during 
     periods of Headend address server outage.  Addressing support will 
     be provided for newly added LAN IP Devices and address expirations 
     during remote address server outages. 
    
  û IP addresses will be conserved when possible (both globally 
     routable addresses and private cable network management addresses).   
    
    
    
   3.2.1  Cable Gateway DHCP Portal (CDP) System Description  
 
   The Cable Gateway DHCP Portal is the logical entity that is 
   responsible for CableHome addressing activities. The CDP address 
   request and address allocation responsibilities within the CableHome 
   environment include: 
 
  û IP address assignment, IP address maintenance, and the delivery of 
     configuration parameters (via DHCP) to LAN IP Devices in the LAN-
     Trans Address Realm. 
   
  û Acquisition of a WAN-Man and zero or more WAN-Data IP addresses and 
     associated DHCP configuration parameters for the Portal Services 
     (PS) element. 
   
  û Provide information to the CableHome Name Portal (CNP) in support 
     of LAN IP Device host name services.  
        
   The PS maintains two hardware addresses, one of which is to be used 
   to acquire an IP address for management purpose, the other could be 
   used for the acquisition of one or more IP address(es) for data. To 
   prevent hardware address spoofing, the PS does not allow either of 
   the two hardware addresses to be modified. 
    
   The Portal Services element requires an IP Address on the home LAN 
   for its role on the LAN as a router (see Section 8 in [21], Packet 
   Handling and Address Translation), DHCP Server (CDS), and DNS 
   Server). For each of these three Portal Service Element server and 
   router functions, a LAN IP address is saved in the PS database. Each 
   can be accessed via a different MIB object, which are listed below:

Internet-Draft   CableHome Gateway Configuration MIB     January 2003 
 
        
  û Router (default gateway) Address cabhCdpServerRouter 
  û Domain Name Server (DNS) Address cabhCdpServerDnsAddress 
  û Dynamic Host Configuration Server (DHCP) (CDS) Address 
     cabhCdpServerDhcpAddress  
        
   The default value of cabhCdpServerRouter is 192.168.0.1. The default 
   values of cabhCdpServerDnsAddress and cabhCdpServerDhcpAddress are 
   equal to the value of cabhCdpServerRouter. The CDP capabilities are 
   embodied by two functional elements residing within the CDP:  
        
  û the Cable Gateway DHCP Server (CDS) 
  û the Cable Gateway DHCP Client (CDC).   
 
   The CDC exchanges DHCP messages with the DHCP server in the cable 
   network (WAN-Management address realm) to acquire an IP address and 
   DHCP options for the PS, for management purposes. The CDC could also 
   exchange DHCP messages with the DHCP server in the cable network 
   (WAN-Data address realm) to acquire zero or more IP address(es) on 
   behalf of LAN IP Devices in the LAN-Trans realm. The CDS exchanges 
   DHCP messages with LAN IP Devices in the LAN-Trans realm, and assigns 
   private IP addresses, grants leases to, and could provide DHCP 
   options to DHCP clients within those LAN IP Devices. LAN IP Devices 
   in the LAN-Pass realm receive their IP addresses, leases, and DHCP 
   options directly from the DHCP server in the cable network. The CDP 
   simply bridges DHCP messages between the DHCP server in the cable 
   network and LAN IP Devices in the LAN-Pass realm. Figure 1 
   illustrates these concepts.

3.2.1.1 Cable Gateway DHCP Server (CDS) System Description  
 
   The CDS is a standard DHCP server as defined in [RFC 2131], and 
   responsibilities include: 
    
  û The CDS assigns addresses to and delivers DHCP configuration 
     parameters to LAN IP Devices receiving an address in the LAN-Trans 
     address realm. The CDS learns DHCP options from the NMS system and 
     provides these DHCP options to LAN IP Devices. If DHCP options have 
     not been provided by the NMS system (for example when the PS boots 
     during a cable outage), the CDS relies on built-in default values 
     (DefVals) for required options. 
   
  û The CDS is able to provide DHCP addressing services to LAN IP 
     Devices, independent of the WAN connectivity state. 
 
  û The number of addresses supplied by the CDS to LAN IP Devices is 
     controllable by the NMS system. The behavior of the CDS when a 
     cable operator settable limit is exceeded is also configurable via 
     the NMS. Possible CDS actions when the limit is exceeded include 
     (1) assign a LAN-Trans IP address and treat the WAN to LAN 
     interconnection as would normally occur if the limit had not been 
     exceeded and (2) do not assign an address to requesting LAN IP 
     devices.  An address threshold  setting of 0 indicates the maximum 
     threshold possible for the LAN-Trans IP address pool defined by the 
     pool "start" (cabhCdpLanPoolStart) and "end" (cabhCdpLanPoolEnd) 
     values. 
 
  û In the absence of time of day information from the Time of Day 
     (ToD) server, the CDS uses the PS default starting time of 0 
     (January 1, 1970), updates the Expire Time for any active leases in 
     the LAN-Trans realm to re-synchronize with DHCP clients in LAN IP 
     Devices, and maintains leases based on that starting point until 
     the PS synchronizes with the Time of Day server in the cable 
     network. 
 
  û During the PS Boot process, the CDS remains inactive until 
     activated by the PS. 
 
  û If the PS Primary Packet-handling mode [21] has been set to 
     Passthrough AND the PS provisioning process has completed, then the 
     CDS is disabled. 
 
  LAN IP Devices may receive addresses that reside in the LAN-Pass 
  realm. As shown in Figure 7-2 [21], LAN-Pass address requests are 
  served by the WAN addressing infrastructure, not the PS. LAN-Pass 
  addressing processes will occur when the PS is configured to operate 
  in Passthrough Mode or Mixed Bridging/Routing Mode. In these cases,

Internet-Draft   CableHome Gateway Configuration MIB     January 2003 
 
  DHCP   interactions will take place directly between LAN IP Devices 
  and Headend servers, and CableHome does not specify the process. 
   
  Throughout this document, the terms Dynamic Allocation and Manual 
  Allocation are used as defined in [RFC 2131]. The CDS Provisioned 
  DHCP Options, cabhCdpServer objects in the CDP MIB, are DHCP Options 
  that can be provisioned by the NMS, and are offered by the CDS to LAN 
  IP devices assigned a LAN-Trans address. CDS Provisioned DHCP 
  Options, cabhCdpServer objects, persist after a PS power cycle and 
  the NMS system can establish, read, write and delete these objects. 
  CDS Provisioned DHCP Options, cabhCdpServer objects, are retained 
  during periods of cable outage and these objects are offered to LAN 
  IP devices assigned a LAN-Trans address during periods of cable 
  outage. The CDC persistent storage of DHCP options is consistent with  
  [RFC 2131] section 2.1. The default values of CDS Provisioned DHCP 
  Options, cabhCdpServer objects, are defined and the NMS can reset the  
  CDS Provisioned DHCP Options, cabhCdpServer objects, to their default 
  values, by writing to the cabhCdpSetToFactory MIB object. 
   
  The CDS Address Threshold (cabhCdpLanTrans) objects contain the event 
  control parameters used by the CDS to cause a notification to be sent 
  to the Headend management system, when the number of LAN-Trans 
  addresses assigned by the CDS exceeds the preset threshold. 
   
  The Address Count (cabhCdpLanTransCurCount) object is a value 
  indicating the number of LAN-Trans addresses assigned by the CDS that  
  have active DHCP leases.  
        
   The Address Threshold (cabhCdpLanTransThreshold) object is a value 
   indicating when a notification is generated to the Headend management 
   system. The notification is generated when the CDS assigns an address 
   to the LAN IP Device that causes the Address Count 
   (cabhCdpLanTransCurCount) to exceed the Address Threshold 
   (cabhCdpLanTransThreshold). 
    
   The Threshold Exceeded Action (cabhCdpLanTransAction) is the action 
   taken by the CDS while the Address Count (cabhCdpLanTransCurCount) 
   exceeds the Address Threshold (cabhCdpLanTransThreshold). If the 
   Threshold Exceeded Action (cabhCdpLanTransAction) allows address  
   assignments after the count is exceeded, the notification is  
   generated each time an address is assigned. The defined actions are 
   a) assign a LAN-Trans address as normal, and b) do not assign an 
   address to the next requesting LAN IP Device. 
    
   The Address Count (cabhCdpLanTransCurCount) continues to be updated 
   during periods of cable outage. The CDS MIB also contains the Address 
   Pool Start (cabhCdpLanPoolStart) and Address Pool End  
   (cabhCdpLanPoolEnd) parameters. These parameters indicate the range 
   of addresses in the LAN-Trans realm that can be assigned by the CDS 
   to LAN IP Devices.

   The CDP LAN Address Table (cabhCdpLanAddrTable) contains the list of 
   parameters associated with addresses allocated to LAN IP Devices with 
   LAN-Trans addresses. These parameters   include:  
        
  û The Client Identifiers [RFC 2132] section 9.14 
     (cabhCdpLanAddrClientID) 
   
  û The LAN IP address assigned to the client (cabhCdpLanAddrIp) 
 
  û An indication that the address was allocated either manually or 
     dynamically (via the CDP)(cabhCdpLanAddrConfig) 
 
   The CDS stores information about the identification of a LAN IP 
   Device in the object cabhCdpLanAddrClientID. The first priority for 
   the value to be stored in this object is the Client ID value passed 
   by the LAN IP Device in DHCP Option 61, Client Identifier. If no 
   value is passed in Option 61, the CDS stores the value passed in the 
   chaddr field of the DHCP DISCOVER message issued by the LAN IP 
   Device. 
    
   The CDS creates a CDP Table (cabhCdpLanAddrTable) entry when it 
   allocates an IP address to a LAN IP Device. The CDS can create CDP 
   Table (cabhCdpLanAddrTable) entries during periods of cable outage. 
    
   The CDP Table (cabhCdpLanAddrTable) maintains a DHCP lease time for  
   each LAN IP Device. 
    
   NMS-provisioned CDP Table (cabhCdpLanAddrTable) entries are retained 
   during periods of cable outage and persist across a PS power-cycle. 
    
3.2.1.2 Cable Gateway DHCP Client (CDC) System Description 
 
   The CDC is a standard DHCP client as defined in [RFC 2131], and  
   responsibilities include: 
    
  û The CDC makes requests to Headend DHCP servers for the acquisition 
     of addresses in the WAN-Man and may make requests to Headend DHCP 
     servers for the acquisition of addresses in the WAN-Data address 
     realms. The CDC also understands and acts upon a number of 
     CableHome DHCP configuration parameters.  
      
  û The CDC supports acquisition of one WAN-Man IP address and zero or 
     more WAN-Data IP addresses. 
    
  û The CDC supports the Vendor Class Identifier Option (DHCP option 
     60), the Vendor Specific Information option (DHCP Option 43), and 
     the Client Identifier Option (DHCP option 61).

Internet-Draft   CableHome Gateway Configuration MIB     January 2003 
 
  û In the default case, the CDC will acquire a single IP address for 
     simultaneous use by the WAN-Man and WAN-Data IP interfaces. In 
     order to minimize changes needed to existing Headend DHCP servers, 
     the use of a Client Identifier (DHCP option 61) by the CDC is not 
     required in this default case.  
 
   The CDP supports various DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions, 
   allowed by [RFC 2132]. 
    
   The Vendor Class Identifier Option (DHCP option 60) defines a 
   CableLabs device class. For CableHome 1.0, the Vendor Class 
   Identifier Option will contain the string "CableHome1.0", to identify 
   a CableHome 1.0 Portal Services (PS) logical element, whenever the 
   CDC requests a WAN-Man or WAN-Data address. 
    
   The Vendor Specific Information option (DHCP Option 43) further 
   identifies the type of device and its capabilities. It describes the 
   type of component that is making the request (embedded or standalone, 
   CM or PS), the components that are contained in the device (CM, MTA, 
   PS, etc.), the device serial number, and also allows device specific 
   parameters. {add reference to CH spec and the DHCP options table} 
    
   The WAN-Data IP Address count parameter of the CDP MIB 
   (cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount) is the number of IP address leases the 
   CDC is required to attempt to acquire for the WAN side of NAT and 
   NAPT mappings. The default value of cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount is 
   zero, which means that, by default, the CDC will acquire only a WAN-
   Man IP address. 
    
    
3.2.1.2.1 Cable Gateway DHCP Client Option 61 
 
   The CableHome PS element can have one or more WAN IP addresses 
   associated with a one or more link layer (e.g. MAC) interfaces. 
   Therefore, the CDC cannot rely solely on a MAC address as a unique 
   client identifier value. 
    
   CableHome allows for the use of the Client Identifier Option (DHCP 
   option 61), [RFC 2132] section 9.14, to uniquely identify the logical 
   WAN interface associated with a particular IP address. 
    
   The PS is required to have two hardware addresses: one to be used to 
   uniquely identify the logical WAN interface associated with the WAN-
   Man IP address (WAN-Man hardware address) and the other to be used to 
   uniquely identify the logical WAN interface associated with WAN-Data 
   IP addresses (WAN-Data hardware address).

3.2.1.2.2 WAN Address Modes 
 
   In order to enable compatibility with as many cable operator 
   provisioning systems as possible, the CDC will support the following 
   configurable WAN Address Modes: 
 
  û WAN Address Mode 0: The PS Element makes use of a single WAN IP 
     Address, acquired via DHCP using the WAN-Man hardware address. The 
     PS Element has one WAN-Man IP Interface and zero WAN-Data IP 
     Interfaces. This Address Mode is only applicable when the PS 
     Primary Packet-handling Mode (cabhCapPrimaryMode) is set to 
     Passthrough (refer to [21] Section 8.3.2). The cable operator's 
     Headend DHCP server typically needs no software modifications to 
     support this Address Mode. In WAN Address Mode 0, the value of 
     cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount is zero. 
 
  û WAN Address Mode 1: The PS Element makes use of a single WAN IP 
     Address, acquired via DHCP using the WAN-Man hardware address. The 
     PS Element has one WAN-Man IP Interface and one WAN-Data IP 
     Interface. These two Interfaces share a single, common IP address. 
     This Address Mode is only applicable when the PS Primary Packet- 
     handling Mode (cabhCapPrimaryMode) is set to NAPT. The cable 
     operator's Headend DHCP server typically needs no software 
     modifications to support this Address Mode. In WAN Address Mode 1, 
     the value of cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount is zero. 
 
  û WAN Address Mode 2: The PS Element acquires a WAN-Man IP address 
     using the unique WAN-Man hardware address, and is subsequently 
     configured by the NMS to request one or more unique WAN-Data IP 
     Address(es). The PS Element will have one WAN-Man and one or more 
     WAN-Data IP Interface(s). All WAN-Data IP addresses will share a 
     common hardware address that is unique from the WAN- Man hardware 
     address. The two or more Interfaces (one WAN-Man and one or more 
     WAN-Data) each has its own, unshared IP address. The CDP is 
     configured by the cable operator to operate in WAN Address Mode 2 
     by writing a nonzero value to cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount, via the PS 
     Configuration File or an SNMP set-request. This Address Mode is 
     applicable when the PS Primary Packet-handling Mode 
     (cabhCapPrimaryMode) is set to NAPT or NAT. The cable operator's 
     Headend DHCP server might need software modification to include 
     support for Client IDs (DHCP Option 61) so that it can assign 
     multiple IP addresses to the single WAN-Data hardware address. 
 
   There are four potential scenarios for WAN-Data IP addresses:  
        
   1. The PS is configured to request zero WAN-Data IP addresses. No 
   WAN-Data Client IDs are needed. 
     
   2. The PS is configured to request one or more WAN-Data IP addresses 
   and there are no MSO-configured cabhCdpWanDataAddrClientId entries in 
 
 
Cardona/Luehrs/Jones     Expires - July 2003                [Page 12] 
Internet-Draft   CableHome Gateway Configuration MIB     January 2003 
 
   the CDP MIB. The PS is required to auto-generate as many unique WAN-
   Data Client IDs as the value of cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount.  
    
   3. The PS is configured to request one or more WAN-Data IP addresses 
   and there are at least as many MSO configured 
   cabhCdpWanDataAddrClientId entries as the value of 
   cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount, i.e., the MSO has provisioned enough WAN-
   Data Client ID values. The PS does not auto-generate any Client IDs.  
     
   4. The PS is configured to request one or more WAN-Data IP addresses 
   and there are fewer MSO-configured cabhCdpWanDataAddrClientId entries 
   than the value of cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount, i.e., the MSO has 
   provisioned some but not provisioned enough WAN-Data Client ID 
   values. The PS is required to auto-generate enough additional unique 
   WAN-Data Client IDs to bring the total number of unique WAN-Data 
   Client IDs to the value of cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount. 
 
 
   If the cable operator desires for the PS to acquire one or more WAN-
   Data IP addresses, that are distinct from the WAN-Man IP address, the 
   procedure is as follows. For all WAN Address Modes, the PS first 
   requests a WAN-Man IP address using the WAN-Man hardware address. The 
   procedure described below assumes the PS has already acquired a WAN-
   Man IP address:  
    
   1. The cable operator optionally provisions the PS with unique 
   specific Client IDs, by writing values to the 
   cabhCdpWanDataAddrClientId entries of the CDP MIB 
   cabhCdpWanDataAddrTable, via the PS Configuration File or SNMP set-
   request message(s).  
    
   2. The cable operator configures the CDP to operate in WAN Address 
   Mode 2 by writing cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount to a nonzero value 
   through the PS Configuration File or SNMP set-request message.  
    
   3. After the CDP has been configured to operate in WAN Address Mode 2 
   as described in step 2), the PS checks to see if Client ID values 
   have been provisioned by the NMS as described in step 1). If a number 
   of Client ID values greater than or equal to the value of 
   cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount have been provisioned, the PS uses these 
   values in DHCP Option 61 when requesting the WAN-Data IP address(es). 
   If Client ID values have not been provisioned, i.e., if the 
   cabhCdpWanDataAddrClientId entries do not exist, or if the number of 
   Client ID values provisioned is less than the value of 
   cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount, the PS generates a number of unique Client 
   ID values such that, in combination with the provisioned Client IDs, 
   the total number of unique Client IDs equals the value of 
   cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount. The PS generates Client ID values by using 
   the WAN-Data hardware address alone for the first requested WAN-Data 
   IP address, and by concatenating the WAN- Data hardware address with 
 
 
Cardona/Luehrs/Jones     Expires - July 2003                [Page 13] 
Internet-Draft   CableHome Gateway Configuration MIB     January 2003 
 
   a count that is 8 bits in length for the second and all subsequent 
   WAN-Data IP addresses. If no Client IDs have been provisioned by the 
   NMS, the first 8-bit Count value is 0x02 (indicating the second 
   requested WAN-Data IP address), the second count value is 0x03, and 
   so on. 
 
   The following is an example for the case when no Client IDs have been 
   provisioned by the network management system.  Given WAN-Data 
   hardware address 0xCDCDCDCDCDCD: 
 
  û PS-generated Client ID for the first requested WAN-Data IP address: 
     0xCDCDCDCDCDCD 
  û PS-generated Client ID for the second requested WAN-Data IP 
     address: 0xCDCDCDCDCDCD02 
  û PS-generated Client ID for the third requested WAN-Data IP address: 
     0xCDCDCDCDCDCD03 
  û PS-generated Client ID for the nth requested WAN-Data IP address: 
     0xCDCDCDCDCDCDn (n=<0xFF)  
 
   If some Client IDs have been provisioned by the NMS but the number is 
   less than the value of cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount, the PS generates 
   additional Client IDs as needed to bring the total number of Client 
   IDs to the value of cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount. The PS will generate 
   these additional Client IDs values by appending an 8-bit count value 
   to the WAN-Data hardware address, starting with 0x02, unless that 
   would duplicate a provisioned Client ID. If the Client IDs 
   provisioned by the NMS follow the same format (hardware address with 
   8-bit count value), the PS is required to use a unique count value so 
   as to not duplicate a provisioned Client ID. 
 
   Example for the case when Client IDs have been provisioned by the NMS 
   (three provisioned Client ID values, cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount = 5). 
   Given WAN-Data hardware address 0xCDCDCDCDCDCD: 
 
  û First provisioned Client ID for the first WAN-Data IP address: 
     0x0A0A0A0A0A1A 
  û Second provisioned Client ID for the second WAN-Data IP address: 
     0x0A0A0A0A0A2A 
  û Third provisioned Client ID for the third WAN-Data IP address: 
     0x0A0A0A0A0A3A 
  û First Client ID generated by the PS for the fourth requested WAN-
     Data IP address: 0xCDCDCDCDCDCD02 
  û Second Client ID generated by the PS for the fifth requested WAN-
     Data IP address: 0xCDCDCDCDCDCD03  
 
   4. The PS adds the Client ID values it generates as 
   cabhCdpWanDataAddrClientId entries to the end of the 
   cabhCdpWanDataAddrTable.

   5. The PS (CDC) requests (repeating the DHCP DISCOVER process as 
   needed) as many unique WAN-Data IP addresses as the value of 
   cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount specifies, using the WAN-Data hardware 
   address in the chaddr field of the DHCP message and the Client ID 
   value(s) from step 3) in DHCP Option 61, beginning with the first 
   cabhCdpWanDataAddrClientId entry of the cabhCdpWanDataAddrTable. The 
   CDC is not permitted to request more WAN-Data IP addresses than the 
   value of cabhCdpWanDataIpAddrCount, even if the number of provisioned 
   Client IDs is greater than the value of cabhCdpWanDataAddrTable.

               "This table is a list of LAN-Trans realm parameters. 
                This table has one row entry for each allocated 
                LAN-Trans IP address. Each row must have at least a 
                valid cabhCdpLanAddrMethod, a cabhCdpLanAddrIpType, 
                a unique cabhCdpLanAddrIp, and a unique 
                cabhCdpLanAddrClientId value. 
                
                Static/Manual address assignment: To create a new 
                DHCP address reservation, the NMS creates a row with: 
                an index comprised of a new cabhCdpLanAddrIp and its

                syntax and values of the new row - indicating a 
                reservation - are valid, the PS must set 
                cabhCdpLanAddrMethod to reservationInactive(1) and 
                cabhCdpLanDataAddrRowStatus to active(1). When the PS

                cabhCdpLanAddrMethod object for that row to

5. Formal Syntax 
    
    
   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur 
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [3]. 
    
    
    
6. Security Considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations. 
    
   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and 
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
   them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide 
   features for such a secure environment. 
    
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.  
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects 
   in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as 
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
