2.  Introduction

   Rbridges are transparent Layer 2 bridges that provide the ability to
   have an entire campus, with multiple physical links look like a
   single subnet.  The Rbridge technology utilizes Rbridges to link
   together Layer 2 areas using spanning trees to calculate paths.  The
   Rbridges run a link state protocol to determine the least cost paths
   Rbridges and exchange information about the location of MAC
   addresses.  Rbridges calculate one spanning tree and distables the
   use of equal cost links by utilizing the ID of the parent as the tie
   breaker.

   Rbridges are described in RBRIDGE [2].  Tie breaking is described in
   section 2.2 (Spanning Tree).

   The Rbridges will run a level 1 or a single area routing protocol.
   The Rbridge specification RBRIDGE [2] suggests that the protocol be
   IS-IS due ease of adding TLVS and the NET ID (6 bytes) that
   identifies the node.  While ISIS may be easier, it is still possible
   to OSPF to pass information given more modifications to OSPF.

   To forward multicast packets, the Rbridges may treat these as
   broadcast (sending the packets to all Rbridges) or use methods to
   snoop the Multicast MAC addresses (GARP GMRP or MAC learning) or IP/
   MAC address packets (IGMP/PIM snooping), or ARP/ND replies.

   The Rbridge must support multiple VLANs and traffic engineering to
   support Layer 2 forwarding based on traffic engineered paths
   (802.11e, 802.1 P bit and Q bits).

   These constraints placed on the routing calculations for the Rbridge
   are exactly the constraints placed on two previous protocols: MOSPF
   and 802.11s Wireless mesh.  This document suggests a Hybrid Link
   State Rbridge Protocol based on the work for 802.11s Wireless Mesh
   that is in turned based on the earlier work in MOSPF.

   MOSPF RFC 1584 [3].created source based trees rooted at the datagram
   source.  The MOSPF routers collected information about requests for
   nodes to receive multicast group traffice.  The MOSPF protocol
   calculated the shortest path from the source to the destinations.
   MOSPF did not support Equal-Cost Multi-path.  It select a single link
   for multiast traffic, just as the Rbridge work suggests.

   The Hybrid Link State Protocol Wi-Mesh 802.11s Proposal: Hybrid Link
   State Protocol [6], part of Wi-Mesh Alliance submission for 802.11s,
   suggests allowing three options for the multicast trees:

      Flooding Trees based on detection of a MAC Group Address detected

      Reduced flooding trees to Rbridges that support Multicast

   Todays layer 2 bridges are often highly meshed within a campus area.
   Bridges may be support WLANs (802.11) or Wired LANs (802.3 or
   Ethernet).  The reducing of flooding trees may allow needless
   flooding of multicast packets between Rbridges.  The Reduced flooding
   tree methods from OSLR or OSPF MANET can be used in general multicast
   flooding algorithsm to reduce the cost of forwarding data.  This
   document suggest allowing Rbridges to be able to negotiate Flooding
   reduction algorithms as well as Traffic Engineering paths.

   A reduced flooding algorithm may be useful for two reason The Layer 2

3.  Multicast Algorithms

   Rbridges must learn about Multicast pathways request by learning
   about frames destined to a Group MAC address from a Source MAC
   address.  The Rbridges must create a forwarding database structure to
   support forwarding behavior required by the Rbridge.

   Section 4.1 contains information about the Forwarding path for
   Rbridges.  The next three section contain information about the
   multicast tree calculations

      4.2- Tree rooted at MAC source addreses per Destination MAC
      address

      4.3 - Flooding Trees based on detection of a MAC Group Address
      detected an an Rbrdige

      4.4 - Reduced flooding trees to Rbridges that support Multicast

3.1.  Forwarding Database for Rbridges

   The Rbridge RBRIDGE [2] contains information on Forwarding Behavior
   and Forwarding headers

   The first step to defining how a Multicast algorithsm can work to
   support Multicast pathways through Rbridges is by defining the inputs
   and outputs.  The inputs are:

   1.  Rbridge topology - Bridges, Links and Designate Rbridges

   2.  Source-Group (S,G) MAC address pairs associated per Rbridge

   3.  (*,G) MAC pairs associated per Rbridge

   4.  IP Multicast (S,G) to (S,G) mappings

   5.  Single Path Selection weights

   The outputs are:

   1.  Destination Multicast MAC to Rbridge(s) mapping

   2.  Source Code MAC to Rbridge mapping

   3.  Encapsulation Table for traffic Destined for Rbridge

   4.  Forwarding Table for Encapsulated traffic to Rbridge(s)

   Rbridge Topolology The Rbridge topology borrows from the ISIS router
      topology for Bridges but must be extended to support:

      1.  Hello information to indicated Flags for support Router has.
          In a similar manner, the ISIS hello must be extended to
          indicate support for:

             Multicast Forwarding,

             Multicast Reduced Flooding algorithms

             Multicast Path Weights

      2.  Link information must include:

             Rbridge link Metric

             Traffic Engineering link metrics - both radio and wired

             Multicast support - broadcast, multicast by unicast
             replication, or other

      3.  Number of topology (default, VLAN Based)

      4.  Designated RBridge per link

   (S,G) MAC state: the Rbridge needs to indicate keep a table of Source
      MAC, Group MAC pairs associated with each Rbridge.

         The Destinated Ingress Rbridge will learn these pairs from the
         endnodes associated with the Rbridge.

         The Designated Rbridge will send this state in TLVs passed to
         other Rbridges.  The ISIS flooding algorithm will be used to
         distribute the (S,G) MAC information.

   (*,G) MAC state: the Rbridge should also be able to passing Support
      for flooding to all Rbridges Multicast traffic from any source.
      The (*,G) MAC state can be used for a reduced flooding to a
      limited set of Rbridges.

   IP (S,G) Mappings to MAC (S,G): the Rbridge should keep a set of
      mappings from IP (S,G) to MAC (S,G) in order to aid the ARP
      processing.

   Singe Path Weights: The Tie breaker mechanisms may be tuned by
      allowing common single path weights per VLAN so that alternative
      single path calculations may be optionally used.  The default tie-
      breaker would be required to be supported.

   Note: Since the Rbridge topology cannot make use of equal-cost-multi-
   path links, it would be good to combine the links into bundled links
   and utilize traffic engineer capabilities within that link.

3.1.1.  Output: Forwarding Database for Rbridges

   The Multicast Algorithms need to take the input and create the
   forwarding state per VLAN, per Traffic-Engineering layer 2 overlayin.

   1.  Flooding Information via Link State

   2.  Sorting (S,G,Rbridge) into S-[G-sets,Rbridges-set]

   3.  Calculating a multicast forwarding tree based in the source for
       S-[G-Sets,Rbridge

   1.  The Flooding of information via the link state should include the
       following information about MAC Addresses:


         TLV sent from originating Rbridge
         =====================================
         TLV1: Source MAC address
         -------------------------------------
         Source MAC Address IDentifier
         Count of Unicast Source MAC Addresses
         Source MAC 1  [Flag Add/Delete, Encrypted/None]
         Source MAC 2
         Source MAC n
         [count of Group MACs associated with Source set]
         [MAC Group Identifier - number]

         TLV2: Group MAC set
         ---------------------------
         Count of Multicast MAC addresses
         Group MAC Address-1 [6 bytes][ Flag byte -Add/Delete, Encrypt/None]
         Group MAC Address-2
         ...
         Group MAC Address -n
         [count of Groups of Source MAC adddresses Associted with Group]
         [Source MAC Identifiers]

       Figure 2: TLVs for MAC flooding

   2.  Sorting (S,G,Rbridge) into [S, G-Sets] [G-sets,Rbridges-set]

          This part of the calculation tries to reduce the (S,G,Rbridge)
          source tree to all destination MAC Address and Rbridge
          calculations.

          Each Rbridge has received them mappings between (S,G,Rbridge)
          pairs from the above TLVs.  After storing the original link
          state information in the ISIS LSDB, the Rbridge needs to sort
          information around this calculation framework: Sources going
          to the same Groups, a "Group-Set".  For these sources, the
          calculation to the Groups can be summarized into a "Source-
          set".

Internet-Draft             TRILL-Multicast-LS               October 2005


          For each group set, the groups will be listed on a a set of
          Rbridges.  If the multiple groups share the same group sets,
          the Group set can be summarized into a "Rbridge-Group-set".

          Map the Source Address to a Rbridge and see if any further
          reduction by combining Source Addresses to Rbridge can be made
          of the Source-Rbridge-set each with a G-Destination-Rbridge-
          Group-Set.

          The results (Source-Rbridge-set, G-Destination-Rbridge-Group-
          set) is passed to the next stage.

   3.  For each Source-Rbridge-Set calculate the spanning tree for each
       G-Destination-Rbridge-Group Set. Store the Resulting Entries in
       the forwarding state as {S-MAC, G-MAC] state.  Use the Path tie
       entries to set the forwarding tree state to a single path.

3.3.  S,G Multicast Tree Calculation to all G-Group MACs

   The Group MAC address calculation can be used for a smaller number of
   Rbridges with only some of the Rbridges supporting the Destination
   MAC Addresses.

   In this calcualtion, the source tree is calculated form each Ingress
   Rbridge to the Group MAC Destination learned at each Rbridge.  The
   benefit of this calculation is that only Group MAC addresses need to
   be passed around and no (S,G) calculation is completed.

   The mechanism has three parts:

   1.  Flooding Information via Link State

   2.  Sorting the (Group-MAC-set,Rbridge> into Rbridge-(*,G)sets that
       share the same Group-MAC-Sets

   3.  Calculating a multicast forwarding tree from each Rbridge to the
       Rbridge-(*,G)sets

   4.  Updating the forwarding table with the results

   1.  The Flooding of information via the link state should include the
       following information about MAC Addresses:

         TLV sent from originating Rbridge
         =====================================
         TLV2: Group MAC set
         ---------------------------
         Count of Multicast MAC addresses
         Group MAC Address-1 [6 bytes][ Flag byte -Add/Delete, Encrypt/None]
         Group MAC Address-2
         ...
         Group MAC Address -n
         [count of Groups of Source MAC adddresses Associted with Group]
         [Source MAC Identifiers]

       Figure 3: Defitions for TLV for MAC flooding

   2.  Sort the (Group-Set,originating RBridge) into (*,G) Group sets
       that share the same set of Rbridges.

          (For example, four (*,g) group sets could be found only on
          Rbridges 1,2,3, and 4.  The calculation for these two group
          sets sets can be done at the same time.)

   3.  For each Source-Rbridge calculate the spanning tree for each
       Rbridges for the (*,G) group sets.  Use the path tie-break
       entries to set the forwarding state to 1 path.

   4.  Store the Resulting Entries in the forwarding state as {S-MAC,
       G-MAC] state.

3.4.  Reduced Flooding Trees for all Rbridges supporting multicast

   The third algorithm for calculating multicast state is to simply
   calculate a more efficient broadcast flood.  The MANET and OSPF MANET
   work has started to look at ways to reduced the Link state
   announcements that are sent over and over.

   The first step in this method is to determine what Rbridges will
   support Multicast forwarding.  If nodes do not support multicast
   flooding, the nodes are cut out of the calculation tree.

   Reduction of flooding of multicast frames may utilize the similar
   methods that calculate the minimum routers that need to flood Link
   State Advertisements.  All routers send ACKs for the information
   received - but the repeat ACK require less bandwidth than the data.

      The OLSR RFC 3626 [7] MPR sets that announced to the other
      routers.

4.  Multicast Rbridge Cross Algorithm Aids

      This section covers algorithms that will span across multiple
      multicast algorithms.

      Alternative Tie-Break: The addition tie breaking algorithms can
         be:

            Negotiated on the ISIS Hello

            Passed as TLVs indicating weights to select a group leader
            Rbridge that will form the root of the spanning tree

      Logical Links: Logical links provide a natural bundling of
         existing links into larger calculations.  The link bundling is
         supported by many ISIS implementations.  Use of a "logical
         link" identifier or a L2 Logical Link ID (6 bytes) to identify
         the logical link bundle.

      Negotiating of Reduced flooding a mechanism to negotiate the flood
         algorithms between bridge is needed for the a non-configured
         selection of flooding algorithms.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security of the Rbridge exchange depends on the factors:

      IS-IS protocol security

      Encryption of MAC traffic on a hop-by-hop basis.  Wireless LANs
      will utilized encrypted traffic.  Some wired traffic may be
      encrupted.

   This proposal does not change the security implications pre-existing
   in these protocols.
