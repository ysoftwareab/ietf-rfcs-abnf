1.  Introduction

   This specification describes a means for storing [X.660] registration
   and contextual within an LDAP [RFC4510] implementation.

1.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in
   all capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Intended Audience

   This specification is intended for use by any entity or individual in
   need of a means for storing and serving [X.660] data, in whole or in
   part.

1.3.  Limitations

   Some design decisions set forth in this document tend to favor a more
   generalized implementation as opposed to a strict adherence to all of
   the precepts defined in [X.660].

   One obvious example of this relates to the lack of enforcement of the
   use (or non-use) of Unicode values during attribute value assignment.
   While Unicode values are supported where expected, this specification
   provides no such enforcement.

1.4.  OIDs Used in this Document

   This specification provides a registered OID for LDAP schema elements
   as defined in Section 2.

     - 1.3.6.1.4.1.56521 (author root)

     - 1.3.6.1.4.1.56521.101 (specification OID)

     - 1.3.6.1.4.1.56521.101.1 (schema OID)

     - 1.3.6.1.4.1.56521.101.1.1 (attribute types OID)

     - 1.3.6.1.4.1.56521.101.1.2 (object classes OID)

1.5.  Acronyms Used in this Document

   DN  Distinguished Name
   RDN  Relative Distinguished Name
   DUA  Directory User Agent (an LDAP client)
   DIT  Directory Information Tree
   OID  (ASN.1) Object Identifier
   LDAP  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   ASN.1  Abstract Syntax Notation v1

2.  Schema Definitions

   This section discusses the particulars of the LDAP schema definitions
   made available through this specification.

   These schema definitions described in this section are provided using
   LDAP description formats [RFC4512].  These elements are line-wrapped
   and indented for readability.

               arcAddlSecId ) )

2.2.2.  x660ArcEntry

   The x660ArcEntry object class makes a collection of attribute types
   available for use when crafting non-root arc entries within a DIT.

         NAME 'x660ArcEntry'
         DESC 'A generalized class meant to represent subordinate arcs

         STRUCTURAL
         MUST ( arc )
         MAY ( arcAddlSecId $ arcData $ arcOID $ arcSecId $ arcId $
               arcAuthority $ arcSponsor $ arcContact $ labeledURI $
               arcDescription $ arcTitle ) )

3.  Directory Models

   This specification offers two (2) distinct models by which directory
   architects and application developers SHOULD be guided during their
   efforts for implementation.

3.1.  Naming Context and Organization Entries

   In these examples, a naming context of "dc=example, dc=com" is used
   as the fictional "suffix".  Within this suffix are two (2) entries:

     - "ou=X660, dc=example, dc=com" - Storage of all arc registration
       entries.

     - "ou=Registrants, dc=example, dc=com" - Storage of all arc
       contact, authority and sponsorship entries.

   Directory architects MAY choose to use models of their own design, so
   long as noted requirements in the following sections are satisfied.

3.2.  Two-Dimensional Model

   This model suggests that arc registration entries reside as siblings
   within an LDAP DIT in singular, non-hierarchical locations.

Coretta                   Expires July 4, 2021                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        X.660 LDAP Schema and Models         December 2020


3.2.1.  Requirements

   One requirement of this model is strict use of the arcOID attribute
   type, covered in Section 2.1.2.  This attribute MUST be used on all
   non-root arc registration entries.

   Root arc registration entries SHALL NOT bear an arcOID value, as the
   syntax for OIDs (see Section 3.3.26 of [RFC4517]) requires at least
   two (2) nodes in a given value.

   Uniqueness of arcOID values within a directory structure MUST always
   be enforced to ensure unambiguous results.  The simplest way to meet
   this requirement would be to adopt arcOID-based DN structure as shown
   in the next section.

3.2.2.  Distinguished Name Convention

   Because all LDAP search requests can be conducted using a "one-level
   scope" below the circumscribing directory branch, a hierarchical DN
   structure is unnecessary.  While the three-dimensional model (shown
   in Section 3.3) uses the integer-based arc attribute type (defined in
   Section 2.1.1) to form the effective LDAP RDN of an entry, it is not
   practical in this model.

   The most sensible convention for DN involves use of the arcOID
   attribute as shown:

     dn: arcOID=1.3,ou=X660,dc=example,dc=com
     objectClass: top
     objectClass: x660ArcEntry
     arc: 3
     arcId: Identified-Organization
     arcOID: 1.3

   Subsequent entries, regardless of hierarchical superiority, manifest
   as sibling entries.  For example, the addition of deeper arcs would
   be procedurally identical:

     dn: arcOID=1.3.6.1,ou=X660,dc=example,dc=com
     objectClass: top
     objectClass: x660ArcEntry
     arc: 1
     arcId: internet
     arcOID: 1.3.6.1

3.3.  Three-Dimensional Model

   This model is hierarchical by nature, providing a means for storing
   arc registration entries in "nested" fashion, thereby reflecting the
   hierarchy of the [X.660] specification itself.

Internet-Draft        X.660 LDAP Schema and Models         December 2020


3.3.1.  Requirements

   In this model, interim arc registrations MUST exist even if they are
   otherwise unnecessary.

   For example, in order to add the well-known arc "internet" (OID:
   1.3.6.1, [RFC1155]), directory administrators MUST ensure these
   registrations exist beforehand:

     dn: arc=1,ou=X660,dc=example,dc=com
     objectClass: top
     objectClass: x660RootArcEntry
     arc: 1
     arcId: ISO

     dn: arc=3,arc=1,ou=X660,dc=example,dc=com
     objectClass: top
     objectClass: x660ArcEntry
     arc: 3
     arcId: Identified-Organization

     dn: arc=6,arc=3,arc=1,ou=X660,dc=example,dc=com
     objectClass: top
     objectClass: x660ArcEntry
     arc: 6
     arcId: dod

   Only once this requirement is satisfied would the administrators be
   able to create the desired registration, such as a registration
   entry for the "internet" OID, as shown in [RFC1155]:

     dn: arc=1,arc=6,arc=3,arc=1,ou=X660,dc=example,dc=com
     objectClass: top
     objectClass: x660ArcEntry
     arc: 1
     arcId: internet

3.3.2.  Distinguished Name Convention

   Under a strict interpretation of this model, its implementation will
   provide a means for bidirectional resolution of registered arc OIDs.
   LDAP DNs can be deduced from OIDs, and vice versa.

   This is achieved by using the arc attribute type (as discussed in
   Section 2.1.1) as components in the effective LDAP DN, but in reverse
   order to reflect the directory hierarchy.

   For example: the "internet" arc (OID: 1.3.6.1) would exist as an
   entry with a DN as depicted below:

Internet-Draft        X.660 LDAP Schema and Models         December 2020


     dn: arc=1, arc=6, arc=3, arc=1, ou=X660, dc=example, dc=com
             |      |      |      |
             ----------------------
                    1.3.6.1

3.3.3.  Root Arc Entries

   A maximum of three (3) root arcs SHOULD exist within the directory
   landscape.  If one or more are created, they MUST be identifiable
   as follows:

     - ITU-T (0)

     - ISO (1)

     - Joint-ISO-ITU-T (2)

   As sibling entries, these root arcs MUST use the x660RootArcEntry
   class, as shown in Section 2.2.1:

     dn: arc=0,ou=X660,dc=example,dc=com
     objectClass: top
     objectClass: x660RootArcEntry
     arc: 0
     arcId: ITU-T

     dn: arc=1,ou=X660,dc=example,dc=com
     objectClass: top
     objectClass: x660RootArcEntry
     arc: 1
     arcId: ISO

     dn: arc=2,ou=X660,dc=example,dc=com
     objectClass: top
     objectClass: x660RootArcEntry
     arc: 2
     arcId: Joint-ISO-ITU-T

   Depending on the breadth and scope of an implementation, creation and
   use of root arc registration entries is RECOMMENDED, but not required
   in all situations.

3.4.  Arc Authority, Sponsorship and Contact Info

   Directory architects MAY choose to store authoritative, sponsorship
   or generalized contact information in one of two main ways:

     - Use of an AUXILIARY object class [RFC4512] to facilitate the
       addition of any desired supplemental attribute types directly
       to a given instance of x660RootArcEntry or x660ArcEntry, or ...



Coretta                   Expires July 4, 2021                 [Page 10]

Internet-Draft        X.660 LDAP Schema and Models         December 2020


     - Use of independent arc registration contact entries, which are
       referenced via LDAP DN through one or more of: arcAuthority,
       arcContact and/or arcSponsor attribute types assigned directly
       to a given instance of x660RootArcEntry or x660ArcEntry

   For compatibility reasons, it is RECOMMENDED that only [RFC4519]
   attribute types be used to detail contact, authority or sponsorship
   information.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document focuses on providing flexible directory models and LDAP
   schema elements in order to serve arc registration data, and to allow
   an LDAP-based means for OID resolution, either within an organization
   or within the context of personal use.  If some or all of the data in
   the directory is sensitive in nature, directory architects MUST take
   appropriate steps to secure this information.  This concept is out of
   scope for this document.

   Beyond this, there are no specific concerns in the area of security.
