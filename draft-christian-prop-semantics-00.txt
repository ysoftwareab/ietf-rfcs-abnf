2. Abstract

    This document specifies a mechanism to associate a WebDAV ([WEBDAV]) 
    property with an entry in a Semantics Register. A Semantics Register 
    documents the meaning of properties in a formal manner and may be 
    implemented with schema technologies such as Extensible Markup 
    Language (XML) Schema ([XMLSCHEMA]) or Resource Description Framework
    (RDF) Schema ([RDFS]). Schema technologies expose the derivation of 
    complex properties from simpler concepts, as demonstrated in the Basic 
    Semantics Register ([BSR]) for data elements used in Electronic Data 
    Interchange. Registering the meanings of properties in this manner can 
    enhance interoperability across systems and throughout the long-term 
    information life cycle. 

3. Introduction

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
    document are to be interpreted as described in [MUSTS] .

    This document specifies how a WebDAV ([WEBDAV]) property can be 
    associated with an entry in a Semantics Register.  The Semantics 
    Register may be implemented with schema technologies such as XML 
    Schema ([XMLSCHEMA]), Resource Description Framework RDF) Schema, 
    and perhaps others that use the XML Namespaces [XMLNS] mechanism.

INTERNET-DRAFT       Semantics Register with WebDAV       April 24, 2000

    WebDAV defines a protocol for manipulating the contents of properties
    in a Web object instance.  Each such property is referenced in WebDAV
    by a name that is unique within a specific namespace.

    It is often important to associate with a property some assertions 
    in addition to its name and contents: assertions such as alternate 
    labels or the property's semantic or syntactic relationship to other 
    properties in the same or other systems.  In organizing these 
    assertions, a Semantics Register serves as an important tool for 
    documenting a system and enabling interoperability among systems.
  
    When implemented with schema technologies, a Semantics Register can 
    expose how complex properties are derived from simpler concepts. 
    This use is demonstrated in the Basic Semantics Register ([BSR]), 
    wherein thousands of complex data elements used in Electronic Data 
    Interchange are constructed from commonly understood concepts.

4. Semantics Register referenced through a WebDAV Namespace

    A Semantics Register can be referenced within WebDAV through the 
    XML Namespace ([XMLNS]) attribute. For example, assume there is a 
    Semantics Register for Open Document Management ([ODMA]) properties  
    at the URI "http://www.semantics.org/reg/odm.rdfs", and one of the 
    ODM properties has an attribute ID "ODM_CHECKEDOUTBY". This 
    hypothetical Semantics Register can be referenced in the value of an 
    "xmlns" attribute on the "prop" element of a WebDAV "propfind", e.g.,

       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
       <D:propfind xmlns:D="DAV:">
          <D:prop xmlns:odm="http://www.semantics.org/reg/odm.rdfs">
             <odm:ODM_CHECKEDOUTBY/>
          </D:prop>
       </D:propfind>

5. Example Semantics Register

    On the Web, a simple Semantics Register can be implemented using XML 
    Schema ([XMLSCHEMA])or RDF Schema ([RDFS]). For semantic concepts 
    and data elements, XML Schema employs "Types" and "Elements" where 
    RDF Schema employs "Classes" and "Properties". Relationships among 
    these can be defined in either schema technology, so that complex 
    entities can be formally defined as comprised of simpler entities.
    
    In the RDF Schema technology, every Class or Property is defined by 
    an "RDF Description". A particular WebDAV property can be associated 
    with a particular RDF Description by matching the WebDAV property 
    name with the ID attribute of the RDF Description.  From the example 
    above, the WebDAV property name "odm:ODM_CHECKEDOUTBY" may correspond
    to this RDF Description entry in the hypothetical Semantics Register:

INTERNET-DRAFT       Semantics Register with WebDAV       April 24, 2000

       <rdf:Description rdf:ID="ODM_CHECKEDOUTBY">
            <rdfs:comment>Username of the person who has the document 
                          checked-out.</rdfs:comment>
       </rdf:Description>

    Each RDF Description in a schema referenced by a WebDAV namespace 
    can contain various assertions about the WebDAV property.  These 
    assertions are expressed as RDF Schema elements and attributes.  
    Assertions about the WebDAV property include label, subClassOf, 
    subPropertyOf, domain, range, comment, and isDefinedBy, among others. 
    Here, for example, is a fuller entry for the ODM_CHECKEDOUTBY
    property as it might exist in the hypothetical Semantics Register:

       <rdf:Description rdf:ID="ODM_CHECKEDOUTBY">
            <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/
                                    PR-rdf-schema-19990303#Property"/>
            <rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource="#person"/>
            <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#ODM"/>
            <rdfs:range rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/
                                      xmlschema-2/#string"/>
            <rdfs:comment>Username of the person who has the document 
                          checked-out.</rdfs:comment>
       </rdf:Description>

6. Internationalization Considerations

    The international considerations of the mechanism to associate a 
    WebDAV property with an entry in a Semantics Register are affected 
    by both WebDAV and the specific Semantics Register technology used. 
    WebDAV uses XML ([XML]) and inherits the relatively robust support in
    XML for internationalization. The only Semantics Register technology 
    discussed here is the RDF Schema specification, which also uses XML.

7. Security Considerations

    The mechanism to associate WebDAV properties with a Semantics 
    Register does not itself affect security. Any security considerations
    are a function of WebDAV technology and the specific Semantics 
    Register technology.  When implemented using Internet protocols and 
    data representation techniques, both technologies inherit the 
    security characteristics of those protocols and techniques.

8. IANA Considerations

    The mechanism to associate WebDAV properties with a Semantics 
    Register does not itself introduce any new IANA considerations.  
    It makes use of namespaces as they may be defined for WebDAV and for 
    any particular Semantics Registry technology such as RDF Schema.
