            Multi-domain Service Function Chaining with ALTO
                 draft-lachos-multi-domain-sfc-alto-00

Abstract

   Currently, Service Function Chaining (SFC) that span domains with
   different technology, administration or ownership are being defined
   by the SFC WG.  This document focuses on how the Application Layer
   Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol can be used to advertise and
   discover abstract topology, resource and service information from
   different domains, and then compute inter-domain service function
   paths.  Another important concern of this draft is to initiate a
   discussion (ALTO, SFC as well as other WGs) regarding if, how, and
   under what conditions ALTO can be useful to improve the multi-domain
   SFC process.

1.  Introduction

   The delivery of end-to-end services often requires various Service
   functions (SFs) or Virtual Network Functions (VNFs).  Service
   Function Chaining (SFC) is constructed as an abstract sequence of SFs
   or VNFs [RFC7665].  Multi-domain SFC is the ability to deploy SFC
   across multiple domains with different technology and/or

   administration.  To do so, an inter-domain communication process
   between different organizations is necessary to (i) exchange
   topology, resource and service information, and then (ii) compute
   inter-domain service function paths.

   The ALTO WG has begun started to discuss the uses of ALTO as an
   information model for representing network resource and services in
   multi-domain scenarios:

   o  [DRAFT-ALTO-BROKER-MDO] proposes an ALTO-based Broker-assisted
      architecture where a broker plane works as a coordinator between a
      set of top-level control planes, i.e., Multi-domain Orchestrator
      (MdOs).  The ALTO services (with the proposed extensions) provides
      abstract maps with a simplified, yet enough information view about
      MdOs involved in the federation.  This information includes the
      abstract network topology, resource availability (e.g., CPUs,
      Memory, and Storage) and capabilities (e.g., supported network
      functions).

   o  The document [DRAFT-ALTO-UNICORN] presents Unicorn, a resource
      orchestration framework for multi-domain, geo-distributed data
      analytics.  This work resorts in ALTO as the information model to
      support the accurate, yet privacy-preserving resource discovery
      across different domains.  The key information to be provided by
      the use of ALTO including different types of resources, e.g., the
      computing, storage, and networking resources.

   This draft offers concrete use case examples of how ALTO can be
   incorporated in the multi-domain SFC architecture.  The examples used
   in this document are based on architectures and assumptions currently
   being discussed in the SFC WG [DRAFT-HH-MDSFC] and in the ALTO WG
   [DRAFT-ALTO-BROKER-MDO] [DRAFT-ALTO-UNICORN].

   The overall rationale of this document is to begin a discussion
   between the SFC and the ALTO WG (other WGs are welcome) concerning
   if, how, and under which conditions ALTO will be helpful in the SFC
   traversing different administrative domains.

2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the terminology defined in
   [DRAFT-HH-MDSFC], [DRAFT-ALTO-UNICORN], and [DRAFT-ALTO-BROKER-MDO].

3.  Context and Motivation

   Nowadays, different standardization activities (e.g., IETF and ETSI)
   and research projects (e.g., 5GEx [H2020.5GEX], 5G-Transformer




Lachos, et al.           Expires January 3, 2019                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         Multi-domain SFC with ALTO              July 2018


   [H2020-5G-TRANSFORMER], T-NOVA [T-NOVA], etc.) have been focused on
   multi-domain network service chaining.

3.1.  Standardization Activities

   SFC that span domains owned by multiple administrative entities are
   being discussed in the IETF SFC WG.  [DRAFT-HH-MDSFC], for example,
   describes SFC crossing different domains owned by various
   organizations (e.g., ISPs) or by a single organization with
   administration partitions.  The proposed architecture uses a SFC
   eXchange Platform (SXP) to collect and exchange information
   (topology, service states, policies, etc.) between different
   organizations and it works both in centralized (Multiple SFC domains
   connected by a logical SXP) and distributed (SXP server as a broker)
   environments.  Another IETF initiative is the Network Function
   Virtualization Research Group (NFVRG).  The draft "Multi-domain
   Network Virtualization" [DRAFT-MD-VIRT] envisions a complete end-to-
   end logical network as stitching services offered by multiple domains
   from multiple providers.  It also points to the need for creating
   solutions that enable the exchange of relevant information (resources
   and topologies) across different providers.

   The ETSI NFV ISG is paving the way toward viable architectural
   options supporting the efficient placement of functions in different
   administrative domains.  More specifically, the document
   [ETSI-NFV-IFA028] reports different NFV MANO architectural approaches
   with use cases related to network services provided using multiple
   administrative domains.  Besides, it gives a non-exhaustive list of
   key information to be exchanged between administrative domains
   (monitoring parameters, topology view, resource capabilities, etc.)
   and recommendations related to security to permit the correct and
   proper operation of the final service.

3.2.  Research projects

   Several projects include an architectural model integrating NFV
   management with SDN control capabilities to address the challenges
   towards flexible, dynamic, cost-effective, and on-demand service
   chaining.

   [H2020.5GEX] aims to integrate multiple administrations and
   technologies through the collaboration between operators in the
   context of emerging 5G networking.  [VITAL][T-NOVA] follow a
   centralized approach where each domain advertises its capabilities to
   a federation layer which will act as a broker.  In order to avoid one
   network operator per country or regions, [H2020-5G-NORMA] proposes
   the use of management and control into a single virtual domain.
   Also, the 5G-Transformer project [H2020-5G-TRANSFORMER] is defining

   flexible slicing and federation of transport networking and computing
   resources across multiple domains.

4.  ALTO for Multi-domain SFC

   A "dialogue" between potential domains that will provide multi-domain
   SFC could be beneficial for more efficient use of resources and
   increasing the SFC performance.  However, constrained knowledge of
   the network services and underlying network topology based only on
   localized views from the point of view of a single domain limits the
   potential and scope for multi-domain SFC.

   To enable a highly customized multi-domains SFC, [DRAFT-HH-MDSFC]
   proposes a SFC eXchange Platform to realize inter-domain
   communication between top-level control planes.  The SXP is a logical
   entity deployed in future Software-defined IXP (as a trusted third-
   party platform) or built by a single owner between different
   networks.

   On a high level, the scope of the SXP contains two main tasks:

   o  Provide end-to-end visibility through the collection of topology
      information, service states, and policies from different domains.

   o  Compute inter-domain service function path to select the service
      function location from multiple candidate domains.

   The ALTO protocol [RFC7285] provides abstract network information in
   the form of map services that can be consumed by applications in
   order to become network-aware and to take optimized decisions
   regarding traffic flows.  Recently, ALTO is also being considered in
   multi-domain orchestration scenarios [DRAFT-ALTO-UNICORN]
   [DRAFT-ALTO-BROKER-MDO], in which an ALTO server can convey inter-
   domain network resource and topology information.

   In this context, the SXP can take advantage of multi-domain ALTO
   services to obtain important inter-domain information to "guide" the
   resource/service provider selection process in that the "best" domain
   or candidate domains (according to established policies) can be
   intelligently selected.  The following ALTO services can be
   identified:

4.1.  Advantages of using ALTO

   ALTO (and customized ALTO extensions) can be used to offer
   aggregated/abstracted views on various types of information including
   domain-level topology, storage resources, computation resources,
   networking resources and PNF/VNF capabilities.  This generic

   representation contributing to a more simple and scalable solution
   for resource and service discovery in multi-domain, multi-technology
   environments.

   In case of Multi-domain SFC, the following ALTO services could be
   identified:

4.1.1.  Inter-domain info discovery with ALTO Property Map

   Each domain needs a global view of other potential candidate domains
   to know who can provide part of the NF in the SFC.  A brief list of
   information to be exchanged between different domains includes:

   o  Resource capabilities, applicable to both IT (computing and
      storage) and networking resources participant of the multi-domain
      SFC, to assist on the decision of SFs placement.

   o  Access information (e.g., URL) to the orchestrator entry points
      and Service Access Points (SAPs) for a corresponding network/
      domain.

   The ALTO Property Map Service [DRAFT-ALTO-PM] can provide a clear
   global view of the resource information offered by other domains.
   This information allows discovering which candidate domains may be
   contacted to deliver the remaining requirements of a requested end-
   to-end service deployment.

4.1.2.  Inter-domain path computation with ALTO Cost Map

   Once the candidate domains are discovered, it is necessary to compute
   inter-domain service function path to select the service function
   location from those different candidate domains.

   The connectivity information among discovered domains can be
   retrieved by an ALTO Cost Map service, responding, for instance, a
   path vector with the AS-level topology distance between the source
   domain and candidate domains.  Moreover, path vector constraints (as
   described in the Multi-Cost Map [RFC8189]) can be applied to filter
   out the list of unqualified domains.

   In case of the Hybrid Hierarchical SFC architecture [DRAFT-HH-MDSFC],
   the SXP (or the Path Calculation Element in the top-level control
   plane) could use this information to compute multi-domain service
   function paths.

5.  Motivating Use Cases

5.1.  ALTO as part of the SFC eXchange Platform

   As mentioned earlier, the draft [DRAFT-HH-MDSFC] defines a multi-
   domain SFC architecture that combines control planes to be deployed
   either into a large domain consisting of smaller sub-domains owned by
   the same organization or into multiple large domains with different
   ownership.  Figure 1 shows a SXP connecting three different domains
   (AS1, AS2, AS3).  Each domain provides different SFs: AS1 -> SF1; AS2
   -> SF2 and SF3; AS3 -> SF3.  The SXP includes an ALTO server
   component to provide abstract topology, resource, and service
   information for the high-level control plane in each domain.

   used by the ALTO server to create two different ALTO Map Services:
   (i) Property Map and (ii) Cost Map.

   The Property Map includes a property value grouped by Autonomous
   System (AS), this value contains the supported network functions.
   Additional properties could be considered such as resource
   availability (e.g., CPUs, Memory, and Storage), orchestrator entry
   points, etc.  An example of the Property Map in our basic scenario
   is:

     | AS3 | {SF3}        | http://...  | ... | ... | ...     | ... |
     +-----+--------------+-------------+-----+-----+---------+-----+

                        Table 1: ALTO Property Map

   The Cost Map defines a path vector as an array of ASes, representing
   the AS-level topological distance for a given SFC request.  Table 2
   below shows a brief example of a service request and its inter-domain
   service function path response containing a list of potential domains
   to be traversed to deliver such service.

5.2.  Resource Orchestration for Multi-Domain, Geo-Distributed Data
      Analytics

   In addition to commercial SFC, ALTO is also used as a core
   information model for collaborative data science networks.  The
   document [DRAFT-ALTO-UNICORN] presents the design of Unicorn, a
   unified resource orchestration framework for multi-domain, geo-
   distributed data analytics, currently being developed and deployed in
   the CMS network, one of the largest scientific experiments in the LHC
   network.

   ALTO is well suited as a fundamental component in Unicorn for
   providing a generic representation that (1) allows different types of

   data analytics jobs to accurately describe their resource
   requirements and (2) allows member networks to provide accurate
   information on different types of resources they own and at the same
   time maintain their privacies.

                    Figure 2: Architecture of Unicorn.

   Figure 2 presents the architecture of Unicorn.  Specifically, for
   each member network, one or more ALTO servers are deployed to provide
   accurate, yet privacy-preserving information of different types of
   resources owned by the corresponding network.  Examples of such
   information include the link bandwidth between endpoints, the memory
   I/O bandwidth and the CPU utilization at computing endpoints and the
   storage space at storage endpoints.  In addition to the basic ALTO
   services defined in [RFC7285], The ALTO servers in Unicorn also
   provide ALTO extension services such as the ALTO Multi-Cost Service
   [RFC8189], the ALTO Server-Sent Event Service [DRAFT-ALTO-INCR-UPD]
   and the ALTO Path Vector Service [DRAFT-ALTO-PV] to provide fine-
   grained resource information.

   Because the ALTO Path Vector service may expose additional private
   information of each network, Unicorn develops an obfuscating protocol

   which ensures that nor the orchestrator or any member networks can
   associate any path vector information with a corresponding network.

   To better address the scalability issue of multi-domain resource
   discovery, Unicorn also develops a proactive full-mesh discovery
   mechanism, which precomputes network-level ALTO path vector
   information and performs projection using such information to compute
   the fine-grained resource information in response to orchestrator's
   resource discovery requests.

   Details of the obfuscating protocol and the proactive full-mesh
   discovery mechanism developed in Unicorn can be found in the
   [DRAFT-ALTO-UNICORN] document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   The ALTO base protocol has an extensive discussion on potential
   security and privacy issues.  Using the ALTO base protocol to support
   multi-domain SFC will not raise new security and privacy issue.
   However, the information provided by the ALTO base protocol is
   considered coarse-grained in several recent use cases.  As a result,
   several ALTO extension services have been designed to provide fine-
   grained network information to the application.  Using these ALTO
   extension services for multi-domain SFC would raise new security and
   privacy concerns.  Next, we list these issues on a per extension
   basis.

   The ALTO unified property extension [DRAFT-ALTO-PM] generalizes the
   concept of endpoint properties to other entity domains, such as
   abstract network element.  The properties of these entities may
   contain sensitive service-function-specific information.  Exposing
   such information may discourage networks to provide fine-grained
   information to support multi-domain SFC.

   The ALTO performance cost metrics extension [DRAFT-ALTO-METRICS]
   proposes a set of ALTO cost metrics derived from traffic engineering
   tools and protocols.  It is stated in this extension that "sharing
   network TE metric values in numerical mode requires full mutual
   confidence between the entities managing the ALTO Server and Client."
   In multi-domain SFC use case, such mutual confidence is needed not
   only between ALTO server and client, but also among all networks, and
   third-parties such as broker and a global orchestrator.  How to
   achieve such mutual confidence in multi-domain SFC use case requires
   further investigation.

Internet-Draft         Multi-domain SFC with ALTO              July 2018


   The ALTO path vector extension [DRAFT-ALTO-PV] allows ALTO clients to
   query network information such as capacity region for a given set of
   flows.  Several related studies have shared concerns that this
   extension may reveal more network internal structures than the more
   abstract single-node abstraction used in the ALTO base protocol.  In
   multi-domain SFC, this concern will further be amplified as third-
   party participants may access such information.  The recent designed
   Unicorn system proposes an obfuscating protocol that prevents the
   receiver of the capacity region information from associating this
   region to any network.  This protocol sheds light for addressing the
   privacy issue brought by the ALTO path vector extension.

   The ALTO cost calendar [DRAFT-ALTO-CALENDAR] and the ALTO incremental
   update [DRAFT-ALTO-INCR-UPD] extensions allow the ALTO client to get
   temporal network information.  The intention of these extensions is
   to allow applications to make flexible decisions on when to use
   network information.  However, both extensions expose temporal policy
   and traffic information of network so that a user may know when the
   network is most vulnerable for overloading.  This issue needs to be
   carefully addressed in order for both extensions to be used for
   multi-domain SFC.

8.  Summary and Outlook

   This draft provided arguments why ALTO is a meaningful protocol in
   the context of SFC traversing different domains, and it presented use
   case examples about the how ALTO can be used to advertise and
   discover abstract topology, resource and service information from
   different domains, and then compute inter-domain service function
   paths.

   The overall objective of this document is to arouse discussions in
   the SFC WG in order to assess the suitability of the ALTO as a useful
   protocol for multi-domain SFC scenarios.  The result of such
   discussions will be captured in future versions of this draft.
