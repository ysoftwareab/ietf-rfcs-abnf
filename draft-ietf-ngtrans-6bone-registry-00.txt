Abstract

   This proposal describes the proposed syntax of a new RIPE database
   object that describes the several IPv6 sites in the world. The object
   and resulting database collection will be used to facilitate the
   introduction of IPv6 in the Internet.


Introduction

   This proposal describes the proposed syntax of a new RIPE database
   object that describes the several IPv6 sites in the world. The
   proposal has been extended for experimental use inside DNS. The
   object will be used to facilitate the introduction of IPv6 in the
   Internet. It is expected that the object will be superceded later
   (when the IPv6 routing protocols and the like are better standarized)
   by a new structure within the RPS [1] that is more genericly designed
   and less IPv6 dependant. It is expected that the RIPE database can

   get experimental support for this pretty quick after the RIPE
   database working group gives approval for such an experimental
   object. Syntax checking will explicitly not be made very strong to
   allow for easy changes to the format in our rapidly changing
   environment and to cut implementation time.

   The syntax is based on the experience with the 'ftp' object
   repository at the RIPE NCC created by Geert Jan de Groot and
   discussions on the 6bone mailing list. Any comments for changes
   and/or better wording are welcome.

   Several attribute name changes are made to the existing 'ftp' object
   to faciliate a better integration (and reuse of already existing
   attributes) in the RIPE database scheme.

   The now existing nearly-real time mirroring mechanism of the data
   allows for a fast distribution mechanism to other (mirror) databases
   in a topologically closer position to the database users. It is
   therefore proposed that this object can only be updated at the RIPE
   NCC database repository (for now). This avoids conflicting data in
   different databases problems as we have now with the IPv4 route and
   AS number objects.

   The proposed RIDE working group is currently defining an exchange
   format for communication between different Internet registries. This
   will facilitate other types of databases such as DNS that could be
   used instead for storing this data.

Formal RIPE database template:

   ipv6-site:      [mandatory] [single]
   descr:          [mandatory] [multiple]
   location:       [optional]  [multiple]
   country:        [optional]  [multiple]
   prefix:         [mandatory] [multiple]
   application:    [optional]  [multiple]
   tunnel:         [optional]  [multiple]
   contact:        [mandatory] [multiple]
   url:            [optional]  [multiple]
   remarks:        [optional]  [multiple]
   changed:        [mandatory] [multiple]
   source:         [mandatory] [single]

   The object could be stored in DNS TXT records using the following
   syntax:

   TXT "[optional white space]<line number><white space>tag:[optional white
        space]<value>"

Draft                       IPv6 site object                  March 1997


   Description and purpose of the attributes:


   ipv6-site:   <SiteTag>

      SiteTag is a short unique tag for the IPv6 site to be used for
      lookups and referrals of the object.

      Syntax:

      /^[A-Z][A-Z-]*[A-Z]$/

      Example:

      ipv6-site: ISI


   descr:  <SiteDescr>

      Multiple line attribute that describes the site. This attribute
      usually contains information about the location of the IPv6 site
      and a full name of the site.

      Syntax:

      /^.*$/

      Example:

      descr: ISI/USC, descr: Los Angeles


   location: <LocatianString>

      LocationString contains the coordinates of the IPv6 sites
      location. Multiple location strings can be provided on different
      lines for sites that have multiple locations in the area. One can
      use a domainname instead of LocationString if an RFC1876 LOC
      record is present in DNS.

      Note that this attribute is unnecessary for DNS based databases
      since DNS already has support for special location (LOC) records
      (see RFC1876).

      Syntax:

      Full syntax is described in RFC1876. A summary follows below:

      3. Master File Format

      The LOC record is expressed in a master file in the following
      format:

      <owner> <TTL> <class> LOC ( d1 [m1 [s1]] {"N"|"S"} d2 [m2 [s2]]
                                  {"E"|"W"} alt["m"] [siz["m"] [hp["m"]
                                  [vp["m"]]]] )

      (The parentheses are used for multi-line data as specified in [RFC
      1035] section 5.1.)

      where:

         d1:     [0 .. 90]            (degrees latitude)
         d2:     [0 .. 180]           (degrees longitude)
         m1, m2: [0 .. 59]            (minutes latitude/longitude)
         s1, s2: [0 .. 59.999]        (seconds latitude/longitude)
         alt:    [-100000.00 .. 42849672.95] BY .01 (altitude in meters)
         siz, hp, vp: [0 .. 90000000.00] (size/precision in meters)

      If omitted, minutes and seconds default to zero, size defaults to
      1m, horizontal precision defaults to 10000m, and vertical
      precision defaults to 10m.  These defaults are chosen to represent
      typical ZIP/postal code area sizes, since it is often easy to find
      approximate geographical location by ZIP/postal code.

   country: <ISO3166-country code> ...

      Specify here the country codes of the countries where your site is
      located.

      Example:

      country: US

      or

      country: DK SE


   prefix: <IPv6Prefix>

      IPv6Prefix is a prefix that is used within the the IPv6 site.

      Syntax:

      <ValidIPv6Address/0-128>

      Example:

      prefix:         5f0d:0500:c100::/64


   application: <service> <hostname> [port[/protocol]]

      This attribute describes the different services available on the
      site.  The services are the same as described in the
      '/etc/services' plus 'ping' More services might be added later on.

      Hostname is the DNS hostname of the host that provides the service
      and a port number and protocol type may be specified for services
      that don't run on the standard port.

      Syntax:

      /^S+[a-zA-Z-]+(.[a-zA-Z-])*+(/udp|/tcp))?$/

      Examples:

      application: ping pinghost.ISI.EDU application: ftp  ftp.ISI.EDU


   tunnel:  <Protocol1> in <Protocol2> <src> -> <dst> <IPv6-site>

Draft                       IPv6 site object                  March 1997


      This attribute defines a tunnel of Protocol1 in Protocol2 from
      address src to address dst. You only need to define your side of
      the tunnel.  The other end should be present in the object of the
      other party's site object. Note that tunnels should in general be
      configured symmetrically along both end-points and only be present
      in the object if they are actually configured and working at both
      ends.

      Currently (only) the following type of tunnels are accepted:

      tunnel:  IPv6 in IPv4 <SrcDomainname> -> <DstDomainName> <IPv6-site>
                                                     <Protocol> [FreeText]

      It is expected that more possibilities will be added later.

      Currently defined protocols are: IDRPv6, BGP5, RIPv6, STATIC
      Syntax checking will not be done on this field to allow for newer
      and fast implementations of other protocols.

      Domainnames are used for greater flexibility. It makes it for
      example trivial to obtain the IPv6 or IPv4 address from DNS if
      needed.

      Example:

      tunnel: IPv6 in IPv4 tbc5000-18.tbit.dk -> unvea.denet.dk
                                                        TELEBIT IDRPv6


   contact: <NIC-handle>

      This is the contact information of the site. Use a valid NIC
      handle that you received when creating an entry for your personal
      data in one of the registry databases (do 'whois -h whois.ripe.net
      HELP' for help on creating such an object).

      Example:

      contact: DK13-RIPE

      Note for DNS databases:

      References for DNS style databases can be defined as follows:

      - use a valid NIC-handle that points to an entry in a whois Internet
        registry database

      - use the following syntax:

        contact: YourName (DomainNameOfTextRecordWithYourContactObject)

      - the ipv6-site object has a personal data entry attached in DNS
        (separated by an empty record with a line number only) and the
        contact entry has the same value as the name of the person.

        person:      [mandatory]  [single]
        address:     [mandatory]  [multiple]

        e-mail:      [optional]   [multiple]
        remarks:     [optional]   [multiple]
        changed:     [mandatory]  [multiple]


   url: <URL>

      Put here any useful URLs that are of interest for your site

      Example:

      url: <http://www.iol.unh.edu>


   remarks: <FreeText>

      Put here any information that might be interesting for the other
      people at the 6bone to know about or use it for site specific
      information.  Also 'not yet accepted new functionality' to the
      objects can be put here (temporarely).

      Many people use this to report about the status of their site; is
      it in implementation phase, is it up and running or are there
      still techincal problems.

      Syntax:

      /^.*$/

      Example:

      remarks: operational since July 5, 1996
      remarks: happy to add new tunnels upon request.
      remarks: 6bone-router.cisco.com carries all ipv6 routes.

      Use this attribute to show who was resposible for a
      change/addition of the object and the date on which it took
      effect. You may use more changed attribute to reflect the change
      history of the object.

      The date field has the following format: YYMMDD (in the RIPE
      database) Other databases that don't have a format defined yet are
      recommended to use an YYYYMMDD format. It is expected that the
      RIPE database will support this format in the future. Note that
      more changes attributes can be specified to show a history of
      changes.

      Example:

      changed: davidk@ISI.EDU 960923


   source: RIPE

      This field is always the same for now. It describes the place
      where the object can be updated and is stored.

      Example:

      source: RIPE

      Note that a 'source:' field is not relevant for non-RIPE
      databases.  Whois query tools are recommended to use a 'source:
      DNS' to identify data that is extracted from DNS or another clear
      identifier for other databases.


Security considerations

   There are no security implications.
