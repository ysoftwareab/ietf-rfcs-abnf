                    RFC Series Responsibility Change
                   draft-rosen-rfcefdp-update-2026-02

Abstract

   In [I-D.iab-rfcefdp-rfced-model], responsibility for the RFC series
   moved to the RFC Series Working Group and the RFC Series Approval
   Board.  It is no longer the responsibility of the RFC Editor and the
   role of the IAB in the RFC Series is altered.  Accordingly, in
   RFC2026 Section 2.1, the sentence "RFC publication is the direct
   responsibility of the RFC Editor, under the general direction of the
   IAB" is deleted.
