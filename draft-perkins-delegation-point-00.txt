Draft                  DELEGATION-POINT Construct           May 27, 1996


2.  Introduction

This memo defines an experimental construct to be used with managing the
assignments of object identifiers (OIDs).  Assignments are made by the
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), by IETF working groups, and
by enterprises.  OIDs are primarily used in defining items in
specifications called Management Information Bases (MIBs) for use with
the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  The format of MIB
specifications is defined in a collection of documents called the SMI.
Version 1 is defined by[1][2] and version 2 is defined by[3][4][5].

This memo specifies a parsable construct that can be used to explicitly
document the delegation of authority for OID assignments.  This
construct can be easily converted to compatible constructs for the
SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 SMIs.

This memo specifies a parsable construct, called DELEGATION-POINT, and
proposes that it be added to a future version of the SNMPv2 SMI.  The
construct is an ASN.1 macro to explicitly document OID delegation.  This
construct is easily translatable to existing constructs in the SNMPv1
and SNMPv2 SMIs.  However, the result from translation is an ASN.1
comments and thus is not in an unambiguous parsable format.

This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.


3.  Background

Management of the OID assignments used in defining items in SNMP MIB
modules is a key task that has high risk and high penalty for mistakes.
This risk is because once a valid assignment has been made, it cannot be
changed and it lasts for eternity.  OIDs are structured in a
hierarchical tree.  The owner of a sub-tree has responsibility for
assignments and delegation of assignments within that sub-tree.
Delegation of assignment is the act of giving ownership of a sub-tree
within a sub-tree to another.

The language for SNMP MIB modules contains parsable constructs for
specifying assignments of OIDs, but does not contain a parsable
construct for specifying delegation of ownership. Without such a
construct, it may not be clear who has the authority for assignments in
a specific sub-tree.  Without such a construct, there is no audit trail
to verify that a claimed assignment was actually made or that it was
done by the owner or person authorized by the owner.  Currently,
delegations are documented through ad hoc communication mechanisms and
procedures.

END


5.  Description of the DELEGATION-POINT Construct

The construct is specified as:

    <descriptor> DELEGATION-POINT <clauses> ::= <oidValue>

where <descriptor> is the ASN.1 identifier of the item being defined,
<clauses> are the clauses of the DELEGATION-POINT construct, and
<oidValue> is the OID value of the root of the delegated sub-tree.

5.1.  Descriptor

The SNMPv2 SMI has restrictions on descriptors, which also apply to the
<descriptor> for items defined with the DELEGATION-POINT construct.

A descriptor must consist of one or more letters or digits, and its
initial character must be a lower-case letter.  (Also, the SNMPv2 SMI
does not allow hyphens, even though hyphen is allowed by SNMPv1 SMI.)

Furthermore, the SNMPv2 SMI requires that for all descriptors appearing
in an information module, the descriptor shall be unique and mnemonic,
and shall not exceed 64 characters in length.  (However, descriptors

Draft                  DELEGATION-POINT Construct           May 27, 1996


longer than 32 characters are not recommended.)  This requirement
promotes a common language for humans to use when discussing the
information module and also facilitates simple table mappings for user-
interfaces.

The set of descriptors defined in all "standard" information modules
must be unique.

5.2.  Clauses

The clauses of the DELEGATION-POINT construct specify the information
needed for managing delegation of OID assignments.

The ASSIGNED-DATE clause, which must be present, contains the date and
time that this delegation was assigned. The date and time are
represented in UTC Time format (see Appendix B of [3]).

(Note that there is no ASSIGNED-BY-ORG clause, since this must be the
same as the organization which is named in the ORGANIZATION clause of
the MODULE-IDENTITY construct of the MIB module containing a DELEGATION-
POINT construct.)

The ASSIGNED-BY-CONTACT clause, which must be present, contains the
name, postal address, telephone number, and electronic mail address of
the person to whom technical queries concerning this assignment should
be sent.

The ASSIGNED-TO-ORG clause, which must be present, contains a textual
name of the organization to receive the OID sub-tree delegation.

The ASSIGNED-TO-CONTACT clause, which must be present, contains the
name, postal address, telephone number, and electronic mail address of
the person (or pseudo person such as a position) to whom technical
queries concerning this delegation should be sent.

The DESCRIPTION clause, which must be present, contains a textual
description of this delegation.

The REFERENCE clause, which need not be present, contains a textual
cross-reference to a document using this delegation.


5.3.  OID Value

The OID value specifies the sub-tree that is delegated.  This value may
be registered by another SNMP construct, such as an OBJECT-TYPE, MODULE-
IDENTITY, or OBJECT-IDENTITY construct.  The organization to receive the
delegation owns the registration of the OID value.  The OBJECT-IDENTITY
construct, in most situations, is the preferred one to register the root
of the delegated sub-tree.

The DELEGATION-POINT construct may be used by IANA, IETF WGs, and
enterprises (and contained entities within an enterprise) to manage
delegation of OID assignments. Below are examples of each type of
delegation:
