</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">Port Control Protocol (PCP) provides a mechanism to control how incoming packets are forwarded by upstream devices such as NAT64, NAT44, and firewall devices, and a mechanism to reduce application keepalive traffic. PCP is primarily designed to be implemented in the context of both Carrier-Grade NATs (CGN) and small NATs (e.g., residential NATs).  PCP allows hosts to operate server for a long time (e.g., a webcam) or a short time (e.g., while playing a game or on a phone call) when behind a NAT device, including when behind a CGN operated by their Internet service provider.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">PCP allows applications to create mappings from an external IP address and port to an internal IP address and port. These mappings are required for successful inbound communications destined to machines located behind a NAT or a firewall.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">After creating a mapping for incoming connections, it is necessary to inform remote computers about the IP address and port for the incoming connection. This is usually done in an application-specific manner. For example, a computer game would use a rendezvous server specific to that game (or specific to that game developer), and a SIP phone would use a SIP proxy. PCP does not provide this rendezvous function. The rendezvous function will support IPv4, IPv6, or both. Depending on that support and the application's support of IPv4 or IPv6, the PCP client will need an IPv4 mapping, an IPv6 mapping, or both.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">Many NAT-friendly applications send frequent application-level messages to ensure their session will not be timed out by a NAT. These are commonly called "NAT keepalive" messages, even though they are not sent to the NAT itself (rather, they are sent 'through' the NAT). These applications can reduce the frequency of those NAT keepalive messages by using PCP to learn (and influence) the NAT mapping lifetime. This helps reduce bandwidth on the subscriber's access network, traffic to the server, and battery consumption on mobile devices.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">Many NATs and firewalls have included application layer gateways (ALGs) to create mappings for applications that establish additional streams or accept incoming connections. ALGs incorporated into NATs additionally modify the application payload. Industry experience has shown that these ALGs are detrimental to protocol evolution. PCP allows an application create its own mappings in NATs and firewalls, reducing the incentive to deploy ALGs in NATs and firewalls.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.1">The PCP machinery assumes a single-homed host model. That is, for a given IP version, only one default route exists to reach the Internet.  This is important because after a PCP mapping is created and an inbound packet (e.g., TCP SYN) arrives at the host, the outbound response (e.g., TCP SYNACK) has to go through the same path so the proper address rewriting takes place on that outbound response packet.  This restriction exists because otherwise there would need to be one PCP server for each egress, because the host could not reliably determine which egress path packets would take, so the client would need to be able to reliably make the same internal/external mapping in every NAT gateway, which in general is not possible.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Internal Host:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>A host served by a NAT gateway, or protected by a firewall. This is the host that receives the incoming traffic created by a PCP MAP request, or the host that initiated an implicit dynamic mapping (e.g., by sending a TCP SYN) across a firewall or a NAT.</dd>
<dt>Remote Host:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>A host with which an Internal Host is communicating.</dd>
<dt>Internal Address:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br> The address of an Internal Host served by a NAT gateway (typically a private address <a href="#RFC1918">[RFC1918]</a>) or protected by a firewall.</dd>
<dt>External Address:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br> The address of an Internal Host as seen by other Remote Hosts on the Internet with which the Internal Host is communicating, after translation by any NAT gateways on the path. An External Address is generally a public routable (i.e., non-private) address. In the case of an Internal Host protected by a pure firewall, with no address translation on the path, its External Address is the same as its Internal Address.</dd>
<dt>Remote Peer Address:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br> The address of a Remote Host, as seen by the Internal Host. A Remote Address is generally a public routable address. In the case of a Remote Host that is itself served by a NAT gateway, the Remote Address may in fact be the Remote Host's External Address, but since this remote translation is generally invisible to software running on the Internal Host, the distinction can safely be ignored for the purposes of this document.</dd>
<dt>Third Party:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>In the common case, an Internal Host manages its own Mappings using PCP requests, and the Internal Address of those Mappings is the same as the source IP address of the PCP request packet. <br><br> In the case where one device is managing Mappings on behalf of some other device, the presence of the THIRD_PARTY option in the MAP request signifies that the specified address, not the source IP address of the PCP request packet, should be used as the Internal Address for the Mapping. This can occur when PCP is proxied (e.g., UPnP IGD to PCP proxy) or if the internal host does not implement PCP.</dd>
<dt>Mapping, Port Mapping, Port Forwarding:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>A NAT mapping creates a relationship between an internal IP address, protocol, and port and an external IP address, protocol, and port.  More specifically, it creates a translation rule where packets destined to the external IP and port are translated to the internal IP and port, and vice versa. In the case of a pure firewall, the "Mapping" is the identity function, translating an internal port number to the same external port number, and this "Mapping" indicates to the firewall that traffic to and from this internal port number is permitted to pass.  The term "Port Forwarding" is sometimes used instead of "Port Mapping" in the case where the internal and external ports are the same, e.g. a mapping which forwards packets addressed to external address:port 192.0.2.1:12345 to internal address:port 192.168.1.1:12345.  </dd>
<dt>Mapping Types:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>There are three different ways to create mappings: implicit dynamic mappings, explicit dynamic mappings, and static mappings. Implicit dynamic mappings are created as a result of a TCP SYN or outgoing UDP packet, and allow Internal Hosts to receive replies to their outbound packets.  Explicit dynamic mappings are created as a result of PCP MAP requests.  Static mappings are created by manual configuration (e.g., command-line interface or web page).  Explicit and static mappings allow Internal Hosts to receive inbound traffic that is not in direct response to any immediately preceeding outbound communication (i.e. allow Internal Hosts to operate a "server", is accessible to other hosts on the Internet).  Both implicit and explicit dynamic mappings are dynamic in the sense that they are created on demand, as requested (implicitly or explicitly) by the Internal Host, and have a lifetime, after which they are automatically deleted unless the lifetime is extended by action by the Internal Host.  Static mappings differ from dynamic mappings in that their lifetime is typically infinite (they exist until manually removed) but otherwise they behave exactly the same as an explicit dynamic mapping with infinite lifetime.  For example, a PCP MAP request to create a mapping that already exists as a static mapping will return a successful result, confirming that the requested mapping exists.</dd>
<dt>PCP Client:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>A PCP software instance responsible for issuing PCP requests to a PCP server. One or several PCP Clients can be embedded in the same host. Several PCP Clients can be located in the same local network.  A PCP Client can issue PCP request on behalf of a third party device for which it is authorized to do so. An interworking function, from UPnP IGD to PCP, or from NAT-PMP <a href="#I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp">[I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp]</a> is another example of a PCP Client. A PCP server in a NAT gateway that is itself a client of another NAT gateway (nested NAT) may itself act as a PCP client to the upstream NAT.</dd>
<dt>PCP Server:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>A network element which receives and processes PCP requests from a PCP client.  Generally this is a PCP-capable NAT gateway or firewall. A NAT gateway creates mappings determining how it translates packets it forwards, and PCP enables clients to communicate with the NAT gateway about those mappings.  In principle it is also possible for the PCP server to be some other device, which in turn communicates with the NAT gateway using some other network protocol, but this introduces additional complexity and fragility into the system, and is a deployment detail which should be implemented in a way that is invisible to the PCP client.  See also <a href="#relationship">Section 4</a>.</dd>
<dt>Interworking Function:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>a functional element responsible for interworking another protocol with PCP. For example interworking between <a href="#IGD">UPnP IGD</a> <cite title="NONE">[IGD]</cite> with PCP or NAT-PMP <a href="#I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp">[I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp]</a> and PCP.</dd>
<dt>subscriber:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>an entity provided access to the network. In the case of a commercial ISP, this is typically a single home.</dd>
<dt>host:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>a device which can have packets sent to it, as a result of PCP operations. A host is not necessarily a PCP client.</dd>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.1">A PCP OpCode can be extended with an Option. Options can be used in requests and responses. The decision about whether to include a given piece of information in the base opcode format or in an option is an engineering trade-off between packet size and code complexity. For information that is usually (or always) required, placing it in the fixed opcode data results in simpler code to generate and parse the packet, because the information is a fixed location in the opcode data, but wastes space in the packet in the event that that field is all-zeroes because the information is not needed or not relevant. For information that is required less often, placing it in an option results in slightly more compliated code to generate and parse packets containing that option, but saves space in the packet when that information is not needed. Placing information in an option also means that an implementation that never uses that information doesn't even need to implement code to generate and parse it. For example, a client that never requests mappings on behalf of some other device doesn't need to implement code to generate the THIRD_PARTY option, and a PCP server that doesn't implement the necessary security measures to create third-party mappings safely doesn't need to implement code to parse the THIRD_PARTY option.</p>

Additional Options included in the response (if any) MUST be included at the end. A certain Option MAY appear more than once in a request or in a response, if permitted by the definition of the Option itself.

<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.1">This section details operation specific to a PCP server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.2">A PCP server processes incoming requests on the PCP port from clients or an operator-configured interface (e.g., from the ISP's network operations center).  The PCP server MUST drop (ignore) requests that arrive from elsewhere (e.g., the Internet).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.3">Upon receiving a message, the PCP server parses and validates it. A valid request contains a valid PCP common header, one valid PCP Opcode, and zero or more Options (which the server might or might not comprehend). If an error is encountered during processing, the server generates an error response which is sent back to the PCP client.  Processing an OpCode and the Options are specific to each OpCode.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.4">If the received message is shorter than 4 octets, has the R bit set, or the first bit is clear, the message is simply dropped. If the version number is not supported, a response is generated containing the UNSUPP_VERSION result code and the protocol version which the server does understand (if the server understands a range of protocol versions then it returns the supported version closest to the version in the request). Version negotiation is detailed in <a href="#version">Section 6.6</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.5">If the OpCode is not supported, a response is generated with the UNSUPP_OPCODE result code. If the length of the request exceeds 1024 octets or is not a multiple of 4 octets, it is invalid. Invalid requests are handled by copying up to 1024 octets of the request into the response, setting the result code to MALFORMED_REQUEST, and zero-padding the response to a multiple of 4 octets if necessary.</p>

<h1 id="rfc.section.6.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.6.3">6.3.</a> General PCP Client: Processing a Response</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.1">The PCP client receives the response and verifies the source IP address and port belong to the PCP server of an outstanding request.  It validates the version number and OpCode matches an outstanding request. Responses shorter than 12 octets, longer than 1024 octets, or not a multiple of 4 octets are invalid and ignored, likely causing the request to be re-transmitted. The response is further matched by comparing fields in the response OpCode-specific data to fields in the request OpCode-specific data. After a successful match with an outstanding request, the PCP client checks the Epoch field to determine if it needs to restore its state to the PCP server (see <a href="#epoch">Section 6.5</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.2">If the result code is 0, the PCP client knows the request was successful.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.3">If the result code is not 0, the request failed. If the result code is UNSUPP_VERSION, processing continues as described in <a href="#version">Section 6.6</a>. If the result code is SERVER_OVERLOADED, clients SHOULD NOT send *any* further requests to that PCP server for the indicated error lifetime. For other error result codes, The PCP client SHOULD NOT resend the same request for the indicated error lifetime.

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.1">Hosts which desire a PCP mapping might be multi-interfaced (i.e., own several logical/physical interfaces). Indeed, a host can be configured with several IPv4 addresses (e.g., WiFi and Ethernet) or dual-stacked. These IP addresses may have distinct reachability scopes (e.g., if IPv6 they might have global reachability scope as for GUA (Global Unicast Address) or limited scope such as ULA (Unique Local Address, <a href="#RFC4193">[RFC4193]</a>)).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.2">IPv6 addresses with global reachability scope SHOULD be used as the source interface when generating a PCP request. IPv6 addresses with limited scope (e.g., <a href="#RFC4193">ULA</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4193]</cite>), SHOULD NOT be used as the source interface when generating a PCP request. If <a href="#RFC4941">IPv6 privacy addresses</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4941]</cite> are used for PCP mappings, a new PCP request will need to be issued whenever the IPv6 privacy address is changed. This PCP request SHOULD be sent from the IPv6 privacy address itself. It is RECOMMENDED that mappings to the previous privacy address be deleted.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.3">A host might gain or lose interfaces while existing mappings are active (e.g., Ethernet cable plugged in or removed, joining/leaving a WiFi network). Because of this, if the PCP client is sending a PCP request to maintain state in the PCP server, it SHOULD ensure those PCP requests continue to use the same interface (e.g., when refreshing mappings). If the PCP client is sending a PCP request to create new state in the PCP server, it MAY use a different source interface or different source address.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.4">Due to the ubiquity of IPv4 NAT, IPv4 addresses with limited scope (e.g., <a href="#RFC1918">private addresses</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC1918]</cite>) MAY be used as the source interface when generating a PCP request.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.5">As mentioned in <a href="#single_homed">Section 2.3</a>, only single-homed CP routers are in scope. Therefore, there is no viable scenario where a host located behind a CP router is assigned with two GUA addresses belonging to different global IPv6 prefixes.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.6.5">6.5.</a> <a href="#epoch" id="epoch">Epoch</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.1">Every PCP response sent by the PCP server includes an Epoch field.  This field increments by 1 every second, and is used by the PCP client to determine if PCP state needs to be restored. If the PCP server resets or loses the state of its explicit dynamic Mappings (that is, those mappings created by PCP MAP requests), due to reboot, power failure, or any other reason, it MUST reset its Epoch time to 0. Similarly, if the public IP address(es) of the NAT (controlled by the PCP server) changes, the Epoch MUST be reset to 0. A PCP server MAY maintain one Epoch value for all PCP clients, or MAY maintain distinct Epoch values for each PCP client; this choice is implementation-dependent.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.2">Whenever a client receives a PCP response, the client computes its own conservative estimate of the expected Epoch value by taking the Epoch value in the last packet it received from the gateway and adding 7/8 (87.5%) of the time elapsed since that packet was received. If the Epoch value in the newly received packet is less than the client's conservative estimate by more than one second, then the client concludes that the PCP server lost state, and the client MUST immediately renew all its active port mapping leases as described in <a href="#reboot">Section 8.9.1</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.3">When the PCP server reduces its Epoch value, the PCP clients will send PCP requests to refresh their mappings. The PCP server needs to be scaled appropriately to accomodate this traffic. Because PCP lacks a mechanism to simultaneously inform all PCP clients of the Epoch value, the PCP clients will not flood the PCP server simultaneously when the PCP server reduces its Epoch value.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.4">In the time between a PCP server loses state and the PCP client notices the lower-than-expected Epoch value, it is possible that the PCP client's mapping will be acquired by another host (via an explicit dynamic mapping or implicit dynamic mapping).  This means incoming traffic will be sent to a different host.  A mechanism to immediately inform the PCP client of state loss would reduce this interval, but would not eliminate this threat.  The PCP client can reduce this interval by using a relatively short lifetime; however, this increases the amount of PCP chatter.  The use of connection authentication between peers (e.g., TLS), or persistent storage of mappings in the PCP server (so it doesn't lose state) eliminates this threat.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.6.6">6.6.</a> <a href="#version" id="version">Version negotiation</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.1">A PCP client sends its requests using PCP version number 1. Should later updates to this document specify different message formats with a version number greater than 1 it is expected that PCP servers will still support version 1 in addition to the newer version(s).  However, in the event that a server returns a response with error code UNSUPP_VERSION, the client MAY log an error message to inform the user that it is too old to work with this server, and the client SHOULD set a timer to retry its request in 30 minutes (in case this was a temporary condition and the server configuration is changed to rectify the situation).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.2">If future PCP versions greater than 1 are specified, version negotiation is expected to proceed as follows: </p>

<ol>
<li>If a client or server supports more than one version it SHOULD support a contiguous range of versions -- i.e., a lowest version and a highest version and all versions in between.</li>
<li>Client sends first request using highest (i.e., presumably 'best') version number it supports.</li>
<li>If server supports that version it responds normally.</li>
<li>If server does not support that version it replies giving a result containing the error code UNSUPP_VERSION, and the closest version number it does support (if the server supports a range of versions higher than the client's requested version, the server returns the lowest of that supported range; if the server supports a range of versions lower than the client's requested version, the server returns the highest of that supported range).</li>
<li>If the client receives an UNSUPP_VERSION result containing a version it does support, it records this fact and proceeds to use this message version for subsequent communication with this PCP server (until a possible future UNSUPP_VERSION response if the server is later updated, at which point the version negotiation process repeats).</li>
<li>If the client receives an UNSUPP_VERSION result containing a version it does not support then the client MAY log an error message to inform the user that it is too old to work with this server, and the client SHOULD set a timer to retry its request in 30 minutes.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.2">As normal, the application needs to begin listening to a port, and to ensure that it can get exclusive use of that port it needs to choose a port that is not in the operating system's ephemeral port range.  Then, the application constructs a PCP message with the appropriate MAP OpCode depending on if it is listening on an IPv4 or IPv6 interface and if it wants a public IPv4 or IPv6 address.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.1">A host operating a client (e.g., XMPP client, SIP client) sends from a port but never accepts incoming connections on this port. It wants to ensure the flow to its server is not terminated (due to inactivity) by an on-path NAT or firewall. To accomplish this, the applications uses the procedure described in this section.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.2">Middleboxes such as NATs or firewalls need to see occasional traffic or will terminate their session state, causing application failures. To avoid this, many applications routinely generate keepalive traffic for the primary (or sole) purpose of maintaining state with such middleboxes. Applications can reduce such application keepalive traffic by using PCP. </p>

<ul class="empty"><li>Note: For reasons beyond NAT, an application may find it useful to perform application-level keepalives, such as to detect a broken path between the client and server, detect a crashed server, or detect a powered-down client. These keepalives are not related to maintaining middlebox state, and PCP cannot do anything useful to reduce those keepalives.</li></ul>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.3">To use PCP for this function, the applications first connects to its server, as normal. Afterwards, it issues a PCP request with the PEER4 or PEER6 OpCode as described in <a href="#peer_opcodes">Section 9</a>. The PEER4 OpCode is used if the host is using IPv4 for its communication to its peer; PEER6 if using IPv6. The same 5-tuple as used for the connection to the server is placed into the PEER4 or PEER6 payload.</p>

To accomplish this, the application uses the procedure described in this section.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.2">An application that is using the same port for outgoing connections as well as incoming connections MUST first signal its operation of a server using the PCP MAP OpCode, as described in <a href="#map_opcodes">Section 8</a>, and receive a positive PCP response before it sends any packets from that port. </p>

<ul class="empty"><li>Discussion: Although reversing those steps is tempting (to eliminate the PCP round trip before a packet can be sent from that port) and will work if the NAT has endpoint-independent mappings (EIM) behavior, reversing the steps will fail if the NAT does not have EIM behavior. With a non-EIM NAT, the implicit mapping created by an outgoing TCP SYN and the explicit mapping created using the MAP OpCode will cause different ports to be assigned (which is not desirable; after all, the application is using the same port for outgoing and incoming traffic on purpose) and they will generally also have different lifetimes. PCP does not attempt to change or dictate how a NAT creates its mappings (endpoint independent mapping, or otherwise) so there is no assurance that an implicit mapping will be EIM or non-EIM. Thus, it is necessary for applications to first signal its operation of a server using the PCP MAP OpCode.</li></ul>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.6.p.1">The PCP client requests a certain lifetime, and the PCP server responds with the assigned lifetime. The PCP server MAY grant a lifetime smaller or larger than the requested lifetime. The PCP server SHOULD be configurable for permitted minimum and maximum lifetime, and the RECOMMENDED values are 120 seconds for the minimum value and 24 hours for the maximum. It is RECOMMENDED that the server restrict lifetimes to less than 24 hours, because they will consume ports even if the internal host is no longer interested in receiving the traffic or no longer connected to the network.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.6.p.2">Once a PCP server has responded positively to a mapping request for a certain lifetime, the port forwarding is active for the duration of the lifetime unless the lifetime is reduced by the PCP client (to a shorter lifetime or to zero) or until the PCP server loses its state (e.g., crashes). This means that even if there is active traffic, the mapping will be deleted when its lifetime expires.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.6.p.3">If the requested lifetime is 0 then: </p>

<ul>
<li>If the internal port and protocol both are non-zero, it indicates a request to delete the indicated mapping immediately.</li>
<li>If the internal port is non-zero and the protocol is zero, it indicates a request to delete all mappings for this Internal Address for the given internal port for all transport protocols.</li>
<li>If the internal port and protocol both are zero, it indicates a request to delete all mappings for this Internal Address for all transport protocols. This is useful when a host reboots or joins a new network, to clear out prior stale state from the NAT gateway before beginning to install new mappings.</li>
</ul>

<p> The suggested external address and port fields are ignored in requests where the requested lifetime is 0.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.6.p.4">PCP MAP requests cannot delete mappings created by non-MAP requests. If the PCP client attempts to delete a static mapping (i.e., a mapping created outside of PCP itself) or attempts to delete an implicit dynamic mapping (e.g., created by a TCP SYN), the PCP server deletes all of the mappings it can and responds with a zero error code.  If the PCP client attempts to delete a mapping that does not exist, the SUCCESS result code is returned (this is necessary for PCP to be idempotent). If the deletion request was properly formatted, a SUCCESS response is generated with lifetime of 0 and the server copies the protocol and internal port number from the request into the response.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.6.p.5">An application that forgets its PCP-assigned mappings (e.g., the application or OS crashes) will request new PCP mappings. This may consume port mappings, if the application binds to a different Internal Port every time it runs. The application will also likely initiate new implicit dynamic mappings (e.g., TCP connections) without using PCP, which will also consume port mappings. If there is a port mapping quota for the internal host, frequent restarts such as this may exhaust the quota. PCP provides some protections against such port consumption: When a PCP client first acquires a new IP address (e.g., reboots or joins a new network), it SHOULD remove mappings that may already be instantiated for that Internal Address. To do this, the PCP client sends a MAP request with protocol, internal port, and lifetime set to 0.  Some port mapping APIs (such as the "DNSServiceNATPortMappingCreate" API provided by Apple's Bonjour on Mac OS X, iOS, Windows, Linux, etc.) automatically monitor for process exit (including application crashes) and automatically send port mapping deletion requests if the process that requested them goes away without explicitly relinquishing them.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.6.p.6">In order to reduce unwanted traffic and data corruption, a port that was mapped using the MAP OpCode SHOULD NOT be assigned to another internal target, or another subscriber, for 120 seconds (MSL, <a href="#RFC0793">[RFC0793]</a>). However, the PCP server MUST allow the same internal address to re-acquire the same port during that same interval.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.8.7">8.7.</a> Subscriber Renumbering</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.7.p.1">The customer premises router might obtain a new IPv4 address or new IPv6 prefix. This can occur because of a variety of reasons including a reboot, power outage, DHCP lease expiry, or other action by the ISP.  If this occurs, traffic forwarded to the subscriber might be delivered to another customer who now has that address. This affects both implicit dynamic mappings and explicit dynamic mappings. However, this same problem occurs today when a subscriber's IP address is re-assigned, without PCP and without an ISP-operated CGN. The solution is the same as today: the problems associated with subscriber renumbering are caused by subscriber renumbering and are eliminated if subscriber renumbering is avoided. PCP defined in this document does not provide machinery to reduce the subscriber renumbering problem.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.7.p.2">When a new Internal Address is assigned to a host embedding a PCP client, the NAT (or firewall) controlled by the PCP server will continue to send traffic to the old IP address. Assuming the PCP client wants to continue receiving traffic, it needs to install new mappings for its new IP address. The suggested external port field will not be fulfilled by the PCP server, in all likelihood, because it is still being forwarded to the old IP address. Thus, a mapping is likely to be assigned a new external port number and/or public IP address. Note that this scenario is not expected to happen routinely on a regular basis for most hosts, since most hosts renew their DHCP leases before they expire (or re-request the same address after reboot) and most DHCP servers honor such requests and grant the host the same address it was previously using before the reboot.</p>

As with other PCP errors, returning an error causes no state to be changed in the PCP server or in the PCP-controlled device. If an existing mapping exists (with or without a filter) and the server receives a MAP request with FILTER, the filters indicated in the new request are added to any existing filters. If a MAP request has a lifetime of 0 and contains the FILTER option, the error MALFORMED_OPTION is returned.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.8.9.p.1">If an event occurs that causes the PCP server to lose state (such as a crash or power outage), the mappings created by PCP are lost.  Such loss of state is rare in a service provider environment (due to redundant power, disk drives for storage, etc.). But such loss of state is more common in a residential NAT device which does not write information to its non-volatile memory.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.9.p.2">The Epoch allows a client to deduce when a PCP server may have lost its state. If this occurs, the PCP client can attempt to recreate the mappings following the procedures described in this section.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8.9.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.8.9.1">8.9.1.</a> <a href="#reboot" id="reboot">Recreating Mappings</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.9.1.p.1">The PCP server SHOULD store mappings in persistent storage so when it is powered off or rebooted, it remembers the port mapping state of the network. Due to the physical architecture of some PCP servers, this is not always achievable (e.g., some non-volatile memory can withstand only a certain number of writes, so writing PCP mappings to such memory is generally avoided).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.9.1.p.2">However, maintaining this state is not essential for correct operation. When the PCP server loses state and begins processing new PCP messages, its Epoch is reset to zero (per the procedure of <a href="#epoch">Section 6.5</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.9.1.p.3">A mapping renewal packet is formatted identically to an original mapping request; from the point of view of the client it is a renewal of an existing mapping, but from the point of view of the PCP server it appears as a new mapping request. In the normal process of routinely renewing its mappings before they expire, a PCP client will automatically recreate all its lost mappings.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.9.1.p.4">In addtion, as the result of receiving a packet where the Epoch field indicates that a reboot or similar loss of state has occurred, the client can renew its port mappings sooner, without waiting for the normal routine renewal time.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.9.1.p.5">The discussion in this section focuses on recreating inbound port mappings after loss of PCP server state, because that is the more serious problem. Losing port mappings for outgoing connections destroys those currently active connections, but does not prevent clients from establishing new outgoing connections. In contrast, losing inbound port mappings not only destroys all existing inbound connections, but also prevents the reception of any new inbound connections until the port mapping is recreated. Accordingly, we consider recovery of inbound port mappings the more important priority. However, clients that want outgoing connections to survive a NAT gateway reboot can also achieve that using PCP. After initiating an outbound TCP connection (which will cause the NAT gateway to establish an implicit port mapping) the client should send the NAT gateway a PEER request for the source port of its TCP connection, which will cause the NAT gateway to send a response giving the external port it allocated for that mapping. The client can then store this information, and use it later to recreate the mapping if it determines that the NAT gateway has lost its mapping state.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8.9.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.8.9.2">8.9.2.</a> Maintaining Mappings</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.9.2.p.1">A PCP client can refresh a mapping by sending a new PCP request containing information from the earlier PCP response. The PCP server will respond indicating the new lifetime. It is possible, due to failure of the PCP server, that the public IP address and/or public port, or the PCP server itself, has changed (due to a new route to a different PCP server). To detect such events more quickly, the PCP client may find it beneficial to use shorter lifetimes (so that it communicates with the PCP server more often). If the PCP client has several mappings, the Epoch value only needs to be retrieved for one of them to verify the PCP server has not lost port forwarding state.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.9.2.p.2">If the client wishes to check the PCP server's Epoch, it sends a PCP request for any one of the client's mappings. This will return the current Epoch value. In that request the PCP client could extend the mapping lifetime (by asking for more time) or maintain the current lifetime (by asking for the same number of seconds that it knows are remaining of the lifetime).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.9.2.p.3">If a internal IP address is no longer valid (e.g., because the internal host has moved to a new network), and the PCP client wishes to still receive incoming traffic, it MUST create a new mapping on that new network. A new mapping will also require an update to the application-specific rendezvous server (<a href="#operating_a_server">Section 7.1</a>).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.2">The PEER4 or PEER6 OpCodes MUST NOT be sent until establishing bi-directional communication with the remote peer. For TCP, this means completing the TCP 3-way handshake. This is because the PCP-controlled device may not be able to extend the lifetime of a mapping until after bi-directional communications has been established. The Internal Address for the PEER request is the the PEER request's source IP address.  [Why not? Why not allow the PEER request to make a mapping, just like a TCP SYN does?] </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.3">The PEER4 and PEER6 OpCodes contain a description of the remote peer address, from the perspective of the PCP client. This is important when the PCP-controlled device is performing address family translation (NAT46 or NAT64), because the destination address from the perspective of the PCP client is different from the destination address on the other side of the address family translation device.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.1">This section describes the operation of a server when receiving a request with the OpCodes PEER4 or PEER6.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.2">On receiving the PEER4 or PEER6 OpCode, the PCP server examines the mapping table. If a mapping does not exist, the NONEXIST_PEER error is returned.  [Why not? Why not allow the PEER request to make a mapping, just like a TCP SYN does?] </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.3">The PEER4 or PEER6 OpCodes MUST NOT reduce the lifetime of an existing mapping. If the mapping is terminated by the TCP client or server (e.g., TCP FIN or TCP RST), the mapping will eventually be destroyed normally; the earlier use of PEER does not extend the lifetime in that case.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.4">If the PCP-controlled device can extend the lifetime of a mapping, the PCP server uses the smaller of its configured maximum lifetime value and the requested lifetime from the PEER request, and sets the lifetime to that value.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.5">If all of the proceeding operations were successful (did not generate an error response), then a SUCCESS response is generated, with the assigned-lifetime containing the lifetime of the mapping.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.6">After a successful PEER response is sent, it is implementation-specific if the PCP-controlled device destroys the mapping when the lifetime expires, or if inside-&gt;outside traffic keeps the mapping alive.

<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.1">This section describes the operation of a client when processing a response with the OpCodes PEER4 or PEER6.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.2">A response is matched with a request by comparing the protocol, external AF, internal IP address, internal port, remote peer address and remote peer port. Other fields are not compared, because the PCP server changes those fields to provide information about the mapping created by the OpCode.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.3">If the error response NONEXIST_PEER is received, this could have occurred if the PCP client sent its PEER request before the PCP-controlled device had installed the mapping, or because the mapping has been destroyed (e.g., due to a TCP FIN). If the PCP client believes the mapping should exist, the PCP client SHOULD retry the request after a brief delay (e.g., 5 seconds).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.4">Other error responses SHOULD NOT be retried.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.5">If a successful response, the PCP client uses the assigned lifetime value to reduce its frequency of application keepalives for that particular NAT mapping. Of course, there may be other reasons, specific to the application, to use more frequent application keepalives. For example, the PCP assigned-lifetime could be one hour but the application may want to ensure the server is still accessible (e.g., has not crashed) more frequently than once an hour.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.6">If the PCP client wishes to keep this mapping alive beyond the indicated lifetime, it SHOULD issue a new PCP request prior to the expiration. That is, inside-&gt;outside traffic is not sufficient to ensure the mapping will continue to exist. It is RECOMMENDED to send a single renewal request packet when a mapping is halfway to expiration time, then, if no SUCCESS response is received, another single renewal request 3/4 of the way to expiration time, and then another at 7/8 of the way to expiration time, and so on, subject to the constraint that renewal requests MUST NOT be sent less than four seconds apart (a PCP client MUST NOT send an infinite number of ever-closer-together requests in the last few seconds before a mapping expires).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.10.p.2">A THIRD_PARTY Option MUST NOT contain the same address as the source address of the packet. A PCP server receiving a THIRD_PARTY Option specifying the same address as the source address of the packet MUST return a MALFORMED_REQUEST result code. This is because many PCP servers may not implement the THIRD_PARTY Option at all, and a client using the THIRD_PARTY Option to specify the same address as the source address of the packet will cause mapping requests to fail where they would otherwise have succeeded.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.3">A PCP server will only process this option if sent by an authorized PCP client, otherwise will return an error. Determining which PCP clients are authorized to use the THIRD_PARTY option depends on the deployment scenario. For Dual-Stack Lite deployments, the PCP server only supports this option if the source IPv6 address is the B4's source IP address. For other scenarios, the subscriber has only one IPv4 address and this Option serves no purpose (and will only generate error messages from the server). If a subscriber has more than one IPv4 address (from the same ISP, often called "business-class"), the ISP MUST determine its own policy for how to identify the trusted device within the subscriber's home. This might be, for example, the lowest- or highest-numbered host address for that user's IPv4 prefix.  On the other hand, some credible cryptographic security could be used to determine whether a PCP client is authorized to make or delete mappings on behalf of a given Internal Address.</p>

With this configuration, if a user wants to create an explicit dynamic mapping or query an implicit dynamic mapping for another host within their network, the user needs to interact out-of-band with their customer premise router (e.g., using its HTTP administrative interface).  To accomplish this, the PCP server processes requests with the THIRD_PARTY option if they arrived from the IP address of the customer premise router.  In deployments with only one IP address (e.g., which is common in residential networks), the PCP messages will -- by necessity -- arrive from the IP address of the customer premise router router.  In networks where users have multiple IPv4 or multiple IPv6 addresses, the PCP server MUST only allow the THIRD_PARTY option if the PCP message was sent by the IP address of the subscriber's customer premise router.  In Dual-Stack Lite, this would be the B4 element's IPv6 address.  If the packet arrived from a different address, the PCP server MUST generate an UNAUTH_TARGET_ADDRESS error.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.11.p.1">Port Control Protocol (PCP) is a successor to NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP), and shares similar semantics, concepts, and packet formats.  Because of this NAT-PMP and PCP can both use the same port, and use the protocol's built-in version negotiation capabilities to determine which version to use.  It is hoped that in relatively short time most shipping NAT-PMP clients and gateways will be updated to support PCP as well, but there will be a transition period. During this transition period developers updating NAT-PMP clients to add PCP will still want to work with existing NAT-PMP gateways, and developers updating NAT-PMP gateways will still want to support existing NAT-PMP clients. This section describes how an orderly transition may be achieved.</p>

UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function is described in <a href="#I-D.bpw-pcp-upnp-igd-interworking">[I-D.bpw-pcp-upnp-igd-interworking]</a>.</li>
<li>Hosts behind the B4 element will either include a PCP client or UPnP IGD client, or both.<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>if a UPnP IGD client, the B4 element will need to include an interworking function from UPnP IGD to PCP.</li>
<li>if a PCP client, the PCP client will communicate directly with the PCP server.</li>

</li>
<li>The B4 element includes a PCP client which is invoked by an HTTP-based configuration (as is common today). The internal IP address field in the PCP payload would be the internal host used in the port forwarding configuration.</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.13.1.1.p.2">In Dual Stack-Lite, the B4 element encapsulates its PCP messages into the IPv6 tunnel towards the AFTR element. It is expected the B4 element will also perform as a proxy from PCP to PCP <a href="#I-D.bpw-pcp-proxy">[I-D.bpw-pcp-proxy]</a>, and may also proxy from other protocols to PCP (e.g., <a href="#I-D.bpw-pcp-upnp-igd-interworking">[I-D.bpw-pcp-upnp-igd-interworking]</a>.

To accommodate multiple hosts within a home, especially when provided insufficient IPv4 addresses for the number of devices in the home, subscribers operate a NAPT device.

In many situations, especially residential networks that lack an IT staff, the security provided by an IPv6 simple firewall and the security provided by PCP are compatible.

<p id="rfc.section.14.p.3">On today's Internet, ISPs do not typically filter incoming traffic for their subscribers. However, when an ISP introduces stateful address sharing with a NAPT device, such filtering will occur as a side effect.  Filtering will also occur with IPv6 CPE <a href="#RFC6092">[RFC6092]</a>. The MAP OpCode allows a PCP client to create a mapping so that a host can receive inbound traffic and operate a server.

<a href="#rfc.section.14.1">14.1.</a> Denial of Service</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.14.1.p.1">Because the state created in a NAPT or firewall, a per-subscriber quota will likely exist for both implicit dynamic mappings (e.g., outgoing TCP connections) and explicit dynamic mappings (PCP). A subscriber might make an excessive number of implicit or explicit dynamic mappings, consuming an inordinate number of ports, causing a denial of service to other subscribers. Thus, <a href="#quota">Section 12.3</a> recommends that subscribers be limited to a reasonable number of explicit dynamic mappings.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.p.1">[Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section prior to publication.]</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix A.1">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A.1">Appendix A.1.</a> Changes from draft-ietf-pcp-base-06 to -07</h1>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>tightened up THIRD_PARTY security discussion.  Removed "highest numbered address", and left it as simply "the CPE's IP address".</li>
<li>removed UNABLE_TO_DELETE_ALL error.</li>
<li>renumbered Opcodes</li>
<li>renumbered some error codes</li>
<li>assigned value to IMPLICIT_MAPPING_EXISTS.</li>
<li>UNPROCESSED can include arbitrary number of option codes.</li>
<li>Moved lifetime fields into common request/response headers</li>
<li>We've noticed we're having to repeatedly explain to people that the "requested port" is merely a hint, and the NAT gateway is free to ignore it.  Changed name to "suggested port" to better convey this intention.</li>
<li>Added NAT-PMP transition section</li>
<li>Separated Internal Address, External Address, Remote Peer Address definition</li>
<li>Unified Mapping, Port Mapping, Port Forwarding definition</li>
<li>adjusted so DHCP configuration is non-normative.</li>
<li>mentioned PCP refreshes need to be sent over the same interface.</li>
<li>renamed the REMOTE_PEER_FILTER option to FILTER.</li>
<li>Clarified FILTER option to allow sending an ICMP error if policy allows.</li>
<li>for MAP, clarified that if the PCP client changed its IP address and still wants to receive traffic, it needs to send a new MAP request.</li>
<li>clarified that PEER requests have to be sent from same interface as the connection itself.</li>
<li>for MAP opcode, text now requires mapping be deleted when lifetime expires (per consensus on 8-Mar interim meeting)</li>
<li>PEER OpCode: better description of remote peer's IP address, specifically that it does not control or establish any filtering, and explaining why it is 'from the PCP client's perspective'.</li>
<li>Removed latent text allowing DMZ for 'all protocols' (protocol=0). Which wouldn't have been legal, anyway, as protocol 0 is assigned by IANA to HOPOPT (thanks to James Yu for catching that one).</li>
<li>clarified that PCP server only listens on its internal interface.</li>
<li>abandoned 'target' term and reverted to simplier 'internal' term.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix A.2">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A.2">Appendix A.2.</a> Changes from draft-ietf-pcp-base-05 to -06</h1>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>DS-Lite: consensus was encapsulation mode. Included a suggestion that the B4 will need to proxy PCP-to-PCP and UPnP-to-PCP.</li>
<li>defined THIRD_PARTY option to work with the PEER OpCode, too.  This meant moving it to its own section, and having both MAP and PEER OpCodes reference that common section.</li>
<li>used "target" instead of "internal", in the hopes that clarifies internal address used by PCP itself (for sending its packets) versus the address for MAPpings.</li>
<li>Options are now required to be ordered in requests, and ordering has to be validated by the server. Intent is to ease server processing of mandatory-to-implement options.</li>
<li>Swapped Option values for the mandatory- and optional-to-process Options, so we can have a simple lowest..highest ordering.</li>
<li>added MISORDERED_OPTIONS error.</li>
<li>re-ordered some error messages to cause MALFORMED_REQUEST (which is PCP's most general error response) to be error 1, instead of buried in the middle of the error numbers.</li>
<li>clarified that, after successfully using a PCP server, that PCP server is declared to be non-responsive after 5 failed retransmissions.</li>
<li>tightened up text (which was inaccurate) about how long general PCP processing is to delay when receiving an error and if it should honor OpCode-specific error lifetime. Useful for MAP errors which have an error lifetime. (This all feels awkward to have only some errors with a lifetime.)</li>
<li>Added better discussion of multiple interfaces, including highlighting WiFi+Ethernet. Added discussion of using IPv6 Privacy Addresses and RFC1918 as source addresses for PCP requests. This should finish the section on multi-interface issues.</li>
<li>added some text about why server might send SERVER_OVERLOADED, or might simply discard packets.</li>
<li>Dis-allow internal-port=0, which means we dis-allow using PCP as a DMZ-like function. Instead, ports have to be mapped individually.</li>
<li>Text describing server's processing of PEER is tightened up.</li>
<li>Server's processing of PEER now says it is implementation-specific if a PCP server continues to allow the mapping to exist after a PEER message. Client's processing of PEER says that if client wants mapping to continue to exist, client has to continue to send recurring PEER messages.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix A.3">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A.3">Appendix A.3.</a> Changes from draft-ietf-pcp-base-04 to -05</h1>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>tweaked PCP common header packet layout.</li>
<li>Re-added port=0 (all ports).</li>
<li>minimum size is 12 octets (missed that change in -04).</li>
<li>removed Lifetime from PCP common header.</li>
<li>for MAP error responses, the lifetime indicates how long the server wants the client to avoid retrying the request.</li>
<li>More clearly indicated which fields are filled by the server on success responses and error responses.</li>
<li>Removed UPnP interworking section from this document. It will appear in <a href="#I-D.bpw-pcp-upnp-igd-interworking">[I-D.bpw-pcp-upnp-igd-interworking]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix A.4">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A.4">Appendix A.4.</a> Changes from draft-ietf-pcp-base-03 to -04</h1>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>"Pinhole" and "PIN" changed to "mapping" and "MAP".</li>
<li>Reduced from four MAP OpCodes to two. This was done by implicitly using the address family of the PCP message itself.</li>
<li>New option THIRD_PARTY, to more carefully split out the case where a mapping is created to a different host within the home.</li>
<li>Integrated a lot of editorial changes from Stuart and Francis.</li>
<li>Removed nested NAT text into another document, including the IANA-registered IP addresses for the PCP server.</li>
<li>Removed suggestion (MAY) that PCP server reserve UDP when it maps TCP. Nobody seems to need that.</li>
<li>Clearly added NAT and NAPT, such as in residential NATs, as within scope for PCP.</li>
<li>HONOR_EXTERNAL_PORT renamed to PREFER_FAILURE</li>
<li>Added 'Lifetime' field to the common PCP header, which replaces the functions of the 'temporary' and 'permanent' error types of the previous version.</li>
<li>Allow arbitrary Options to be included in PCP response, so that PCP server can indicate un-supported PCP Options. Satisfies PCP Issue #19</li>
<li>Reduced scope to only deal with mapping protocols that have port numbers.</li>
<li>Reduced scope to not support DMZ-style forwarding.</li>
<li>Clarified version negotiation.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix A.5">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A.5">Appendix A.5.</a> Changes from draft-ietf-pcp-base-02 to -03</h1>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Adjusted abstract and introduction to make it clear PCP is intended to forward ports and intended to reduce application keepalives.</li>
<li>First bit in PCP common header is set. This allows DTLS and non-DTLS to be multiplexed on same port, should a future update to this specification add DTLS support.</li>
<li>Moved subscriber identity from common PCP section to MAP* section.</li>
<li>made clearer that PCP client can reduce mapping lifetime if it wishes.</li>
<li>Added discussion of host running a server, client, or symmetric client+server.</li>
<li>Introduced PEER4 and PEER6 OpCodes.</li>
<li>Removed REMOTE_PEER Option, as its function has been replaced by the new PEER OpCodes.</li>
<li>IANA assigned port 44323 to PCP.</li>
<li>Removed AMBIGUOUS error code, which is no longer needed.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix A.6">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A.6">Appendix A.6.</a> Changes from draft-ietf-pcp-base-01 to -02</h1>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>more error codes</li>
<li>PCP client source port number should be random</li>
<li>PCP message minimum 8 octets, maximum 1024 octets.</li>
<li>tweaked a lot of text in section 7.4, "Opcode-Specific Server Operation".</li>
<li>opening a mapping also allows ICMP messages associated with that mapping.</li>
<li>PREFER_FAILURE value changed to the mandatory-to-process range.</li>
<li>added text recommending applications that are crashing obtain short lifetimes, to avoid consuming subscriber's port quota.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix A.7">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A.7">Appendix A.7.</a> Changes from draft-ietf-pcp-base-00 to -01</h1>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Significant document reorganization, primarily to split base PCP operation from OpCode operation.</li>
<li>packet format changed to move 'protocol' outside of PCP common header and into the MAP* opcodes</li>
<li>Renamed Informational Elements (IE) to Options.</li>
<li>Added REMOTE_PEER (for disambiguation with dynamic ports), REMOTE_PEER_FILTER (for simple packet filtering), and PREFER_FAILURE (to optimize UPnP IGD interworking) options.</li>
<li>Is NAT or router behind B4 in scope?</li>
<li>PCP option MAY be included in a request, in which case it MUST appear in a response. It MUST NOT appear in a response if it was not in the request.</li>
<li>Result code most significant bit now indicates permanent/temporary error</li>
<li>PCP Options are split into mandatory-to-process ("P" bit), and into Specification Required and Private Use.</li>
<li>Epoch discussion simplified.</li>
