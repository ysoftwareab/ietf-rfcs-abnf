        Right to Life Issues in Internet Content and Protocols 
                    draft-elris-hrpc-righttolife-00


Abstract

   This document proposes a new IANA registry of Guidance for Blocked
   Content.  Blocked Content is content which has no significant valid
   use and conflicts with the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights" . 
   The format of the proposed registry is provided, and some initial
   categories; for example, human trafficking and 3d printed guns.

INTERNET DRAFT                RightToLife                 August 5, 2018


1  Introduction

   [RFC3552] provides guidance to protocol designers about both how to
   consider security as part of protocol design and how to inform
   readers of protocol specifications about security issues.  [RFC6973]
   provides guidelines for considering privacy in protocol design.
   [RFC3935] in Section 4 states "The Internet isn't value-neutral, and
   neither is the IETF."

   This document provides guidance to content providers on what content
   to block based on the right to life and safety.   This registry
   should contain very few elements.   The right to freedom of speech
   and expression is one of the most sacrosanct rights of mankind. Only
   the most egregious violations, which threaten the life and safety of
   individuals should be on this registry.

   The right to life is one of the basic functions of government.  One
   of the best known sentences in the English language is from the
   [INDEC] Declaration of Independence of the United States of America,
   it is as follows: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
   men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with
   certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and
   the pursuit of Happiness."   This right is also stated in the
   Universal Declaration of Human Rights [UDHR] in Article 3 as
   "Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.  The
   Universal Declaration of Human Rights [UDHR] is one of the documents
   cited in the charter of this Working Group as a foundational
   document.

   Today, quite a few governments are able to effectively control their
   borders such that guns are not readily available to their populace.  
   Many studies show that the availability of guns is correlated with
   violence and death: all of which take away the right to life of
   individuals.

   In the past 20 years, technology has been moving at a rate that
   policy cannot keep up.  Nor do all policy makers understand the
   implications of technology or the technology and protocols
   themselves.

   The impetus to the creation of this document, however, is far
   simpler.  With the advent of specific and detailed plans for guns
   readily available on the Internet to be printed using a 3D printer, a
   line has been crossed.   We must create some common sense limits on
   the rights to post any content whatsoever on the Internet.   

   This document is organized as follows.  Section 2 describes an IANA
   registry to serve as a guidance for content providers to block

   content.  Section 3 describes some proposed initial values for
   blocked content.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2  Blocked Content Guidance Registry

2.1 Identifier

   A numeric identifier for the Blocked Content Type.  This identifier
   MUST be unique within the Blocked Content Guidance Registry.

   The identifier is a 16-bit integer (range 0 to 65535).

   The Identifier 0 should be Reserved.  

   When adding newly registered Blocked Content to the Blocked Content
   Registry, IANA should assign the lowest available identifier to the
   next content type.

2.2 Content Type Name

   As the name of the Content Type is the first thing a potential human
   will use when determining whether it is to be blocked or already
   blocked, it is important to be as precise and descriptive as
   possible.  In future, users will review the names to determine if the
   content they want to block has already been registered, or if a
   similar entry is available as a basis for creating a new entry.

2.3 Description

   This is a full description of the type of content to be blocked.  It
   is a maximum of 1024 characters.


3  Initial Values for Blocked Content

   Identifier: 01
   Content Type Name: 3d_Printed_guns
   Description: Detailed and specific instructions on how to
                print a working gun or parts via a 3d printer

INTERNET DRAFT                RightToLife                 August 5, 2018


   Identifier: 02
   Content Type Name: Slavery
   Description: Descriptions of human beings with or without
                prices offered for sale with contact information
                on how to perform such a transaction


4 Security Considerations

   In terms of protocols, no new security vulnerabilities are introduced
   as a result of this document.

5  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the following IANA Actions.

5.1  New Namespace Assignments

   This document requests the allocation of the URI prefix
   urn:ietf:blocked for the purpose of generating URIs for blocked
   content in general.  

5.2  New Blocked Content Guidance Registry

   This document specifies the procedure for the Blocked Content
   Registry setup.  IANA is requested to create a new registry for
   Blocked Content called "Guidance to Blocked Content".  This Registry
   will contain the following Summary columns:

   Identifier:

   Content Type Name:

   Description:

   Descriptions of these columns and additional information found in the
   template for registry entries (categories and columns) are further
   defined in section 2.
