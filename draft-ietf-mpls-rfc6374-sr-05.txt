Performance Measurement Using RFC 6374 for Segment Routing Networks with
                            MPLS Data Plane
                     draft-ietf-mpls-rfc6374-sr-05

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  RFC 6374
   specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and accurate
   measurement of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as well as
   related metrics such as delay variation in MPLS networks.  This
   document utilizes these mechanisms for Performance Delay and Loss
   Measurements in SR networks with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS), for both
   SR-MPLS links and end-to-end SR-MPLS paths including Policies.  In
   addition, this document defines Return Path TLV and Block Number TLV
   extensions for RFC 6374.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm for
   Software Defined Networks (SDNs).  SR is applicable to both
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes.
   SR takes advantage of the Equal-Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) between
   source and transit nodes, between transit nodes and between transit
   and destination nodes.  SR Policies as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] are used to steer traffic
   through a specific, user-defined paths using a stack of Segments.  A
   comprehensive SR Performance Measurement (PM) toolset is one of the
   essential requirements to measure network performance to provide
   Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

   [RFC6374] specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and
   accurate measurement of performance metrics in MPLS networks using
   query and response messages.  [RFC7876] specifies mechanisms for
   sending and processing out-of-band responses over an UDP return path
   when receiving RFC 6374 based query messages.  These mechanisms are
   also well-suited in SR-MPLS networks.

   This document utilizes the mechanisms defined in [RFC6374] for
   Performance Delay and Loss Measurements in SR-MPLS networks, for both
   SR-MPLS links and end-to-end SR-MPLS paths including Policies.  In
   addition, this document defines Return Path TLV and Block Number TLV
   extensions for [RFC6374].

   message may be sent back to the querier node Q1 in-band on the same
   path (same set of links and nodes) or a different path in the reverse
   direction.

   SR is enabled with MPLS data plane on nodes Q1 and R1.  The nodes Q1
   and R1 may be directly connected via a link enabled with MPLS
   (Section 2.9.1 of [RFC6374]) or a Point-to-Point (P2P) SR-MPLS path
   [RFC8402].  The link may be a physical interface, virtual link, or
   Link Aggregation Group (LAG) [IEEE802.1AX], or LAG member link.  The
   SR-MPLS path may be an SR-MPLS Policy
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] on node Q1 (called head-end)
   with destination to node R1 (called tail-end).

3.  Overview

   For delay and loss measurement in SR-MPLS networks, the procedures
   defined in [RFC6374] are used in this document.  Note that the one-
   way, two-way and round-trip delay measurements are defined in
   Section 2.4 of [RFC6374] and are further described in this document
   for SR-MPLS networks.  Similarly, the packet loss measurement is
   defined in Section 2.2 of [RFC6374] and is further described in this
   document for SR-MPLS networks.

   In SR-MPLS networks, the query and response messages defined in
   [RFC6374] are sent as following:

   *  For delay measurement, the query messages MUST be sent in-band (on
      the same path as data traffic) for SR-MPLS links and end-to-end
      SR-MPLS paths to collect transmit and receive timestamps.

   *  For loss measurement, the query messages MUST be sent in-band (on
      the same path as data traffic) for SR-MPLS links and end-to-end
      SR-MPLS paths to collect transmit and receive traffic counters
      (e.g. for traffic received on the incoming link for the link
      packet loss and for the incoming Path Segment Identifier (PSID)
      [I-D.ietf-spring-mpls-path-segment] for the end-to-end SR-MPLS
      path packet loss).

Internet-Draft     Using RFC 6374 for SR-MPLS Networks     February 2022


   It may be desired in SR-MPLS networks that the same path (same set of
   links and nodes) between the querier and responder be used in both
   directions of the measurement.  This is achieved by using the SR-MPLS
   Return Path TLV extension defined in this document.

   The packet loss measurement using Alternate-Marking Method defined in
   [RFC8321] requires collecting Block Number of the traffic counters.
   This is achieved by using the Block Number TLV extension defined in
   this document.

   The performance measurement procedure for SR-MPLS links can be used
   to compute extended Traffic Engineering (TE) metrics for delay and
   loss as described in this document.  The metrics are advertised in
   the network using the routing protocol extensions defined in
   [RFC7471], [RFC8570], and [RFC8571].

4.  Query and Response Messages

   As described in Section 2.9.1 of [RFC6374], the query and response
   messages flow over an MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh).  These
   query and response messages contain G-ACh Label (GAL) (value 13, with
   S=1).  The GAL is followed by an Associated Channel Header (ACH),
   where Channel Type identifies the measurement message type, and the
   message payload following the ACH as shown in Figure 2.

4.1.1.  Query Message for SR-MPLS Links

   A query message as shown in Figure 2 is sent over the SR-MPLS links
   for both delay and loss measurement using the procedures described in
   [RFC6374].  For SR-MPLS links, the TTL value MUST be set to 255 in
   the SR-MPLS header.  SR-MPLS encapsulation (e.g. using adjacency SID
   of the link) can be added for transmitting the query messages for SR-
   MPLS links.

4.1.2.  Query Message for SR-MPLS Policies

   An SR-MPLS Policy may contain a number of Segment Lists (SLs) (i.e.
   stack of MPLS labels) [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].  The
   query messages MUST be transmitted for each SL of the SR-MPLS Policy.
   A query message for an end-to-end SR-MPLS Policy, for both delay and
   loss measurement, contains an SR-MPLS label stack, with the G-ACh
   Label (GAL) at the bottom of the stack (with S=1) as shown in
   Figure 3.  For SR-MPLS Policies, the TTL value MUST be set to 255 in
   the SR-MPLS header.

   The SR-MPLS label stack can be empty (format as shown in Figure 2) to
   indicate the Implicit NULL label case.

   For an SR-MPLS Policy, in order to ensure that the query message is
   processed by the intended responder, Destination Address TLV (Type
   129) [RFC6374] containing the address of the responder can be sent in
   the query message.  The responder that supports this TLV MUST return
   Success in "Control Code" [RFC6374] if it is the intended destination
   for the query.  Otherwise, it MUST return 0x15: Error - Invalid
   Destination Node Identifier [RFC6374].  The Destination Address TLV
   is applicable to P2P SR-MPLS Policy only.

4.2.1.  One-way Measurement Mode

   In one-way measurement mode defined in Section 2.4 of [RFC6374], the
   querier can receive "out-of-band" response messages with IP/UDP
   header by properly setting the UDP Return Object (URO) TLV in the
   query message.  The URO TLV (Type=131) is defined in [RFC7876] and
   includes the UDP-Destination-Port and IP Address.  When the querier
   sets an IP address and an UDP port in the URO TLV, the response
   message MUST be sent to that IP address as the destination address
   and UDP port as the destination port.  In addition, the "Control
   Code" in the query message MUST be set to "out-of-band response
   requested" [RFC6374].

   In one-way delay measurement mode, as per Reference Topology in
   Figure 1, the timestamps T1 and T2 are collected by the query and
   response messages.  Both these timestamps are used to measure one-way
   delay as (T2 - T1).

4.2.2.  Two-way Measurement Mode

   In two-way measurement mode defined in Section 2.4 of [RFC6374], the
   response messages are preferred to be sent back in-band on the same
   link or the same end-to-end SR-MPLS path (same set of links and
   nodes) in the reverse direction to the querier.

   For SR-MPLS links, the response message (format as shown in Figure 2)
   is sent back on the same incoming link where the query message is
   received.  In this case, the "Control Code" in the query message MUST
   be set to "in-band response requested" [RFC6374].

   For end-to-end SR-MPLS paths, the responder transmits the response
   message (example as shown in Figure 3) on a specific return SR-MPLS
   path [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path].  The querier can request in the
   query message to the responder to send the response message back on a
   given return path using the SR-MPLS Segment List sub-TLV in the
   Return Path TLV defined in this document.

   In two-way delay measurement mode, as per Reference Topology in
   Figure 1, all four timestamps T1, T2, T3, and T4 are collected by the
   query and response messages.  All four timestamps are used to measure
   two-way delay as ((T4 - T1) - (T3 - T2)).

Internet-Draft     Using RFC 6374 for SR-MPLS Networks     February 2022


4.2.3.  Loopback Measurement Mode

   The Loopback measurement mode defined in Section 2.8 of [RFC6374] is
   used to measure round-trip delay for a bidirectional circular SR-MPLS
   path [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path].  In this mode, the received query
   messages MUST NOT be punted out of the fast path in forwarding (i.e.
   to slow path or control- plane) at the responder.  In other words,
   the responder does not process the payload and generate response
   messages.  The loopback function simply returns the received query
   message to the querier without responder modifications [RFC6374].

   The loopback mode is done by generating "queries" with the Response
   flag set to 1 and adding the Loopback Request object (Type 3)
   [RFC6374].  The label stack in query messages in this case carry both
   the forward and reverse paths in the MPLS header.  The GAL is still
   carried at the bottom of the label stack (with S=1) (example as shown
   in Figure 3).

   In loopback delay measurement mode, as per Reference Topology in
   Figure 1, the timestamps T1 and T4 are collected by the query
   messages.  Both these timestamps are used to measure round-trip delay
   as (T4 - T1).  In this mode, the round-trip delay includes the
   processing delay on the responder.  The responder processing delay
   component includes only the time required to loop the test packet
   from the incoming interface to the outgoing interface in forwarding
   plane.

5.1.  Delay Measurement Message Format

   As defined in [RFC6374], MPLS DM query and response messages use
   Associated Channel Header (ACH) (value 0x000C for delay measurement)
   [RFC6374], which identifies the message type, and the message payload
   following the ACH.  For both SR-MPLS links and end-to-end SR-MPLS
   Policies, the same MPLS DM ACH value MUST be used.

   The DM message payload as defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC6374] is used
   for delay measurement, for both SR-MPLS links and end-to-end SR-MPLS
   Policies.

5.2.  Timestamps

   The Section 3.4 of [RFC6374] defines timestamp format that can be
   used for delay measurement.  The IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol
   (PTP) timestamp format [IEEE1588] is used by default as described in
   Appendix A of [RFC6374].

6.  Loss Measurement

   The LM protocol can perform two distinct kinds of loss measurement as
   described in Section 2.9.8 of [RFC6374].

   *  In inferred mode, LM will measure the loss of specially generated
      test messages in order to infer the approximate data plane loss
      level.  Inferred mode LM provides only approximate loss
      accounting.

   *  In direct mode, LM will directly measure data plane packet loss.
      Direct mode LM provides perfect loss accounting, but may require
      hardware support.

6.1.  Loss Measurement Message Format

   As defined in [RFC6374], MPLS LM query and response messages use
   Associated Channel Header (ACH) (value 0x000A for direct loss
   measurement or value 0x000B for inferred loss measurement), which
   identifies the message type, and the message payload following the
   ACH.  For both SR-MPLS links and end-to-end SR-MPLS Policies, the
   same MPLS LM ACH value MUST be used.

   The LM message payload as defined in Section 3.1 of [RFC6374] is used
   for loss measurement, for both SR-MPLS links and end-to-end SR-MPLS
   Policies.

6.2.  Combined Loss/Delay Measurement Message Format

   As defined in [RFC6374], Combined DM+LM query and response messages
   use Associated Channel Header (ACH) (value 0x000D for direct loss and
   delay measurement or value 0x000E for inferred loss and delay
   measurement), which identifies the message type, and the message
   payload following the ACH.  For both SR-MPLS links and end-to-end SR-
   MPLS Policies, the same MPLS DM+LM ACH value MUST be used.

   The message payload as defined in Section 3.3 of [RFC6374] is used
   for combined delay and loss measurement, for both SR-MPLS links and
   end-to-end SR-MPLS Policies.

6.3.  Counters

   The Path Segment Identifier (PSID)
   [I-D.ietf-spring-mpls-path-segment] carried in the received data
   packet for the traffic flow under measurement can be used for
   accounting received traffic on the egress node of the SR-MPLS Policy.
   In direct mode, the PSID in the received query message as shown in
   Figure 4 can be used to associate the receive traffic counter on the

   responder to detect the transmit packet loss for the end-to-end SR-
   MPLS Policy.

   In inferred mode, the PSID in the received query messages as shown in
   Figure 4 can be used to count the received query messages on the
   responder to detect the transmit packet loss for an end-to-end SR-
   MPLS Policy.

     Figure 4: Example With Path Segment Identifier for SR-MPLS Policy

   Different values of PSID can be used to measure packet loss per SR-
   MPLS Policy, per Candidate Path or per Segment List of the SR-MPLS
   Policy [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

7.  TLV Extensions

7.1.  Return Path TLV Extension

   In two-way measurement mode, the responder transmits the response
   message on a specific return path.  The querier can request in the
   query message to the responder to send a response message back on a
   given return path (e.g. co-routed SR-MPLS path for two-way
   measurement).  This way the responder avoids creating and maintaining
   extra dynamic SR states for the return paths for two-way measurement.

   The querier may not be reachable from the responder.  The querier in
   this case MUST send its reachability path information to the
   responder using the Return Path TLV.

   [RFC6374] defines query and response messages those can include or
   more optional TLVs.  New TLV Type (TBA1) is defined in this document
   for Return Path TLV to carry return path information in query
   messages.  The format of the Return Path TLV is shown in Figure 5:

                         Figure 5: Return Path TLV

   The Return Path TLV is a Mandatory TLV Type.  The querier MUST only
   insert one Return Path TLV in the query message.  The responder that
   supports this TLV, MUST only process the first Return Path TLV and
   ignore the other Return Path TLVs if present.  The responder that
   supports this TLV, also MUST send response message back on the return
   path specified in the Return Path TLV.  The responder also MUST NOT
   add Return Path TLV in the response message.  The Reserved field MUST
   be set to 0 and MUST be ignored on the receive side.

7.1.1.  Return Path Sub-TLV Extension

   The Return Path TLV contains a Sub-TLV to carry the return path.  The
   format of the SR-MPLS Segment List Sub-TLV is shown in Figure 6.  The
   SR-MPLS Segment List Sub-TLV contains SR-MPLS Label Stack.  The Label
   entries in the Segment List MUST be in network order.  The SR-MPLS
   Segment List Sub-TLV in the Return Path TLV is of the following Type:

   *  Type (value 1): SR-MPLS Segment List of the Return Path

   An SR-MPLS Segment List Sub-TLV may carry only Binding SID
   [I-D.ietf-pce-binding-label-sid] of the Return SR-MPLS Policy.

   The Return Path TLV MUST carry only one Return Path Sub-TLV.  The
   responder that supports this Sub-TLV, MUST only process the first
   Return Path Sub-TLV and ignore the other Return Path Sub-TLVs if
   present.  The responder that supports this Sub-TLV, also MUST send
   response message back on the return path specified in the Return Path
   Sub-TLV.  The Reserved field MUST be set to 0 and MUST be ignored on
   the receive side.

   Note that in addition to the P2P SR-MPLS paths, the SR-MPLS Segment
   List Sub-TLV is also applicable to the P2MP SR-MPLS paths.  For
   example, for P2MP SR-MPLS paths, it may only carry the Node Segment
   Identifier of the querier in order for the response to follow an SR-
   MPLS path back to the querier.

7.2.  Block Number TLV Extension

   The direct mode loss measurement using Alternate-Marking Method
   defined in [RFC8321] requires collecting Block Number of the counters
   for the data traffic flow under measurement.  To be able to correlate
   the transmit and receive traffic counters of the matching Block
   Number, the Block Number of the traffic counters is carried in the LM
   query and response messages.

   [RFC6374] defines query and response messages those can include one
   or more optional TLVs.  New TLV Type (value TBA2) is defined in this
   document to carry the Block Number (8-bit) of the traffic counters in
   the LM query and response messages.  The format of the Block Number
   TLV is shown in Figure 7:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   The Block Number TLV is a Mandatory TLV Type.  The querier MUST only
   insert one Block Number TLV in the query message to identify the
   Block Number for the traffic counters in the forward direction.  The
   responder that supports this TLV, MUST only inert one Block Number
   TLV in the response message to identify the Block Number for the
   traffic counters in the reverse direction.  The responder also MUST
   return the first Block Number TLV from the query message and ignore
   the other Block Number TLVs if present.  The R Flag MUST be clear in
   the query message and set in the response message.  The Reserved
   field MUST be set to 0 and MUST be ignored on the receive side.

8.  Performance Measurement for P2MP SR-MPLS Policies

   The Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) SR-MPLS path that originates from a
   root node terminates on multiple destinations called leaf nodes (e.g.
   P2MP SR-MPLS Policy [I-D.ietf-pim-sr-p2mp-policy]).

   The procedures for delay and loss measurement described in this
   document for end-to-end P2P SR-MPLS Policies are also equally
   applicable to the P2MP SR-MPLS Policies.  The procedure for one-way
   measurement is defined as following:

   *  The querier root node transmits query messages using the Tree-SID
      defined in [I-D.ietf-pim-sr-p2mp-policy] for the P2MP SR-MPLS
      Policy as shown in Figure 8.  The query messages may contain the
      replication SID as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-replication-segment].

   *  Each responder leaf node MUST send its node address in the "Source
      Address" TLV (Type 130) [RFC6374] in the response messages.  This
      TLV allows the querier root node to identify the responder leaf
      nodes of the P2MP SR-MPLS Policy.

   *  The P2MP root node measures the delay and loss performance for
      each P2MP leaf node individually.

   The considerations for two-way measurement mode (e.g. for co-routed
   bidirectional SR-MPLS path) and loopback measurement mode for P2MP
   SR-MPLS Policy are outside the scope of this document.

9.  ECMP for SR-MPLS Policies

   An SR-MPLS Policy can have ECMPs between the source and transit
   nodes, between transit nodes and between transit and destination
   nodes.  Usage of Anycast SID [RFC8402] by an SR-MPLS Policy can
   result in ECMP paths via transit nodes part of that Anycast group.
   The query and response messages SHOULD be sent to traverse different
   ECMP paths to measure delay of each of the ECMP path of an SR-MPLS
   Policy.

   Forwarding plane has various hashing functions available to forward
   packets on specific ECMP paths.  For SR-MPLS Policy, sweeping of
   entropy label [RFC6790] values can be used in query and response
   messages to take advantage of the hashing function in forwarding
   plane to influence the ECMP path taken by them.

   The considerations for loss measurement for different ECMP paths of
   an SR-MPLS Policy are outside the scope of this document.

10.  SR-MPLS Link Extended TE Metrics Advertisements

   The extended TE metrics for SR-MPLS link delay and loss can be
   computed using the performance measurement procedures described in
   this document to advertise in the routing domain as follows:







Gandhi, et al.          Expires 1 September 2022               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft     Using RFC 6374 for SR-MPLS Networks     February 2022


   *  For OSPF, ISIS, and BGP-LS, protocol extensions defined in
      [RFC7471], [RFC8570], and [RFC8571], respectively, are used for
      advertising the extended TE link delay and loss metrics in the
      network.

   *  The extended TE link delay and loss metrics are advertised for
      Layer-2 LAG bundle member links in OSPF
      [I-D.ietf-lsr-ospf-l2bundles] and ISIS [RFC8668] using the same
      protocol extensions defined in [RFC7471] and [RFC8570],
      respectively.

   *  The advertised delay-variance metric, Packet Delay Variation (PDV)
      is computed as described in Section 4.2 of [RFC5481].

   *  In the absence of one-way delay measurement, the extended TE link
      one-way delay metrics can be computed using the two-way and round-
      trip delay values by dividing the values by 2.

11.  Backwards Compatibility

   The procedures defined in this document are backwards compatible with
   the procedures defined in [RFC6374] at both querier and responder.
   If the responder does not support the new Mandatory TLV Types defined
   in this document, it MUST return Error 0x17: Unsupported Mandatory
   TLV Object as per [RFC6374].

12.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the procedures for performance delay and loss
   measurement for SR-MPLS networks, for both SR-MPLS links and end-to-
   end SR-MPLS Policies using the mechanisms defined in [RFC6374] and
   [RFC7876].  The security considerations covered in [RFC6374],
   [RFC7471], [RFC8570], [RFC8571], and [RFC7876] also apply to the
   procedures in this document.

   The procedure defined in this document is intended for deployment in
   limited domains [RFC8799].  As such, it assumes that a querier node
   involved in the measurement operation has previously verified the
   integrity of the path and the identity of the far-end responder.

   If desired, attacks can be mitigated by performing basic validation
   and sanity checks, at the querier, of the timestamp and counter
   fields in received response messages.  The minimal state associated
   with these protocols also limits the extent of measurement disruption
   that can be caused by a corrupt or invalid message to a single test
   cycle.

Internet-Draft     Using RFC 6374 for SR-MPLS Networks     February 2022


   The extensions defined in this document may be used for potential
   "proxying" attacks.  For example, a querier may specify a return path
   that has a destination different from that of the responder.  But
   normally, such attacks will not happen in an SR-MPLS domain where the
   queriers and responders belong to the same domain [RFC8799].  In
   order to prevent using the extension defined in this document for
   proxying any possible attacks, the return path has destination to the
   same node where the forward path is from.  The responder may drop the
   query messages when it cannot determine whether the Return Path has
   the destination to the querier.  That means, the querier may send a
   proper source address in the "Source Address" TLV according to the
   specified Return Path to help the responder to make that decision.

13.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate values for the following Mandatory TLV
   Types for [RFC6374] from the "MPLS Loss/Delay Measurement TLV Object"
   registry contained within the "Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh)
   Parameters" registry set:

   The Block Number TLV is carried in the query and response messages
   and Return Path TLV is carried in the query messages.

   IANA is requested to create a sub-registry for "Return Path Sub-TLV
   Type".  All code points in the range 1 through 175 in this registry
   shall be allocated according to the "IETF Review" procedure as
   specified in [RFC8126].  Code points in the range 176 through 239 in
   this registry shall be allocated according to the "First Come First
   Served" procedure as specified in [RFC8126].  Remaining code points
   are allocated according to Table 2:
