  Transmission of SCHC-compressed packets over IEEE 802.15.4 networks
                     draft-gomez-6lo-schc-15dot4-00

Abstract

   A framework called Static Context Header Compression and
   fragmentation (SCHC) has been designed with the primary goal of
   supporting IPv6 over Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies
   [RFC8724].  One of the SCHC components is a header compression
   mechanism.  If used properly, SCHC header compression allows a
   greater compression ratio than that achievable with traditional
   6LoWPAN header compression [RFC6282].  For this reason, it may make
   sense to use SCHC header compression in some 6LoWPAN environments,
   including IEEE 802.15.4 networks.  This document specifies how a
   SCHC-compressed packet can be carried over IEEE 802.15.4 networks.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 6282 is the main specification for IPv6 over Low power Wireless
   Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) IPv6 header compression [RFC6282].
   This RFC was designed assuming IEEE 802.15.4 as the layer below the
   6LoWPAN adaptation layer, and it has also been reused (with proper
   adaptations) for IPv6 header compression over many other technologies
   relatively similar to IEEE 802.15.4 in terms of characteristics such
   as physical layer bit rate, layer 2 maximum payload size, etc.
   Examples of such technologies comprise BLE, DECT-ULE, ITU G.9959, MS/
   TP, NFC, and PLC.  RFC 6282 provides additional functionality, such
   as a mechanism for UDP header compression.

   In the best cases, RFC 6282 allows to compress a 40-byte IPv6 header
   down to a 2-byte compressed header (for link-local interactions) or a
   3-byte compressed header (when global IPv6 addresses are used).  On
   the other hand, an RFC 6282 compressed UDP header has a typical size
   of 4 bytes.  Therefore, in advantageous conditions, a 48-byte
   uncompressed IPv6/UDP header may be compressed down to a 6-byte

   format (when using link-local addresses) or a 7-byte format (for
   global interactions) by using RFC 6282.

   Recently, a framework called Static Context Header Compression (SCHC)
   has been designed with the primary goal of supporting IPv6 over Low
   Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies [RFC8724].  SCHC
   comprises header compression and fragmentation functionality tailored
   to the extraordinary constraints of LPWAN technologies, which are
   more severe than those exhibited by IEEE 802.15.4 or other relatively
   similar technologies.  SCHC header compression allows a greater
   compression ratio than that of RFC 6282.  If used properly, SCHC
   allows to compress an IPv6/UDP header down to e.g. a single byte.  In
   addition, SCHC can be used to compress Constrained Application
   Protocol (CoAP) headers as well [RFC7252][RFC8824], which further
   increases the achievable performance improvement of using SCHC header
   compression, since there is no 6LoWPAN header compression defined for
   CoAP.  Therefore, it may make sense to use SCHC header compression in
   some 6LoWPAN environments [I-D.toutain-6lo-6lo-and-schc], including
   IEEE 802.15.4 networks, considering its greater efficiency.

   If SCHC header compression is added to the panoply of header
   compression mechanisms used in 6LoWPAN environments, then there is a
   need to signal when a packet header has been compressed by using
   SCHC.  To this end, in its current form, the present document
   specifies a 6LoWPAN Dispatch Type for SCHC header compression, based
   on exploiting RFC 8025 Dispatch type space [RFC8025].

   This document specifies how a SCHC-compressed packet can be carried
   over IEEE 802.15.4 networks.  Note that, as per this document, and
   while SCHC defines fragmentation mechanisms as well, 6LoWPAN/6Lo
   fragmentation is used when necessary to transport SCHC-compressed
   packets over IEEE 802.15.4 networks [RFC4944][RFC8931].

   TO-DO: indicate here any specific updates of RFC 8724 for IEEE
   802.15.4.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP14 [RFC2119], [RFC8174], when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.2.  Background on SCHC

   The reader is expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   defined in the specification of SCHC (RFC 8724).

3.  Architecture

3.1.  Network topologies

   IEEE 802.15.4 supports two main network topologies: the star
   topology, and the peer-to-peer (i.e., mesh) topology.

   SCHC has been designed for LPWAN technologies, which are typically
   based on a star topology where constrained devices (e.g., sensors)
   communicate with a less constrained, central network gateway [RFC
   8376].  However, as stated in [draft-ietf-lpwan-architecture], SCHC
   is generic and it can also be used in networking environments beyond
   the ones originally considered for SCHC.

   SCHC compression is applicable to both star topology and mesh
   topology IEEE 802.15.4 networks.

3.2.  Protocol stack

   The traditional 6LoWPAN-based protocol stack for constrained devices
   (Figure 1, left) places the 6LoWPAN adaptation layer between IPv6 and
   an underlying technology such as IEEE 802.15.4.  Suitable upper layer
   protocols include CoAP [RFC7252] and UDP.  (Note that, while CoAP has
   also been specified over TCP, and TCP may play a significant role in
   IoT environments [RFC9006], 6LoWPAN header compression has not been
   defined for TCP.)

   6LoWPAN can be envisioned as a set of two main sublayers, where the
   upper one provides header compression, while the lower one offers
   fragmentation.

   This document defines an alternative approach for packet header
   compression over IEEE 802.15.4, which leads to a modified protocol
   stack (Figure 1, right).

    compression (right).  HC and Frag stand for Header Compression and
                       Fragmentation, respectively.

   SCHC header compression may be applied to the headers of different
   protocols or sets of protocols.  Some examples include: i) IPv6
   packet headers, ii) joint IPv6 and UDP packet headers, iii) joint
   IPv6, UDP and CoAP packet headers, etc.

4.  Frame Format

   This document defines the frame format to be used when a SCHC-
   compressed packet is carried over IEEE 802.15.4.  Such format is
   carried as IEEE 802.15.4 frame payload.  The format comprises a SCHC
   Dispatch Type, a SCHC Packet (i.e. a SCHC-compressed packet (RFC
   8724), and Padding bits, if any).  Figure 2 illustrates the described
   frame format.


               <---------- IEEE 802.15.4 frame payload ---------->

                               <----- SCHC Packet ----->

Internet-Draft          SCHC compression for 6Lo               July 2021


4.1.  SCHC Dispatch

   Adding SCHC header compression to the panoply of header compression
   mechanisms used in 6LoWPAN/6Lo environments creates the need to
   signal when a packet header has been compressed by using SCHC.  To
   this end, the present document specifies the SCHC Dispatch.  The SCHC
   Dispatch indicates that the next field in the frame format is a SCHC-
   compressed header.  The latter corresponds to a packet header that
   has been compressed by using SCHC.  As defined in [RFC8724], the SCHC
   Header comprises a RuleID, and a compression residue.

   This document defines the SCHC Dispatch as a 6LoWPAN Dispatch Type
   for SCHC header compression, based on exploiting RFC 8025 Dispatch
   type space and the concept of "pages" [RFC8025].  With the aim to
   minimize overhead, the present document allocates a whole page (Page
   2) for the SCHC Dispatch Type:

   SCHC Dispatch Type bit pattern: 11110010 (Page 2) (Note: to be
   confirmed by IANA))

   TO-DO: RuleID discussion

4.2.  Padding

   If SCHC header compression leads to a SCHC Packet size of a non-
   integer number of bytes, padding bits of value equal to zero MUST be
   appended to the SCHC Packet as appropriate to align to an octet
   boundary.

5.  SCHC compression for IPv6, UDP, and CoAP headers

   SCHC header compression may be applied to the headers of different
   protocols or sets of protocols.  Some examples include: i) IPv6
   packet headers, ii) joint IPv6 and UDP packet headers, iii) joint
   IPv6, UDP and CoAP packet headers, etc.

   IPv6 and UDP header fields MUST be compressed as per Section 10 of
   RFC 8724.

   TO-DO: adaptation of DevIID and AppIID in 802.15.4 environments

   CoAP header fields MUST be compressed as per Sections 4 to 6 of RFC
   8824.

   TO-DO: provide examples for IPv6-only, IPv6/UDP and IPv6/UDP/CoAP.

Internet-Draft          SCHC compression for 6Lo               July 2021


6.  Fragmentation and reassembly

   After applying SCHC header compression to a packet intended for
   transmission, if the size of the resulting frame format (Section 4)
   exceeds the IEEE 802.15.4 frame payload space available, such frame
   format MUST be fragmented, carried and reassembled by means of
   6LoWPAN fragmentation and reassembly [RFC4944][RFC8931].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the allocation of the Dispatch Type Field bit
   pattern 11110010 (Page 2) as SCHC Dispatch Type.

8.  Security Considerations

   TBD
