            Diversity Routing for the Babel Routing Protocol
              draft-chroboczek-babel-diversity-routing-00

Abstract

   This document defines an extension to the Babel routing protocol that
   allows routing updates to carry radio frequency information, and
   therefore makes it possible to use radio diversity information for
   route selection.

1.  Introduction and background

   The Babel routing protocol [BABEL] does not mandate a specific
   algorithm for computing metrics; Appendix A of that document suggests
   using an additive integer metric.  While this works well in many
   topologies, it fails to take into account the possibility of
   interference between radio links, which is important in multi-
   frequency wireless mesh networks.

   Consider for example the following topology, where the solid lines
   use one radio frequency and the dashed lines another, and suppose
   that the solid frequency has very slightly lower packet loss than the
   dashed one:

      B
     / \
    /   \
   A     D
    \   .
     \ .
      C

   When sending data from A to D, Babel will reliably choose the solid
   route through B.  Howerver, this route self-interferes: when B is
   sending a packet to D, it cannot simultaneously be receiving a packet
   from A, which halves the effective throughput.  No such issue arises
   with the route through C, which should therefore be preferred.

   Interference needs to be taken into account even when it happens
   between non-adjacent links.  Consider the following topology:

      B +++ C
     /       \
    /         \
   A           F
    \         .
     \       .
      D +++ E

   When routing data from A to F, the route through B and C has two
   interfering links: if two packets are sent by A and C at roughly the
   same time, a collision will occur, and both packets will need to be
   resent.  Again, no such issue arises with the route through D and E.

2.  Operation of the protocol

   The diversity protocol extension allows a Babel router to attach
   information about radio frequency to the routes that it maintains --
   we call this the route's "diversity information".

   We assume that all links can be categorised into one of the following
   categories:

   o  non-interfering links, e.g. wired links;

   o  links that have a well defined frequency, and only interfere with
      other links at the same frequency; these are described by a single
      channel number, an integer between 1 and 254;

   o  interfering links, links that interfere with all other links
      except non-interfering links.

   This model does not describe reality accurately, since distinct but
   close radio frequencies do in fact interfere, but it works well
   enough in practical networks, where a small number of discrete radio
   frequencies are used.

2.1.  Changes to data structures

   A Babel router maintains a route table ([BABEL] Section 3.2.5).  A
   router implementing diversity routing has one additional field in
   every route table entry:

   o  the diversity data, a (possibly zero-length) sequence of channel
      numbers, each of which is an integer between 1 and 255.

Internet-Draft           Babel Diversity Routing               July 2014


   The diversity data is interpreted as the set of channels of the links
   that would be followed by a packet sent along this route, omitting
   non-interfering links.  The value 255 is special -- it indicates an
   interfering link.

2.2.  Receiving updates

   When a node receives an Update TLV, it creates or updates a routing
   table entry according to [BABEL], Section 3.5.4.  A node that
   performs diversity routing extends the procedure given in that
   section with the following procedure.

   Let D be the diversity information attached to the received Update
   TLV, or the one-element sequence 255 if there is no such information.
   Then the routing table entry diversity information is set to D',
   where:

   o  if the interface over which the update was received is non-
      interfering, then D'=D;

   o  if the interface over which the update was received is tuned to
      channel C, then D'=C.D;

   o  if the interface over which the update was received is
      interfering, then D'=255.D.

   Note that zero-length diversity information is different from lack of
   diversity information: the latter is treated as 255 (interfering,
   since no information is available) in order to ensure
   interoperability with the original Babel protocol.

2.3.  Sending updates

   A Babel node sends updates in various circumstances, described in
   [BABEL], Section 3.7.  A node performing diversity routing attaches
   diversity data to every update that it send.  This diversity data is
   computed as follows:

   o  if the update is for a locally redistributed route, then the value
      is implementation-dependent (zero-length diversity information is
      a good choice);

   o  if the update is for a route in the Babel route table, then the
      diversity information is taken from the route table.

2.4.  Metric computation and route selection

   How the diversity data is used for metric computation and/or route
   selection is left to the implementation, as long as it obeys the
   rules given in Sections 3.5.2 and 3.6 of [BABEL].  In particular, the
   strict monotonicity requirement implies that a non-interfering hop
   must be taken into account in the resulting metric -- it cannot be
   simply ignored.

   An algorithm that has been found to work relatively well in practice
   is given in Appendix A.

2.5.  Protocol encoding

   We define one new sub-TLV which is attached to Update TLVs and
   contains a sequence of channel numbers.

2.5.1.  Encoding of channel numbers

   A channel number is encoded as a one-octet integer.  The following
   values are used by the current implementation:

   0  This value is reserved, MUST NOT be sent, and MUST be silently
      filtered out on reception;

   1-14  IEEE 802.11b channels;

   36-165  IEEE 802.11a channels;

   255  used to represent an interfering link.

   Other values are not currently used, and MAY be used by mutual
   agreement to represent radio frequencies not covered by the above.

2.5.2.  The Diversity sub-TLV

   Diversity data is carried in a Diversity sub-TLV [BABEL-EXT] that is
   carried by Update TLVs.  The sub-TLV contains a sequence of octets
   that directly encode the diversity data from the route table.

Appendix A.  The Z3 algorithm

   In this section, we describe the Z3 algorithm, a particular instance
   of diversity routing that has seen some modest deployment and that
   appears to work reasonably well in practice while being extremely
   easy to implement.

   The Z3 algorithm works by announcing a slightly smaller metric than
   the metric it uses for route selection when announcing over a non-
   interfering link.  In effect, a Z3 router maintains two metrics for
   each route: the noninterfering metric, which is announced on links
   that can be proven to not interfere with the route being announced,
   and the interfering metric, which is used for route selection and
   announced over all other links.

   More precisely, upon receiving an update with metric M over a link
   with cost C, the interfering metric is set to C+M, as suggested in
   Appendix A of [BABEL].  The non-interfering metric is set to
   alpha*C+M, where 0<alpha<1 is called the diversity factor (with
   rounding biased upwards in order to ensure strict monotonicity).

   Let D be the diversity data of route R, and L be a link.  We say that
   R interferes with L when one of the following is true:

   o  L is a non-interfering link (e.g. an Ethernet); or

   o  L is a radio interface tuned to channel C, and neither C nor 255
      is an element of D.

   When we announce R over L, we announce the interfering metric if R
   interferes with L, and the non-interfering metric otherwise.

   The metric that Z3 yields is non-isotonic; hence, Z3 Babel does not
   necessarily converge to a set of minimum-metric routes.  In fact, the
   set of minimum-metric routes might not even be a tree in the general
   case.  The author believes that Z3 Babel converges to a Nash
   equilibrium, but this appears to be a difficult property to prove.
