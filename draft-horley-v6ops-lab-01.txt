                    Expanding the IPv6 Lab Use Space
                       draft-horley-v6ops-lab-01

Abstract

   To reduce the likelihood of addressing conflicts and confusion
   between lab deployments and non-lab (i.e., production) deployments,
   an IPv6 unicast address prefix is reserved for use in lab, proof-of-
   concept, and validation networks as well as for for any similar use
   case.  This document describes the use of the IPv6 address prefix
   0200::/7 as a prefix reserved for this purpose (repurposing the
   deprecated OSI NSAP-mapped prefix).

1.  Introduction

   The address architecture for IPv6 ([RFC4291]) does not explicitly
   define any prefixes allocated exclusively for lab use, nor is such
   address space allocated in [RFC6890] or in [RFC8200].  While lab
   deployments could potentially use IPv6 address prefixes typically
   assigned and configured in non-lab network, the use of such
   addressing in lab environments may create addressing conflicts and
   operational confusion.  For instance, designing labs utilizing ULA
   fc00::/7 [RFC4193] is problematic due to the random global ID
   requirement preventing hierarchical network prefix design
   possibilities.  Further, default address selection behavior [RFC6724]
   by end nodes may result in a depreferencing of such addresses and
   prevent lab deployments from accurately modeling their desired non-
   lab equivalents.

   To resolve these problems involved in building large scale lab
   networks, and pre-staging, or automating large-scale networks for
   deployment, this document allocates the IPv6 address prefix 0200::/7
   for these purposes.

   The goal is to allow organization to share working lab configuration
   files (with little or no need of modification) to be deployed in a
   third party lab environment like,

   public and private clouds,

   virtualization or hosting environments,

   and in other networks like Service Providers, Enterprise, Government,
   IoT, and Energy,

   all with the knowledge that the lab GUA address space will perform
   the same as any GUA but with the added knowledge that filtering will
   be used to protect accidential leaks to the Internet.

   The following criteria is for selecting the lab prefix:

   The precendence for the lab prefix should no be lower than the GUA
   prefix as defined in [RFC6724] (unlike ULA).  Reduce the operational
   impacts to IANA and the RIR's in selecting lab prefix space.

2.  New Lab IPv6 Address Prefix

   The prefix reserved for lab and testing purposes is 0200::/7.

3.  Operational Implications

   This space SHOULD NOT be employed for addressing use cases which are
   already defined in other RFCs, such as addresses set apart for
   documentation, testing, etc.

   Enterprise and large scale networks have some specific criteria
   around building and validating prior to deployment.  The issues with
   ULA for infrastructure modeling and labbing at the host level are
   more impactful in large enterprises.  This is due to the increased
   focus on large scale hosts, servers and apps testing.  Also, it is
   likely that both GUA and ULA may co-exist (or are planned) and
   reconfiguring lab hosts and networks isn't practical or desirable due
   to inconsistent results for host preference due to [RFC6724]
   behavior.

   Most large enterprises strive to build lab, dev, and qa environments
   that reflect production as accurately as possible.  This is a fairly
   straightforward way to avoid disparity between production and non-
   production.  Enterprise environments is an area that needs increased
   IPv6 adoption.  In an effort to make it easier to model a global
   enterprise and to avoid the pitfalls of ULA de-preferenced host

   behavior or squatting on other IPv6 space, a specific IPv6 lab prefix
   is being assigned.

   Because this address prefix has previously been used for the OSI
   NSAP-mapped prefix set in [RFC4048] and [RFC4548], and deprecated,
   this address prefix is already limited in its usability.  In
   addition, the address prefix was returned to IANA and is available to
   be marked for lab or other purposes.

   This assignment implies that IPv6 network operators SHOULD add this
   address prefix to the list of non-routeable IPv6 address space, and
   if packet filters are deployed, then this address prefix SHOULD be
   added to packet filters.  This is not a local-use address prefix so
   these filters may be used in both local and public contexts.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is to record the reservation of the IPv6 global unicast address
   prefix 0200::/7 as a lab-only prefix in the IPv6 address registry.
   No end party is to be assigned this address.

5.  Security Considerations

   The addresses assigned for lab and staging use SHOULD be filtered as
   noted above.

   Setting aside address space for lab and staging use, and adding this
   address space to common filters to prevent destinations in this space
   from being routed in production networks (including the global
   Internet) improves security by preventing the leakage of prefixes
   used for testing into production environments.  As such, setting
   aside this space improves the overall security posture of the
   Internet.
