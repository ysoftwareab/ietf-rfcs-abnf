Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that allow
   monitoring of running instances of robust header compression.  The
   managed objects defined in this memo are grouped into three MIB
   modules.  The ROHC-MIB module defines managed objects shared by all
   ROHC profiles, the ROHC-UNCOMPRESSED-MIB module defines managed
   objects specific to the ROHC uncompressed profile, the ROHC-RTP-MIB
   module defines managed objects specific to the ROHC RTP profile, the
   ROHC UDP profile, and the ROHC ESP profile.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that allow
   monitoring of running instances of robust header compression.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and

Internet-Draft                  ROHC MIB                   November 2002


        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.


3.  Overview

   This section describes the basic model of RObust Header Compression
   (ROHC, [RFC3095]) used when developing the MIB modules for ROHC
   described in the following sections.

   ROHC presents a framework for IP header compression that allows
   flexible adjustment of compression efficiency versus robustness
   against channel errors depending on the underlying channel
   characteristics.

Internet-Draft                  ROHC MIB                   November 2002


   ROHC introduces header compressors/decompressors at the end-points
   (interfaces) of (wireless) channels on which packets with compressed
   headers are transferred.  ROHC exploits the temporal redundancy in
   successive packet headers of a packet flow by storing non-changing
   fields of the headers as well as reference values of predictably
   changing fields as context information.  When the context information
   for a packet flow is also established at the decompressor, only
   delta-information and unpredictably changing header fields have to be
   sent over the channel.

   This document specifies MIB modules in order to provide means for
   managing ROHC implementations via SNMP and within the IETF management
   framework.  The objects defined support configuration management,
   fault management and performance monitoring.

   For configuration management implementation parameters (Section 6.3.
   of RFC 3095) and configuration parameters (including the ones
   specified in 5.1.1 of RFC 3095) can be verified by using the ROHC
   MIB.

   For fault management compressor/decompressor state and mode can be
   checked and the compressor context can be reinitialized.

   For performance management a set of statistics is provided including
   the number of flows that have used ROHC, the current and long term
   compression ratio, the number of reinitializations and the number of
   packets sent or received with different header types.


4.  Structure of the MIB modules

   This section presents the structure of the MIB modules that are
   specified in Section 6.  Basically, the MIB is structured according
   to the ROHC architecture described in [ROHCARC].

   ROHC is an evolving technology.  RFC 3095 specifies the header
   compression framework and four profiles (uncompressed, RTP, UDP,
   ESP).  A profile for compression of TCP flows is under development
   within the ROHC working group and SCTP compression is being discussed
   as potential next candidate.  Therefore, the managed objects defined
   below are structured into three MIB modules: the general ROHC-MIB
   module and the profile-specific ROHC-UNCOMPRESSED-MIB and ROHC-RTP-
   MIB modules.

   The ROHC-MIB module defines properties of information on ROHC
   instances, ROHC channels, ROHC profiles, and ROHC compressor and
   decompressor contexts.  All managed objects in this module are
   assumed to be shared by all profiles.

   The ROHC-UNCOMPRESSED-MIB module extends the ROHC-MIB by managed

Internet-Draft                  ROHC MIB                   November 2002


   objects that are specific to the ROHC uncompressed profile (0x0000)
   defined in RFC 3095.  The ROHC-RTP-MIB module extends the ROHC-MIB by
   managed objects that are specific to the three other profiles defined
   in RFC 3095: ROHC RTP (profile 0x0001), ROHC UDP (profile 0x0002),
   and ROHC ESP (profile 0x0003).

   The number of managed objects in these two MIB modules is rather
   small.  They contain context state and context mode, and profile-
   specific context statistics.  It is assumed that MIB modules for
   future profiles will be similarly small and easy to design.

4.1.  The ROHC-MIB module

   The ROHC-MIB module defines managed objects that are expected to be
   useful for all current and future ROHC profiles. Objects in the ROHC-
   MIB module are arranged into four tables: the rohcInstanceTable, the
   rohcChannelTable, the rohcProfileTable, and the rohcContextTable.
   The managed objects in the first three groups are rather static
   (except for provided statistics), while the objects in the
   rohcContextTable are more dynamic.

   All tables are indexed by the IP interface number and by a numeric
   channel identifier.  The channel identifier is used for channels to
   which compressors and decompressors are attached (called ROHC
   channels in [ROHCARC]), as well as for dedicated feedback channels
   (called ROHC feedback channels in [ROHCARC]).  Compressor and
   decompressor instances are further indexed by their type (either
   compressor or decompressor). Contexts are indexed by the same index
   as their corresponding instance and their individual CID.

4.1.1.  rohcInstanceTable

   The rohcInstanceTable defines properties of ROHC compressor instances
   and ROHC decompressor instances.  The set of properties include

    o   the vendor of the implementation, version number and
        description,

    o   the channels used for compressed packets and for feedback,

    o   implementation and configuration properties including clock
        resolution, maximum context identifier number (MAX_CID), the
        LARGE_CIDS flag, and the Maximum Reconstructed Reception Unit
        (MRRU),

    o   the storagetime for contexts created by this instance,

    o   the status of the instance (operational or not).

   Optionally, the rohcInstanceTable also contains instance statistics


Quittek, Hartenstein, Stiemerling                               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  ROHC MIB                   November 2002


   including

    o   the total number of compressed flows,

    o   the current number of compressed flows,

    o   the total number of packets passing this instance, and

    o   the total compression ratio achieved on the channel.

   Instances are listed per IP interface.

4.1.2.  rohcChannelTable

   The rohcChannelTable lists all channels used by ROHC instances for
   transferring compressed packets and/or for giving feedback from the
   decompressor to the compressor.  Again the channels are listed per IP
   interface.

   rohcInstanceTable and rohcChannelTable share the same index.  For
   both, the channel identifier is used.  For all ROHC channels used by
   ROHC instances for transferring compressed packets, there is a
   corresponding entry in the instance table with the same index.  For
   dedicated feedback channels no such entry exists.  Anyway, by using
   the same index, it is always possible to directly identify and access
   the corresponding channel for an instance and to directly identify
   and access the corresponding instance from a ROHC channel.

   The information per channel in the rohcChannelTable includes

    o   the channel ID,

    o   the channel type, either 'notIn&Use', 'rohc', or
        'dedicatedFeedback',

    o   the channel for which feedback is provided by this channel,

    o   a string for describing the channel, and

    o   the status of the channel being either 'enabled' or 'disabled'.

4.1.3.  rohcProfileTable

   The rohcProfileTable lists available profiles per instance including
   information on

    o   the profile number,

    o   the vendor and version number, and



Quittek, Hartenstein, Stiemerling                               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  ROHC MIB                   November 2002


    o   a string describing the profile.

4.1.4.  rohcContextTable

   The rohcContextTable lists compressor contexts or decompressor
   contexts per instance and context identifier (CID).  Each row of this
   table represents a context.  If a new context is created, also a new
   row in this table is created.  After expiration or termination of a
   context, the row will continue to exist until the context's storage
   time expires or until the CID is re-used. Then the row will be
   deleted.

   For each context, the following attribute are listed:

    o   the type of context ('compressor' or 'decompressor'), also used
        as part of the table index,

    o   the CID,

    o   the state of the CID ('unused', 'active', 'expired', or

    o   the used profile,

    o   in case of a decompressor: the decompressor depth, and

    o   the storage time.

   Optionally, context statistics is provided including

    o   activation and deactivation time of the context,

    o   the number of packets sent or received, respectively,

    o   the numbers of IRs and IR-DYNs sent or received, respectively,

    o   the number of feedbacks sent or received, respectively,

    o   in case of a decompressor conrtext: the numbers of decompressor
        failures and repairs,

    o   the total compression ratio of all packets passing this context,

    o   the total compression ratio of all packet headers compressed in
        this context,

    o   the mean packets size of all packets passing this context,

    o   the mean header size of all compressed headers in this context,




Quittek, Hartenstein, Stiemerling                               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                  ROHC MIB                   November 2002


    o   the compression ratio of the last 16 packets passing this
        context,

    o   the compression ratio of the last 16 packet headers compressed
        in this context,

    o   the mean packets size of the last 16 packets passing this
        context,

    o   the mean header size of the last 16 compressed headers in this
        context.

4.2.  The ROHC-UNCOMPRESSED-MIB module

   The ROHC-UNCOMPRESSED-MIB module defines managed objects that are
   specific to ROHC uncompressed profile (0x0000) specified in RFC 3095.

4.2.1.  rohcUncmprContextTable

   The rohcUncmprContextTable extends the rohcContextTable. It provides
   information on state and mode of the compressor for profile 0x0000.
   Optionally, it also provides a counter of ACK feedbacks sent or
   received by the context, respectively.

4.3.  The ROHC-RTP-MIB module

   The ROHC-RTP-MIB module defines managed objects that are specific to
   three profiles specified in RFC 3095: ROHC RTP (profile 0x0001), ROHC
   UDP (profile 0x0002), and ROHC ESP (profile 0x0003).  The ROHC-RTP-
   MIB contains two tables, the rohcRtpContextTable and the
   rohcRtpPacketSizeTable.

4.3.1.  rohcRtpContextTable

   The rohcRtpContextTable extends the rohcContextTable. It provides
   information on context state and context mode for profiles 0x0001 -
   0x0003.  For compressor contexts it optionally contains managed
   object containing the numbers of allowed and used packet sizes.  As
   futher option, counters of the numbers of ACKs, NACKs, and SNACKs in
   this context are specified.

4.3.2.  rohcPacketSizeTable

   The optional rohcPacketSizeTable lists allowed packet sizes per
   compressor context.  Used packet sizes are marked.

6.  Security Considerations

   The managed objects defined by the ROHC-MIB module, the ROHC-
   UNCOMPRESSED_MIB module and the ROHC-RTP-MIB module are read-only
   except the storage time of context table rows.  Therefore,
   unauthorized users getting access to the MIB via SNMP cannot cause
   harm to existing ROHC connections nor can they manipulate running
   instances of ROHC in a malicious way.  The only change they might be
   able to cause is a shortened or extended storage time of row in the
   context table. This might result in loss of information about past
   contexts.

   Another security issue is mis-use of he MIB for getting information
   about existing communication sessions.  However, the only information
   that might be disclosed is the use of channels. Users and their
   addresses are not visible in the MIB.  This information can only be
   mis-used in conjunction with the mis-use of further information.

   Although, the security risks arising from the ROHC-MIB module are not
   considered to be high, it is recommended for implementors and
   operators to apply the means for security offered by SNMPv3,
   particularly encryption of communication and the User-based Security
   Model described in [RFC2574].
