                       draft-ietf-httpbis-auth-01

Abstract

   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-
   level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
   systems.  This document formerly defined the HTTP Authentication
   framework, which has since been moved to the core HTTP Semantics
   document.

1.  Introduction

   HTTP provides a general framework for access control and
   authentication, via an extensible set of challenge-response
   authentication schemes, which can be used by a server to challenge a
   client request and by a client to provide authentication information.

   The entire content of this document (previously in [RFC2617] and
   [RFC7235]) has been moved to [Semantics].
