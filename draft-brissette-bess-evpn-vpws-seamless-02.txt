            EVPN-VPWS Seamless Integration with Legacy VPWS
               draft-brissette-bess-evpn-vpws-seamless-02

Abstract

   This document specifies mechanisms for backward compatibility of
   Ethernet VPN Virtual Private Wire Service (EVPN-VPWS) solutions with
   legacy Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS).  It provides mechanisms
   for seamless integration in the same MPLS/IP network on a per-
   pseudowire or per flexible-crossconnect service basis.
   Implementation of this document enables service providers to
   introduce EVPN-VPWS PEs in their brown-field deployments of legacy
   VPWS networks.  This document specifies control-plane and forwarding
   behaviour needed for auto-discovery of a pseudowire in order to
   enable seamless integration between EVPN-VPWS and VPWS PEs.

1.  Introduction

   Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) is a widely-deployed Layer-2 VPN
   (L2VPN) technology.  Many service providers, who are looking at
   adopting Ethernet VPN Virtual Private Wire Service (EVPN-VPWS), want
   to preserve their investment in the VPWS networks.  Hence, they
   require mechanisms by which EVPN-VPWS can be introduced into their
   brown-field legacy VPWS networks without requiring any upgrades
   (software or hardware) to these networks.  This document specifies
   control-plane and forwarding behaviour needed for auto-discovery of a

   pseudowire in order to enable seamless integration between EVPN-VPWS
   Provider Edge(PE) devices and PEs running legacy VPWS services in the
   same MPLS/IP network.

                    Seamless Integration of EVPN-VPWS.

                                 Figure 1

   Figure 1 shows a simple network where PE1 runs in hybrid mode (EVPN-
   VPWS and legacy VPWS).  It provides a pseudowire (PW1) with PE2
   running legacy VPWS.  It also provides a pseudowire (PW2) with PE3
   running EVPN-VPWS.  PE2 may be upgraded to EVPN-VPWS seamlessly.
   Legacy PEs may be setting up PWs per [RFC8077] or may be setting up a
   VPWS service by first auto-discovering VPN members using [RFC6074]
   and then setting up the PWs using [RFC8077] or [RFC6624].

   The seamless integration solution described in this document has the
   following attributes:

   - It is backward compatible with [RFC8214] and EVPN Flexible
   crossconnect Service [evpn_fxc] document.

   - New PEs can leverage the multi-homing mechanisms and provisioning
   simplifications of EVPN Ethernet-Segment:

   a.  Auto-sensing of MHN / MHD

   b.  Auto-discovery of redundancy group

   c.  Auto-election of Designated Forwarder and VLAN carving

   d.  Support of various load-balancing mode such as port-active,
       single-active and all-active

   Figure 2 illustrates how legacy VPWS brown-field network migration to
   EVPN-VPWS is achieved.  For example, let say PE1 and PE2 have a

   legacy PW established between them.  First, network operator may
   upgrade PE2 to support EVPN-VPWS.  Once upgraded, PE2 which now have
   the EVPN-VPWS capability still runs legacy VPWS PW with PE1.  Later
   on, network operator may decide to upgrade PE1 to support EVPN-VPWS.
   As soon as the upgrade is completed, EVPN-VPWS service takes high-
   precedence over legacy VPWS network.  The network operator can safely
   remove any legacy configuration related to that PW from PE1 and PE2
   nodes.  PW remains established as an EVPN-VPWS service.

3.  Solution Requirements

   Following are the key requirements for backward compatibility between
   EVPN-VPWS and VPWS:

   o  The solution MUST allow for staged migration towards EVPN-VPWS on
      a site-by-site basis - e.g., new EVPN-VPWS sites to be provisioned
      on EVPN-VPWS Provider Edge devices (PEs).  Migration SHOULD be
      possible on a per-pseudowire basis.

   o  The solution MUST NOT require any changes to existing Legacy VPWS
      or PEs, unless it is to upgrade them to EVPN-VPWS.

   o  The solution MUST allow for the co-existence of PE devices running
      EVPN-VPWS and VPWS for the same single-homed and/or multi-homed
      segments.

   o  The solution MUST support port-active redundancy of multi-homed
      networks and multi-homed devices for EVPN-VPWS PEs.

   o  The solution MUST support single-active redundancy of multi-homed
      networks and multi-homed devices for EVPN-VPWS PEs.

   o  The solution SHOULD support all-active redundancy of multi-homed
      Ethernet Segments for EVPN-VPWS PEs.

   These requirements collectively allow for the seamless insertion of
   the EVPN-VPWS technology into brown-field VPWS deployments.

4.  Seamless Integration

   In order to support seamless integration with Legacy PEs, this
   document may require Legacy PEs to setup PWs per [RFC8077] or may
   require Legacy PEs to setup VPWS service by auto-discovering VPN
   members using [RFC6074] and then setting up the PWs using [RFC8077]
   or [RFC6624].  Furthermore, EVPN-VPWS PEs must support BGP EVPN
   routes per [RFC8214] and one of method of legacy VPWS technologies.
   All the logic for seamless integration SHALL reside on the EVPN-VPWS
   PEs.

5.  Capability Discovery

   The EVPN-VPWS PEs MUST advertise both BGP VPWS Auto-Discovery (VPWS
   A-D) route or LDP-LM message as well as the BGP EVPN Ethernet-AD per
   EVI route for a given pseudowire.

   In the case of VPWS PEs running VPWS A-D, they may advertise the BGP
   VPWS A-D route, per the procedures specified in [RFC4664] and
   [RFC6074].  The operator may decide to use the same BGP Route Target
   (RT) to identify a pseudowire on both EVPN-VPWS and VPWS networks.
   In this case, when a VPWS PE receives the EVPN Ethernet-AD per EVI
   route, it MUST ignore it on the basis that it belongs to an unknown
   SAFI.  However, the operator may choose to use two RTs - one to
   identify the pseudowire on VPWS network and another for EVPN-VPWS
   network and employ RT-constrained [RFC4684] in order to prevent BGP
   EVPN routes from reaching the VPWS PEs.

   When an EVPN-VPWS PE receives both a VPWS A-D route or a LDP-LM
   message as well as an EVPN-VPWS Ethernet-AD per EVI route from a
   given remote PE for the same pseudowire, it MUST give preference to
   the EVPN-VPWS route for the purpose of discovery.  This ensures that,
   at the end of the route exchange, all EVPN-VPWS capable PEs discover
   other EVPN-VPWS capable PEs.  Furthermore, all the VPWS-only PEs
   discover the EVPN-VPWS PEs as if they are standard VPWS PEs.  In
   other words, when the discovery phase is completed, the EVPN-VPWS PEs
   have discovered the remote PE per pseudowire along with their
   associated capability (EVPN-VPWS or VPWS-only), whereas the VPWS PE
   have discovered the remote PE per pseudowire as if it is VPWS-only
   PEs.

   Figure 3 demonstrates a typical brown-field deployment where PE2 is a
   legacy PE and PE1 is an EVPN-VPWS PE.

                                 Figure 3

   The forwarding state setup procedures over VPWS PEs are per
   [RFC8077], [RFC4761] and [RFC4762].

   The EVPN-VPWS PE procedures are as follow:

   o  The EVPN-VPWS PE MUST establish a PW to each remote PE from which
      it has received only a VPWS A-D route or a LDP-LM message for the
      corresponding pseudowire, and MUST set up the label stack
      corresponding to the PW FEC.

   o  If an EVPN-VPWS PE receives a VPWS A-D route or a LDP-LM message
      from a given PE, it sets up a Legacy VPWS PW to that PE.  If it
      then receives an EVPN Ethernet-AD per EVI route for that PW from
      the same PE, then the EVPN-VPWS PE may bring the Legacy PW
      operationally down and MUST forward traffic using the label
      information from the EVPN Ethernet-AD per EVI route.

   o  If an EVPN-VPWS PE receives an EVPN Ethernet-AD per EVI route
      followed by a VPWS A-D route or a LDP-LM message from the same PE,
      then the EVPN-VPWS PE will setup the EVPN-VPWS PW.  It may keep
      the Legacy VPWS PW operationally down and MUST forward traffic
      using the reachability information from that EVPN Ethernet-AD per
      EVI route.

   o  For VPWS PEs not using VPWS A-D or LDP signalling, the EVPN-VPWS
      PEs need to be provisioned manually with PWs to those remote VPWS
      PEs for each pseudowire.  In that case, if an EVPN-VPWS PE

      receives an EVPN Ethernet-AD per EVI route from a PE to which a PW
      exists, it may keep VPWS PW operationally down and MUST forward
      traffic using the reachability information from that EVPN
      Ethernet-AD per EVI route.

                     EVPN-VPWS Port-Active Redundancy

                                 Figure 4

6.1.1.  Operations with Port-Active MH PEs

   In Figure 4, PE1 and PE2 are configured in port-active load-balancing
   mode.  Both PEs are advertising EVPN Ethernet-AD per ES route with
   the single-active bit set as described in EVPN port-active document
   [evpn_pa].  In this example PE1 is DF elected for the shared Ethernet
   Segment identifier.

   o  Only PE1, as DF, advertises the VPWS A-D route or LDP-LM message
      towards remote PE3.

   o  PE1 advertises the EVPN Ethernet-AD per EVI route for PW1 towards
      remote PE3.  The P-bit in L2 Attributes Extended Community is set
      for PE1 as per [RFC8214].  The purpose is to have all required
      EVPN-VPWS routes on remote PE so during an upgrade from Legacy
      VPWS to EVPN-VPWS, those remote nodes are immediately upgraded.

   o  PE2, as NDF, only advertises its EVPN Ethernet AD per EVI route
      corresponding to that same PW1.  The B-bit in L2 Attributes
      Extended Community is set for PE2 as per [RFC8214]

   Upon link failure between CE1 and PE1, PE1 and PE2 follows EVPN
   Ethernet Segment DF Election procedures described in [RFC8214] for
   EVPN-VPWS.  Furthermore, PE1 withdraws its VPWS A-D route or sends
   LDP-LW message to remote PE3 to teardown the Legacy PW.  Finally, PE2
   advertises corresponding VPWS A-D route or LDP-LM message for that
   PW1 and re-establish Legacy PW with new PE2 destination.

   If PE3 is running 2-way pseudowire redundancy and PW-status is
   enabled, PE2 may leverage the existence of standby/backup PW with
   PE3.  In this particular scenario, PE2 may advertise VPWS A-D route
   or LDP-LM message along with PW-status message.

   Once PE3 is upgraded and supports EVPN-VPWS, seamless integration
   procedures are applied.  Higher precedence of EVPN-VPWS over VPWS
   allow all PEs to avoid the usage of legacy circuit.  At that point in
   time, non-preferred legacy VPWS protocols and configuration may be
   removed from all PEs.

6.1.2.  Operation with Single-Active MH PEs

   Single-active operation is similar to Port-active load-balancing mode
   described above but at the VLAN level instead being of at the port/
   interface level.

   The main difference resides on the support of Legacy PW VC-type 4 vs
   PW VC-Type 5 mode on the EVPN-VPWS PE as per [RFC4448].  While
   services running in port-active load-balancing mode require raw mode,
   services running single-active load-balancing mode use tagged mode.

6.1.3.  Operation with All-Active MH PEs

   In EVPN-VPWS all-active load-balancing mode, all PEs participating in
   a redundancy group forward traffic bidirectionally, reducing the
   importance of DF and NDF PE.  However PEs running Legacy VPWS do NOT
   support all-active peering PEs as remote endpoint.

6.1.3.1.  Falling back to port-active

   EVPN-VPWS PE discovering remote PE running VPWS PW MAY fallback into
   port-active load-balancing mode.  In that case, following rules are
   applied:

   o  Peering PEs advertise EVPN Ethernet-AD per ES route with the
      single-active bit set.  They also advertise EVPN Ethernet-AD per

      EVI route towards PE3 with P/B bit set accordingly as per
      [RFC8214].

   o  DF PE advertises VPWS AD routes or LDP-LM message and EVPN
      Ethernet AD per EVI route per PW.

   o  NDF PE advertises only EVPN Ethernet AD per EVI route per PW.

   o  If PE3 is running 2-ways pseudowire redundancy, PE2 may leverage
      the existence of standby/backup PW with PE3.  PE2 may advertise
      VPWS AD route or LDP-LM message with proper PW-status message.

6.1.3.2.  Asymmetric forwarding

   One privilege option is the asymmetric forwarding while peering PEs
   run in all-active load-balancing mode.  In the example of Figure 3,
   traffic from CE1 going to PE1 is forwarded to PE3 using the VPN label
   learned from VPWS AD route or LDP-LM message received from PE3.
   Traffic from CE1 going to PE2 should get forwarded to PE3 using that
   same VPN label.  Traffic coming from CE3 to PE3 gets forwarded only
   over the primary PW towards PE1; the DF PE.

   Supporting asymmetric forwarding with purely LDP as per [RFC8077]
   requires extensions to EVPN-VPWS MH procedures.  These procedures are
   NOT restricted only to LDP and may be applied to VPWS A-D.

   Following rules are applied to achieve expected behaviour:

   o  Peering PEs advertise EVPN Ethernet-AD per ES route with the
      single-active bit unset.  That is to get the network ready when
      remote legacy PE are upgraded to EVPN-VPWS.

   o  DF PE advertises VPWS AD routes or LDP-LM message and EVPN
      Ethernet AD per EVI route per PW.

   o  NDF PE advertises only EVPN Ethernet AD per EVI route per PW.

   o  If PE3 is running 2-ways pseudowire redundancy, PE2 may leverage
      the existence of standby/backup PW with PE3.  PE2 may advertise
      VPWS AD route or LDP-LM message with proper PW-status message.

   o  The tunnel encapsulation attribute [tun_encap] is used to
      synchronize alias PW label between peering PEs.  The tunnel
      encapsulation attribute, specifying the alias PW label and tunnel
      endpoint (nexthop) of the remote PE (PE3), is transmitted along
      with EVPN Ethernet-AD per EVI route.  The NDF PEs uses the same
      VPN label per Legacy PW as DF PE when transmitting traffic coming
      from CE (CE1) towards remote PE(PE3).
