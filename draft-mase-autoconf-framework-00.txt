   stand-alone ad hoc networks (MANETs).  Specifically, we consider two
   cases.  First, a node without a pre-assigned and valid MANET-local
   address acquires a new MANET-local address and becomes a member of a
   new or existing MANET.  Second, two or more MANETs merge.  In the
   first case, a mechanism of IP address generation based on a stateful
   or stateless method is needed.  We also should have MANET-wide
   duplicate address detection (MANET-DAD) on newly generated address
   (tentative address) for suppressing occurrence of duplicate addresses
   regardless of whether stateful or stateless method is employed for
   address generation (pre-service MANET-DAD).  In the second case,
   duplicate address may occur as the result of a merger of two formerly
   independent networks.  We should have MANET-DAD on addresses in use
   for resolving duplicate addresses and suppressing routing information
   contamination due to existence of duplicate addresses (in-service
   MANET-DAD).  To realize pre-service MANET-DAD and in-service MANET-
   DAD, we define autoconfiguration states for both proactive and
   reactive routing protocol.  Each node exists in one of the
   autoconfiguration states at any time.  The specific MANET-DAD
   algorithm is beyond the scope of this document.

1.  Introduction

   This document discusses autoconfiguration of unique local (MANET-
   local) address for stand-alone MANET.  Autoconfiguration methods are
   generally classified into stateless and stateful methods.
   Conventional statefull and stateless autoconfiguration methods cannot
   be used for stand-alone mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), since such
   networks do not depend on a central server and multihop communication
   is involved.  A number of autoconfiguration solutions to prevent
   address conflict have been proposed for stand-alone MANETs
   [1],[6]-[21].  Some of these proposals discuss MANET-wide duplicated
   address detection (MANET-DAD) only in initial address generation and
   do not discuss potential occurrence of address conflict when network
   mergers occur.  Some of these proposals discuss MANET-DAD to deal
   with address conflict in case of a merger.  The aim of this document
   is not to provide another solution for the MANET autoconfiguration
   problem, but to give a common framework, that may be useful for
   designing solutions regardless of wether the underlying routing
   protocol is proactive or reactive.  The baselines of this framework
   are as follows:

      - Each node should perform MANET-DAD both before and after
      assignment of a valid address in a MANET.  This is termed "pre-
      service MANET-DAD" and "in-service MANET-DAD" respectively.

      - MANET-DAD functions should be embedded in routing control
      messages regardless of pre-service MANET-DAD or in-service MANET-
      DAD.

   With regard to the first baseline above, pre-service MANET-DAD is
   useful to suppress occurrences of an address conflict regardless of
   whether stateless or stateful address assignment methods are employed
   and in-service MANET-DAD is useful to suppress occurrences of address
   conflict in case of network mergers.  To realize pre-service and in-
   service MANET-DAD systematically, we use the concept of
   autoconfiguration states.  This was first proposed in [6] and is
   extended in this document.  The second baseline is useful to reduce
   pre-service MANET-DAD and in-service MANET-DAD overhead, even when
   nodes in pre-service MANET-DAD state and those in in-service MANET-
   DAD state coexist.  A pioneering example of pre-service MANET-DAD for
   a reactive routing MANET was proposed in [7].  A pioneering example
   of in-service MANET-DAD for both proactive and reactive routing
   protocols was proposed in [1].  These useful but individual schemes
   can be systematically included as the elements in the proposed
   framework.  A functionality and mechanism of "Duplicate address
   detection(DAD)" for link-local address are defined in the traditional
   IETF terms-RFC(2461/2462) [3] and [4].  The mechanisms defined in
   this document, i.e., "pre-service MANET-DAD" is identical in

   functionality (but not mechanism) to DAD, and "in-service MANET-DAD"
   is a fundamentally new-to IETF functionality, necessary for MANETs.

2.  Terminology [2],[3]

2.1.  General

   This section provides definitions for terms that have a specific
   meaning to the protocol specified in this document and that are used
   throughout the text.  Some fundamental definitions are taken from
   [3], [4].

   IP - Internet Protocol Version 4 or 6.

   node - a device that implements IP.

   link - a communication facility or medium over which nodes can
      communicate at the link layer, i.e., the layer immediately below
      IP.

   interface - a node's attachment to a link.

   neighbors - nodes attached to the same link.

   address - an IP-layer identifier for an interface.

   MANET-local address - a unique-local address having scope that is
      limited to the MANET.

   Tentative address - an address whose uniqueness in a MANET is being
      verified, prior to its assignment to an interface.  A tentative
      address is not considered assigned to an interface in the usual
      sense.  An interface discards received packets addressed to a
      tentative address, but accepts Routing Control packets related to
      MANET-wide Duplicate Address Detection for the tentative address.

   Address Generation - Adress generation is a procedure for a node,
      that has currently no address, to obtain a tentative address in
      the MANET -either of its own accord or with support of other
      nodes.

   Address Conflict - When two nodes in the same MANET network share the
      same address or tentative address, the situation is described as
      an "Address Conflict".  The nodes involved are "conflicting nodes"
      and their shared address is called the "conflicting address".
      Conflicting nodes may each send a message with the identical
      sequence number and message type: such messages are denoted
      "conflicting messages".

   MANET-wide Duplicate Address Detection (MANET-DAD) - MAENT-wide
      Duplicate address detection is the action of detecting address
      conflict in the MANET, the situation where some nodes are going to
      use or using the same address in the same MANET network.

   Pre-Service MANET-DAD - Pre-service MANET-DAD is the procedure to
      verify that a tentative address is out of address conflict with
      other MANET nodes.

   In-Service MANET-DAD - In-service MANET-DAD is the procedure to
      continuously verify a used address is out of address conflict with
      other MANET nodes.

   Autoconfiguration State - The current autoconfiguration state of the
      node, one of NO_ADDRESS, INQUIRY, and NORMAL for reactive routing
      protocols and one of HELLO, TOPOLOGY, and NORMAL for proactive
      routing protocols, which indicates what messages it should (or
      should not) generate and what processing it should (or should not)
      do.

   Familiar Address (Node) - An address is familiar to a node, if the
      node has seen it in control messages for a sufficiently long
      period of time.  A node recognizes the other node with a familiar
      address as the familiar node.  An address or a node which is not
      familiar is denoted "unfamiliar".

   Routing Table Contamination Avoidance - Routing table contamination
      avoidance is the idea of preserving the routing table from
      incorrect information due to address conflicts.  This is achieved
      by using the autoconfiguration states.

   Sequence Number Consistency - All control messages have a sequence
      number.  One trademark of duplicate addresses is sequence numbers
      of different messages, which could not result from a correct
      implementation of the routing protocol (such as decrease in
      sequence numbers, etc.).  The properties of sequence numbers,
      which would result from the normal routing protocol
      implementation, are termed "Sequence number consistency".

2.2.  Requirements

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [2].

3.  Overview

   We consider the MANET-local address autoconfiguration problem for
   stand-alone MANETs.  Specifically, we consider two cases.

      - In the first case, a node without a pre-assigned address
      acquires an address and becomes a member of a new or existing
      MANET.

      - In the second case, two or more MANETs merge.

   For the first case, a mechanism of address generation is needed, and
   a number of address generation methods have been proposed in
   literature.  These are classified into stateful and stateless
   methods.  In this case, a node first obtains an address (tentative
   address) using a proper address generation method, - be that either a
   stateful or stateless method.  It then verifies that the tentative
   address is not part of an address conflict with (not currently used
   by) other nodes.  This procedure is termed "pre-service MANET-DAD" in
   this document.  We SHOULD have pre-service MANET-DAD on a tentative
   address for suppressing occurrence of duplicate addresses in the
   address assignment regardless of whether stateful or stateless
   methods is employed.  Note that the necessity of pre-service MANET-
   DAD for MANETs with reactive routing protocol has been well known
   [7], while that for MANETs with proactive routing protocol was
   identified only recently [6].

   In the second case, duplicate address may occur as a result of two
   already configured networks merging.  To cope with this situation, a
   node in an existing MANET SHOULD continuously verify possible address
   conflict with other MANET nodes.  This procedure is termed "in-
   service MANET-DAD" in this document.  "Weak DAD" [13] and "passive
   DAD" [1] are examples of in-service MANET-DAD.  When an address
   conflict is detected, a node with a duplicate address MUST obtain a
   new address to resolve the address conflict.  This is accomplished
   using the address generation mentioned before.  During duplicate
   address detection and resolution in the above case, some nodes may
   share the same address transiently and, therefore, routing
   information may not be correctly maintained.  Specifically, a route
   entry may erroneously be updated based on control messages including
   information from different nodes with the same duplicate address.  We
   call this problem "routing information contamination".  We SHOULD
   have in-service MANET-DAD for detecting duplicate addresses as well
   as for suppressing routing contamination due to existence of
   duplicate addresses.  To systematically realize pre-service MANET-DAD
   and in-service MANET-DAD, we define autoconfiguration states for both
   proactive and reactive routing protocols.  Each node is in one of the
   autoconfiguration states at any time.  The proposed framework covers

   both proactive and reactive routing protocols.  Specific pre-service
   and in-service MANET-DAD algorithms are beyond the scope of this
   document.

4.  Autoconfiguration states

   A set of autoconfiguration states are defined, for both reactive and
   proactive routing protocols in order to realize pre-service MANET-DAD
   and in-service MANET-DAD.  Each node has an "autoconfiguration
   state".  This state is an indicator of how long the node has been in
   the network.  The central idea is that each time a node generates a
   new address, it should enter the network gradually, i.e. be in a pre-
   service autoconfiguration state and running a restrained version of
   the routing protocol.  This way, the node can detect which addresses
   are being used, checking for duplicates of its own address, while
   avoiding disrupting the routing tables of the other nodes in the
   MANET in the event that its address is actually found to be in
   conflict.

4.1.  Autoconfiguration states for reactive routing protocol

   There are exactly 3 autoconfiguration states for reactive routing
   protocols, which define the behavior of the node as follows:

   NO_ADDRESS_STATE : In this state a node does not have its own
      address, and it MUST NOT process and forward RREQ and RREP
      messages generated by other nodes.  It MUST NOT participate in
      data forwarding.  It MAY generate a tentative address by means of
      a pre-determined address generation method.  When it generates its
      tentative address, it enters the INQUIRY_STATE.

   INQUIRY_STATE - In this state, a node MUST NOT process and forward
      RREQ and RREP messages generated by other nodes.  It MUST NOT
      participate in data forwarding.  It SHOULD perform pre-service
      MANET-DAD using the same control messages such as route request
      (RREQ) and route reply (RREP) messages defined for the reactive
      routing protocol in the MANET.  Specific pre-service MANET-DAD
      methods for reactive routing protocols are beyond the scope of
      this document.  One of these methods is termed as "Strong DAD" in
      the literature, e.g. [13],[14].  To distinguish between normal
      control messages and those of autoconfiguration, a flag in the
      control message MAY be used to represent autoconfiguration state.
      For example, 0/1 in a RREQ indicates that the originating node is
      in NORMAL_STATE /INQUIRY_STATE, respectively.  When the node
      detects that it has an address conflict with other nodes, it MUST
      re-enter NO_ADDRESS_STATE.  When a pre-determined time has elapsed
      in INQUIRY_STATE without an address conflict being detected, the
      node enters the NORMAL_STATE.

Internet-Draft                  Framework                   October 2005


   NORMAL_STATE : In this state, the node is running the "normal"
      reactive routing protocol without message processing/generation
      restrictions associated to the state.  More precisely, the node
      generates both RREQ messages and RREP messages as usual.  It
      processes RREQ and RREP messages generated by other nodes and
      forwards these as specified by the routing protocol.  It also
      participates in data forwarding.  Only nodes in NORMAL_STATE are
      selected as the intermediary nodes (forwarders) during route
      discovery and route maintenance.  A node in this state SHOULD
      perform in-service MANET-DAD using the same control messages, such
      as route request (RREQ) and route reply (RREP) messages, as are
      defined for the reactive routing protocol in the MANET.  Specific
      in-service MANET-DAD method for reactive routing protocols is
      beyond the scope of this document.  When the node detects that it
      has an address conflict with other nodes, it MUST return the
      NO_ADDRESS_STATE.

   The behavior in each state is summarized in Table I and the state
   transition diagram is given in Fig.1

4.2.  Autoconfiguration states for proactive routing protocol

   In the following descriptions we assume OLSR as an example of the
   proactive routing protocols.  We point out that this is without loss
   of generality of the proposed framework.  There are exactly 4
   autoconfiguration states, in each of which the behavior of the node
   is:

   NO_ADDRESS_STATE : In this state a node does not have its own
      address, and it MUST NOT process and forward HELLO and TC
      (Topology Control) messages generated by other nodes.  It MUST NOT
      participate in data forwarding.  It generate a tentative address
      by means of a pre-determined address generation method.  When it
      generate a tentative address, it enters the HELLO_STATE.

   HELLO_STATE : In this state, a node generates HELLO messages, but not
      TC messages.  It MUST NOT participate in MPR selection nor MPR
      flooding, and MUST NOT participate in data packet forwarding
      either.  It doesn't populate the topology set nor the routing
      table.  It SHOULD perform pre-service MANET-DAD using the same
      HELLO messages defined for the proactive routing protocol in the
      MANET.  When it detects that it has an address conflict with other
      nodes, it MUST re-enter NO_ADDRESS_STATE.  When a pre-determined
      time has elapsed in HELLO_STATE without detecting address
      conflict, the node enters the TOPOLOGY_STATE.

   TOPOLOGY_STATE : In this state, a node generates HELLO messages, but
      not TC messages.  It processes TC messages, and performs MPR
      selection, but MUST NOT be MPR itself (i.e. in OLSR-willingness
      will-never) and hence, MUST NOT forward TC messages.  It populates
      its topology set but not its routing table, and MUST NOT
      participate in data packet forwarding.  It performs pre-service
      MANET-DAD using the same HELLO and TC messages defined for the
      proactive routing protocol in the MANET.  When the node detects
      that it has an address conflict with another node, it MUST re-
      enter NO_ADDRESS_STATE.  When a pre-determined time elapses in
      TOPOLOGY_STATE without detecting address conflict, node enters the
      NORMAL_STATE.

   NORMAL_STATE : In this state, the node is running the "normal" OLSR
      protocol without message processing/generation restrictions
      associated to the state.  More precisely, the node generates both
      HELLO messages and TC messages as specified by the routing
      protocol specification.  It processes TC messages generated by
      other nodes and forwards these as usual based on MPR flooding.
      The node populates its topology set, calculates routing tables and
      participates in data forwarding.  Only nodes in the NORMAL_STATE
      are selected as intermediary nodes (forwarders) in the routing

      table calculation.  A node in this state SHOULD perform pre-
      service MANET-DAD using the same HELLO and TC messages defined for
      the proactive routing protocol in the MANET.  When a node detects
      that it has an address conflict with another node, it MUST re-
      enter NO_ADDRESS_STATE.

   The behavior in each state is summarized in Table II and the state
   transition diagram is given in Fig.2.

5.  Effect of autoconfiguration states

   Pre-service MANET-DAD is performed when a node is in the
   INQUIRY_STATE in case of reactive routing protocols and in the
   HELLO_STATE or TOPOLOGY_STATE in case of proactive routing protocols.
   Pre-service MANET-DAD is effective at reducing potential address
   conflicts and the resulting routing table contamination when a new
   node joins a MANET.  These states are, however, not only effective
   for enabling pre-service MANET-DAD.  When a node is in one of these
   states, other nodes in the MANET have a chance to learn information
   about the node, such as address and sequence number.  Specifically,
   we assume that each node continuously collects information about
   other nodes, regardless of their states.  As a result, each node is
   "familiar" with other nodes in NORMAL_STATE within the connected
   MANET.  When network merger occurs, a node may find unfamiliar nodes,
   allowing it to detect the network merger.  Thus, network merger of
   multiple different MANETs can be detected without a sophisticated
   network merger detection method such as based on network ID as
   proposed in the literature [9].  This learning mechanism may be
   useful for easing the design of an in-service MANET-DAD algorithm.
   Specific in-service MANET-DAD algorithms are beyond the scope of this
   document.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document presents only framwork of autoconfiguration for stand-
   alone MANETs and does therefore not specify any special security
   measure.  However, introduction of autoconfiguration states may be
   useful to realize some security measures.  For example, node
   authentification may be done during the INQUIRY_STATE in a MANET with
   reactive routing protocols and during the HELLO_STATE and
   TOPOLOGY_STATE in a MANET with proactive routing protocols.
