    Abstract 

       The problem of path validation of a pure light-path in a Dense 
       Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) optical network 
       requires the transmission of optical impairments related 
       parameters along the provisioned route. In this draft we 
       propose an RSVP-TE based mechanism to collect and evaluate 
       optical impairments measured over optical nodes along the 
       light-path.

1. Introduction

       For enhanced path status validation, we need mechanisms that 
       can collect all physical impairments (consisting of optical 
       measurements such as signal power, OSNR, etc.) that affect the 
       light-path. The description of impairments type and effects 
       [G.680] is out of the scope of this draft, we follow the 
       description provided in [Bernstein-framework][Martinelli-frame]. 
       In this document we propose an RSVP-TE based mechanism for 
       collection of impairments along a light-path. The proposed 
       technique is also suitable for optical networks that suffer of 
       physical dysfunction due the non-ideal optical transmission 
       medium and/or to critical situations (e.g., a fiber cut). In 
       this scenario even if every node along the path is connected, 
       the reachability of the end node with an acceptable signal 
       quality is not guaranteed. In [RFC4054], an overview of some 
       critical optical impairment and their routing related issues 
       can be found. 
       The term impairments refer to real optical measurements or 
       estimates computed using a prediction model. The former may 
       require mutually exclusive access to hardware to avoid 
       interference, in which case the impairments required a  
       blocking collection type. In the later case the impairments are 
       collected with a non-blocking collection type. This draft 
       addresses impairments collection for both blocking and non-
       blocking type leaving the definition of the collection type to 
       as a section attribute.  
        
2. Impairments Collection 

       The line path validation mechanism needs to be aware of all 
       physical impairments (consisting of optical measurements such 
       as signal power, OSNR, Optical Channel Monitor, etc.) that 
       affect the light-path. Consequently this draft proposes control 
       plane based mechanism for impairments collection. How 
       impairments are collected (from data plane) is beyond the scope 
       of this document.  

     2.1. Optical Path Validation 

       Our approach is in full agreement with information model 
       [Bernstein-info] for path validation and in particular we refer 
       to [Bernstein-framework] for architectural options in which 
       impairment validation for an optical path is defined.  

       The validation of an optical path is assessed by collecting the 
       physical impairments along an LSP and evaluating them. In this 
        
        
       Z. Ali, et al            Expires May 3, 2009         [Page 3] 
           
        draft-ali-ccamp-rsvp-te-based-evidence-collection-01   Nov. 08 
        
       draft we make use of the LSP_ATTRIBUTES to perform the 
       impairments collection hop by hop along the optical path. 

       It is important to note that collection of impairments in a 
       blocking way requires a mutually exclusive access to the 
       resource. Therefore the entire LSP needs to be "locked" until 
       the collection for the impairments is completed. This implies 
       that if another impairments collection process tries to 
       retrieve impairments on the same node-resource already under 
       "Administrative Impairments Locking" status, needs to be 
       aborted. The draft uses the RSVP Admin status object to realize 
       "LSP Administrative Impairments locking" to make sure that all 
       nodes are ready to collect the impairments in a blocking way.  

       Our RSVP based impairments collection protocol made the optical 
       path validation described in [Berstain info] available.  

       More in details the G.680 gives techniques and formulas for use 
       in calculating the impact of a cascade of network elements. 
       These formulations is at the base of our path validation.  

        

       In the following we first define Optical Impairments collection 
       classification, and the extensions to LSP ATTRIBUTE and RSVP 
       Admin status objects needed to perform the aforementioned 
       functionalities. Section 2.7 details the signaling mechanism 
       with examples to illustrate how proposed extensions are used 
       for impairments collection. 

     2.2. Optical Impairments collection Classification and LSP Locking 

       Physical impairments that have effect on the light-path can be 
       collected in two ways: 

       o  Blocking impairments collection. In general in the case of 
       blocking collection, the impairment collection may require a 
       mutually exclusive access to hardware resources while 
       performing the measurement. 

       o  Non blocking impairments collection. A collection of 
       physical value that can be probed in parallel at different 
       nodes. 

       Consequently, every optical node can be in three states w.r.t. 
       to a certain reserved resource: unlock, lock-requested or lock. 
       In fact blocking collection of impairment requires the resource 

        
        
       Z. Ali, et al            Expires May 3, 2009         [Page 4] 
           
        draft-ali-ccamp-rsvp-te-based-evidence-collection-01   Nov. 08 
        
       to be in lock state. In general this is due to the hardware 
       limitation of optical nodes.   

       In case of blocking collection of impairments the LSP status 
       needs to be set to "Locked". For this purpose, we extend the 
       Admin object [RFC3471], [RFC3473] with B bit (Blocked request 
       bit) and C bit (block Confirm bit). Specifically, 
       Administrative status object is extended with the following two 
       bits for locking purpose. 
        
        0                   1                   2                   3

       Reflect (R): 1 bit 
       When set, indicates that the edge node SHOULD reflect the 
       object/TLV back in the appropriate message.  This bit MUST NOT 
       be set in state change request, i.e., Notify, messages. 
        
       Reserved: 25 bits. This field is reserved.  It MUST be set to 
       zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.  These 
       bits SHOULD be passed through unmodified by transit nodes. 
        
       Testing (T): 1 bit. When set, indicates that the local actions 
       related to the "testing" mode should be taken.

       local actions related to the "administratively down" state 
       should be taken. 
        
       Deletion in progress (D): 1 bit. When set, indicates that that 
       the local actions related to LSP teardown should be taken.  
       Edge nodes may use this flag to control connection teardown. 
        
       Blocking node (B): 1 bit. When set, indicates that locking 
       procedure is ongoing. 
        
       Confirm blocking (C): 1 bit. When set, indicates that the 
       locking procedure is successfully ongoing.

       During LSP locking for collection of impairments, the R bit 
       (Reflect bit) MUST be set. Furthermore, if the node along the 
       path understands B and C bits, the node MUST return the Admin 
       object in the Resv Message for locking confirmation or 
       unlocking. Since we need to block an entire LSP, any node 
       unable to measure the required impairments MUST set a lock 
       failure (unset the C bit in the Path Admin Object).  

       The general locking procedure is defined as follows: 

       o  Every transit node that receives the Admin status object in 
       the Path message with B, C and R bit set needs to check if the 
       actual status is unlock. 

       o  In the case of unlock status, the node switches to lock-
       required state related to the required impairments. 

       o  In the case of lock or lock-required states, the node 
       forwards the Admin object message without the C bit set. This 
       implies a lock failure.  

       o  The Resv message performs the locking for the entire LSP in 
       case of C and B bit set and unlocking in case of unset C bit. 

       o  Every transit node that receives the Resv message with B and 
       C bit set changes its status to lock.  

       This strategy prevents race conditions.  

     2.3. Optical Impairments Collection  

       Path validation is based on holistic analysis of the 
       impairments collected along the path of an LSP. To signal which 
       impairments needs to be collected we extend the LSP Attribute 
       TLV sub-object. 

       The impairments collection is performed as follows:  

       o  Source node sends a Path message with LSP Attribute object 
       aimed to inform the transit nodes about the imminent 
       impairments collection. The Path message also contains TLV sub-
       objects with required impairments.  

       o  Every transit node, when receives the message with LSP 
       Attribute object, assembles the collected impairments 
       (specified in TLV) inside a sub-TLV. The way an optical node 
       gets knowledge of the impairments using information locally 
        
        
       Z. Ali, et al            Expires May 3, 2009         [Page 6] 
           
        draft-ali-ccamp-rsvp-te-based-evidence-collection-01   Nov. 08 
        
       available at the node (e.g. via discovery of internal 
       amplifiers, photodiode etc.) is out of the scope of this 
       document.  

       o  Impairments collection will be executed by the returning 
       Resv message that collects hop-by-hop impairments objects by 
       inserting the sub-TLV inside the attached TLV. After successful 
       forwarding of the Resv message the status of transit nodes MUST 
       be switched to unlock for preventing deadlock. 

       In case of blocking collection of impairments the LSP lock MUST 
       be obtained before impairments collection. 

       In case of non-blocking collection type, the unavailability of 
       certain impairments in an intermediate node MUST NOT cause the 
       request of failure. The holistic impairments evaluation SHOULD 
       be able to deal with missing impairments. 

       When a transit node not in locked state receives a request for 
       blocking collection type, an impairments collection failure 
       (PathErr) SHOULD be sent to the Ingress node.  

     2.4. Impairments Collection Request TLV 

       The proposed encoding scheme for optical impairments 
       measurements defines a TLV associated to a particular 
       impairments type. A TLV sub-object is encoded in an 
       LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Object [RFC4420]. The TLV sub-object 
       encoding is: 

           0                   1                   2

       Length: length of the TLV object in bytes without the 4 byte 
       header. 

       E-type (Impairments Type, 8 bits): Impairments identifier 
       encoded as per [WD6-23]. E.g., 0 for Signal power, 1 for OSNR, 
       2 for Pilot Tone (as blocking impairments).  

       This TLV defines which types of impairments (signal power, 
       OSNR, Pilot Tone, alarm etc.) need to be collected and is 
       carried by the Path message. 

     2.5. Impairments recording TLV 

       A set of impairments is collected through the Resv message to 
       allow the evaluation at the ingress node. Each item of optical 
       impairments is collected separately. Every transit node, in the 
       Path message, finds the impairments Collection Requested TLV 
       and replies the impairments value in Resv using impairments 
       recording TLV (encoded in an LSP_ATTRIBUTES Object). The 
       impairments value can be measured or estimated. Furthermore it 
       sets the Measure Method inside this TLV according to the kind 
       of measured media (single lambda measurement or aggregate 
       measurement).  
        
       This impairments collection improves the feasibility evaluation 
       where network elements support at least a subset of 
       impairments. 
        
       The following TLV encodes the impairments values of the LSP 
       associated to the impairments type defined in the impairments 
       Collection Request TLV.

       a GMPLS LSP that has OXC1 as Ingress Node, OXC4 as Egress node 
       with OXC2 and OXC3 in transit, as shown below.  

        
                +------+       +------+       +------+       +------+

       In the following we consider three scenarios of impairments 
       collection and describe signaling procedures associated with 
       the impairments collection and how above mentioned extensions 
       to LSP Attribute and admin status objects are used for this 
       purpose.  

     2.6.1. Non-blocking collection of impairments 

       The validation of an optical path is done after LSP is 
       signaled. In case of non-blocking collection, the impairments 
       collection follows the following procedure: 

       o  OXC1 node sends a Path message with Impairments Collection 
       Request TLV aimed to inform the transit nodes about the 
       imminent impairments collection and about the type of 
       impairments that needs to be collected (e.g., Signal power).      

       o  Every transit node (OXC2,OXC3), when receives the Path 
       message with Impairments Collection Request TLV, starts the 
       internal impairments reading procedure and waits for the 
       correspondent Resv message to forward the related Impairments 
       recording TLV in the upstream flow to the ingress node OXC1. If 
       for some reason the impairment is not available, since it is 
       non blocking impairment, the node simply does not include the 
       impairments measure in its own Impairments recording TLV. The 
       holistic analysis can be performed also with a subset of the 
       non blocking impairments.  

       o Egress node OXC4 sends Resv message with Impairments 
       Collection Request TLV containing optical impairments TLV 
       upstream to the ingress node OXC1 and puts its own impairments 
       value in this Impairments recording TLV. 

       o  Every transit node (OXC3,OXC2) inserts its own Impairments 
       recording TLV inside Resv message in such way that ingress node 
       collects all required impairments hop by hop.  
        
        
       Z. Ali, et al            Expires May 3, 2009        [Page 10] 
           
        draft-ali-ccamp-rsvp-te-based-evidence-collection-01   Nov. 08 
        
       o  OXC1 node when receives the Resv message extract the 
       impairments recording TLV to perform holistic path validation.  

       The transit nodes that do not support LSP_REQUIRED ATTRIBUTE 
       object or do not support impairments request TLV will be 
       addressed in a later version of the document. 

       Summarizing the Impairments Collection will be executed by the 
       returning Resv message that collects hop-by-hop impairments 
       objects upstream. 

     2.6.2. Blocking collection of impairments with all nodes ready for 
       impairments collection 

       In this scenario the locking strategy needs to be performed 
       first to ensure that no node in the LSP is already locked in 
       another blocking collection. I.e., we need to be sure that all 
       nodes along the path are ready to collect the impairments. This 
       phase uses Admin status object in the Path and Resv message, as 
       follows: 

       o  OXC1 switches to "lock-required" state and sends a Path 
       message with Admin status object with B, C and R bit set. B bit 
       is used to signal locking is required. C bit is used for 
       locking confirmation. Recall it needs to be set if lock is 
       granted, and needs to be unset otherwise.  

       o  Every transit node (OXC2, OXC3) that receives the Admin 
       status object in the Path message with B, C and R bit set 
       switches to "lock-required" state related to the required 
       impairments. 

       o  Egress node OXC4 switches to lock state and forwards the 
       Admin status object in the Resv message, resetting the R bit. 

       o  Every transit node (OXC3,OXC2) that receives the Resv 
       message with B and C bit set changes its state to "locked".  

       o  Ingress node OXC1 when receives the Resv message with Admin 
       status object with B and C bit set switches to "locked" state. 

       At the end of this procedure the entire LSP is in "locked" 
       state and is ready for impairments collection.  

       At this stage the Impairments Collection can be performed as 
       described earlier.  


        
        
       Z. Ali, et al            Expires May 3, 2009        [Page 11] 
           
        draft-ali-ccamp-rsvp-te-based-evidence-collection-01   Nov. 08 
        
       The locking is performed before impairments collection to 
       maintain a better compatibility with the future available 
       impairments kind that would require further action to be taken 
       before starting the collection. 

     2.6.3.  Blocking collection of impairments with some node(s) 
       blocked for impairments collection. 

       In this scenario the locking procedure fails since some node 
       (OXC3 in this example) is in "locked" or "lock-required" state 
       over another LSP. 

       o  OXC1 switches to lock-required state and sends a Path 
       message with Admin status object with B, C and R bit set. B bit 
       is used to signal locking is required. C bit is used for 
       locking confirmation. Recall it needs to be set if lock is 
       granted, and needs to be unset otherwise.   

       o  OXC2 receives the Admin status object in the Path message 
       with B, C and R bit set and switches to "lock-required" state 
       related to the required impairments. 

       o  OXC3 node receives the Admin status object and, since it is 
       already in lock or lock-required state for another LSP with the 
       same resources, unsets the C bit. Therefore the locking 
       procedure will fail. 

       o  Egress node OXC4, since the received Admin object does not 
       have the C bit set, switches to unlock state and forwards the 
       received Admin status object in the Resv message resetting the 
       R bit. 

       o  When the other transit nodes (OXC3, OXC2) receive the Admin 
       object in the Resv message with B bit set but with C bit unset, 
       they switch to unlock state. 

       o  When the ingress node OXC1 receives the Resv message with 
       Admin object containing B bit set and C bit unset switches to 
       unlock. 

       At this stage the Locking mechanism fails since the ingress 
       node has not received the confirmation of successful locking (C 
       bit set).

3. Security Considerations 

   Security considerations and requirements from [RFC4379] apply 
   equally to this document. Furthermore, there are some 
   additional security considerations that may be induced by the 
   extended RSVP-TE model proposed by this draft. These security 
   considerations will be added in a later version of the draft.     

4. IANA Considerations 

   IANA considerations are to be added in a later revision.
