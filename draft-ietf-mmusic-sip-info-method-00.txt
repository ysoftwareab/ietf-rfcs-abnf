Abstract

This document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol.
This extension adds the INFO method to the SIP protocol.  The intent
of the INFO method is to allow for the carrying of session related 
control information that is generated during a session.  Examples of
such session control information are ISUP/ISDN signaling messages
and DTMF digits used to control telephony services.

Internet draft           The SIP INFO Method            February 8, 1999

1.0 Introduction

There are situations where session related control information needs to
be sent during a session.  This information is separate from the media 
that is being exchanged as part of the session.

Two examples of this are motivated by telephony related services:

1 - Mid Call Telephony Signaling Messages
2 - DTMF Digit/Dial Plus Control of Telephony Services

It can also be envisioned that there will be non telephony inspired 
uses of a mechanism for relaying mid session information between 
participants of the session and to Proxy Servers interested in the
session.

This document proposes the addition of the INFO Request method to the
SIP specification.  

1.1 Mid Call Telephony Signaling Messages

The first use for the INFO method is the need to carry mid call 
signaling information resulting from the interworking between an ISUP 
or ISDN network/device and a SIP controlled network.  

One specific example of this interworking is when the SIP controlled
network is used for transport between two PSTN locations.  For this 
call, there will be a PSTN leg from the calling party to the SIP 
network, a SIP leg through the SIP network and a PSTN leg from the SIP 
network to the called party.  There needs to be a method to carry mid-
call PSTN signaling that is originated by the calling party through the
SIP network to the called party.

1.2 DTMF Digit/Dial Plus Control of Telephony Services

The second type of telephony session control information that needs to 
be carried during a session is DTMF or dial plus (refered to from here
on as DTMF) generated information.  There are various telephony services
implemented today which require the use of DTMF digits.  Due to the 
design of these features, the DTMF information needs to be carried both
as part of the media stream (in the RTP flow) and as part of the 
signaling or control path.  This is due to the fact that there is an 
implicit separation of the media and control path in the SIP protocol.
Thus, SIP Proxy Servers that implement services that require DTMF 
control and that are not in the media path require a mechanism to be 
notified of the DTMF digits.

2.0 INFO Method

The INFO method is used for communicating mid-session control 
information along the signaling path for the session.  The signaling
path for the INFO method is the signaling path established as a 
result of the session setup.  

The mid-session control information can be communicated in either
an INFO message header or as part of an attachment.  

If the control information is telephony signaling information than the
signaling message would be carried as part of an ISUP attachment to the
INFO message as described in draft-ietf-sigtran-mime-isup-00.txt.

The method for carrying the DTMF information in the INFO message has 
not yet been defined and is outside the scope of this document.

2.1 Header Field Support for INFO Method

The following table is an extension of tables 4 and 5 in the SIP
specification.  Refer to the SIP Specification for a description of

2.2 Responses to the INFO Request Method

A 200 OK response shall be sent if the INFO request was successful.

Request Failure (4xx), Server Failure (5xx) and Global Failure (6xx) 
responses can also be sent for the INFO Request.

2.3 Message Body Inclusion

The INFO request may contain a message body.

2.4 Behavior of SIP User Agents

The protocol rules applied by the SIP User Agent shall be similar to 
those applied used for the BYE request.  However, the INFO message shall
shall not change the state of the session.

2.5 Behavior of SIP Proxy and Redirect Servers

2.5.1 Proxy Server

The protocol rules applied by the SIP Proxy Server shall be similar to 
those applied used for the BYE request.  However, the INFO message shall
shall not change the state of the session.

2.5.2 Forking Proxy Server

The protocol rules applied by the SIP Forking Proxy Server shall be 
similar to those applied used for the BYE request.  However, the INFO 
message shall shall not change the state of the session.

2.5.3 Redirection Server

A redirection server should not receive the INFO method as it is a part
of the signaling path only at the initiation of the session.  As 
such, a redirection server should send a 403 Forbidden response.

2.6 Security Considerations

There are no security issues specific to the INFO method.  The security
requirements specified in the SIP specification apply to the INFO
method.
