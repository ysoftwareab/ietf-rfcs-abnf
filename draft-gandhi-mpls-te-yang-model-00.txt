Internet-Draft     Yang Data Model Trees for MPLS TE    October 13, 2014


1.  Introduction

   This document defines YANG [RFC6020] data model high-level tree
   structures for the management of Multi-Protocol Label Switching
   Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) [RFC3209] tunnels and links.  Resource
   Reservation Protocol (RSVP) signaled MPLS-TE tunnels can be
   represented as tunnel interfaces at the head-end Label Switching
   Router (LSR), and as Label Switched Paths (LSPs) at the head-end,
   mid-point and tail-end LSRs.

   The data model defined in this document includes configuration data,
   operational state data (status information and counters), execution
   requests using RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls), and event notifications
   pertaining to MPLS-TE tunnel interfaces, tunnel LSPs and MPLS-TE
   enabled links, as well as system-wide global MPLS-TE properties that
   relate to the behavior and operation of the TE enabled LSR node.

   Further modules augmenting this data model with advanced features can
   be handled in a future revision or a separate document.

2.1.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects
   are often used without a prefix, as long as it is clear from the
   context in which YANG module each name is defined.  Otherwise, names
   are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG module, as shown in Table 1.

3.  Objectives

   This section outlines some of the design objectives for the model:

   o  In case of existing implementations, it needs to map the data
   model defined in this document to their proprietary native data
   model.  To facilitate such mappings, the data model should be simple.

   o  The data model should be suitable for new implementations to use
   as is, without requiring a mapping to a different native model.

   o  Mapping to the MPLS-TE MIB Module should be clear.

   o  The data model should include read-only counters in order to
   gather statistics for sent and received octets and packets, received
   packets with errors, and packets that could not be sent due to
   errors.

   o  It should be straight forward to augment the base data model for
   advanced MPLS-TE features.


4.  MPLS-TE Data Models Overview

   MPLS-TE YANG data models are defined for various management
   components including configuration, operational state, execution
   commands and event notifications.  Following sections provide
   overview and some selective examples of these management components
   for global MPLS-TE, MPLS-TE tunnel interfaces, MPLS-TE tunnel LSPs
   and MPLS-TE enabled links.

4.1.  Global MPLS-TE Data Model Overview

   This module defines YANG model for configuration data, operational
   state data, execution commands and event notifications globally for
   MPLS-TE features.  

   1.  Global MPLS-TE configuration data model: The global MPLS-TE
   configuration data model is a read-write YANG data model that
   controls the LSR behavior system-wide.  Examples of such
   configuration items for global MPLS-TE are:

      o  Auto-tunnel backup: controls and manages the automatic 
         creation of fast reroute backup tunnels for protected 
         MPLS-TE enabled links.
      o  Auto-tunnel mesh-group: controls and manages the 
         creation of auto-tunnel mesh-groups.
      o  Auto-tunnel one-hop: controls and manages the

Internet-Draft     Yang Data Model Trees for MPLS TE    October 13, 2014


         creation of 1-hop auto-tunnels on MPLS-TE enabled links.
      o  Auto-bandwidth parameters: controls and manages the 
         auto-bandwidth specific system-wide properties.
      o  Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) TE parameters
      o  Names for SRLG values
      o  Names for link (extended) administrative groups (AG, EAG)
      o  MPLS-TE Diff-Serve classes: controls and manages the Diff-Serve
         TE (DS-TE) model and class-types
      o  System-wide timers that affect MPLS-TE features e.g.
          o  Flooding timers
          o  Re-optimization timers (periodic, installation, cleanup)
          o  Topology database stale timeout
      o  MPLS-TE attribute-sets: These are templates that can be used
         to instantiate tunnels and LSPs with identical configuration
         properties.
      o  System-wide capabilities that affect the originating, 
         traversing and terminating LSPs.  For example:
         o  Flooding parameters
         o  CSPF metric (TE or IGP)
         o  Handling for over-loaded nodes
         o  (Soft) preemption parameters 
         o  Path protection parameters at the head-end LSR
         o  Fast reroute parameters      

   2.  Global MPLS-TE state data model:  The global MPLS-TE state data
   model is a read-only YANG data model.  This module defines system-
   wide operational data for various MPLS-TE features.  Examples of such
   system-wide MPLS-TE states are:

      o  Global statistics (signaling, admission, preemption, flooding)
      o  Global counters (number of tunnel-interfaces/LSPs/links)

   3.  Global MPLS-TE execution data model: The global MPLS-TE execution
   model facilitates issuing commands to an LSR node and optionally
   returning responses.  This model uses RPC operations and contains
   optional read-only input and output data.  Examples of such global
   MPLS-TE commands are:

      o  Clear global MPLS-TE statistics of various features

   4.  Global MPLS-TE events notification data model:  The global MPLS-
   TE events notification model uses configuration data for
   registration.  Node notifies the registered events to the server
   using notification messages.  Notifications carry read-only data in
   the messages.  Example of such global MPLS-TE events are:

      o  Backup tunnel FRR active and not-active state transition events

      o  State information (Up/Down: when and reason)
      o  Traffic counters for the tunnel interface
      o  History of events

   3.  MPLS-TE tunnel interface execution data model: The execution
   model facilitates issuing commands to an LSR node and optionally

   TE tunnel interfaces are:

      o  Clear statistics for all or for individual tunnel interfaces

   4.  MPLS-TE tunnel interface events notification data model: The

6.1.  MPLS-TE Global Attribute-set Lists

   The data model for mpls-te-attribute-sets presented in this document
   uses a flat list of attribute-sets.  Each attribute-set in the list
   is identified by its name.  An attribute-set is a configuration
   template that can be used to instantiate tunnels and LSPs with
   identical properties.

   There is one list for MPLS-TE attribute-set configurations
   ("/mpls-te-attribute-sets/attribute-set") and a separate list for
   operational state data ("/mpls-te-attribute-sets-state/attribute-

6.2.  MPLS-TE Global Mesh-group Lists

   The data model for mpls-te-mesh-groups presented in this document
   uses a flat list of mesh-groups.  Each mesh-group in the list is

7.1.  MPLS-TE Tunnel Interface Lists

   The data model for mpls-te-tunnel-ifs presented in this document uses
   a flat list of tunnel-ifs.  Each tunnel interface in the list is
   identified by its name.  Furthermore, each tunnel interface has a
   mandatory "tunnel-type" leaf.

15.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control model
   [RFC6536] provides means to restrict access for particular NETCONF
   users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., <edit-config>)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  Following are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
