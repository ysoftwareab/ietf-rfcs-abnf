1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   In our daily life, users always using their mother language to create
   alternative names for devices (eg.  PC or game machine), those
   alternative names will be different from the model number of those
   devices.  Many users are naming their devices with such nicknames of
   internationalized strings.  These strings have very high flexibility
   by using various of characters sets.  For example, symbols like the
   Tilde mark ("WAVE DASH"(U+301C) it's not "FULLWIDTH TILDE"(U+FF5E))
   in Japanese, which is used instead of the "KATAKANA-HIRAGANA
   PROLONGED SOUND MARK"(U+30FC), has being used as product names or
   part of adjective words in many kinds of fields.  In the Internet
   environment especially for IoT devices, nicknames like this may be
   given to device or as part of the device name.  To look up the
   devices by the names registered in database, it is necessary to take
   more appropriate and flexible preparation.  So that it could be more
   compatible for any assumed character that provided by different input
   methods of applications.

   To increase the matching possibility that customized device
   alternative names described as above can be utilized correctly as
   internet resources, this document defines rules for preparing and
   comparing customized alternative names for devices, so that the
   accuracy of comparison result between alternative names strings could
   be improved.

1.2.  Differences from other PRECIS Profile

   TBD.

1.3.  Terminology

   Many important terms used in this document are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-precis-framework] and [Unicode].  The key words "MUST",
   "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Rules

   A alternative name MUST NOT be zero bytes in length.  This rule is to
   be enforced after any mapping or normalization of code points.

   A alternative name MUST consist only of Unicode code points that
   conform to the "FreeformClass" base string class defined in
   [I-D.ietf-precis-framework].

   For preparation purposes, an application MUST only ensure that the
   string conforms to the "FreeformClass" base string class defined in
   [I-D.ietf-precis-framework]; however, it MAY also perform the mapping
   and normalization operations specified below for comparison.

   For comparison purposes, an application MUST treat a alternative name
   as follows, where the operations specified MUST be completed in the
   order shown:

   1.  Fullwidth and halfwidth characters MUST be mapped to their
       decomposition equivalents.

   2.  Additional mappings MAY be applied, such as those defined in
       [I-D.ietf-precis-framework] and [I-D.ietf-precis-mappings].  In
       the Additional Mappings, the rules of adapted Special Mapping are
       as below:

       1.  Non-ASCII space characters from the "N" category defined
           under Section 7.14 of [I-D.ietf-precis-framework] MUST be
           mapped to U+0020 SPACE.

       2.  Interior sequences of more than one ASCII space character
           MUST be mapped to a single ASCII space character.

       3.  Leading and trailing whitespace MUST be removed.

   3.  Uppercase and titlecase characters MUST be mapped to their
       lowercase equivalents using Unicode Default Case Folding.  Local
       Case Mapping is applicable alternatively.

   4.  Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC) MUST be applied to all
       characters.

   With regard to directionality, the "Bidi Rule" provided in [RFC5893]
   applies.

3.  Security Considerations

3.1.  Reuse of PRECIS

   The security considerations described in [I-D.ietf-precis-framework]
   apply to the "FreeformClass" base string class used in this document
   for alternative names, respectively.

3.2.  Reuse of Unicode

   The security considerations described in [UTR39] apply to the use of
   Unicode characters in alternative names.

3.3.  Visually Similar Characters

   [[I-D.ietf-precis-framework] describes some of the security
   considerations related to visually similar characters, also called
   "confusable characters" or "confusables".  Although the mapping rules
   under Section 2 are designed in part to reduce the possibility of
   confusion about alternative names, this document does not yet provide
   more detailed recommendations regarding the handling of visually
   similar characters, such as those in [UTR39].  However, a future
   version of this document might provide such recommendations.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA shall add the following entry to the PRECIS Profiles
   Registry:

   Name: Alternative Names FreeformClass.
   Applicability: TBD.
   Base Class: FreeformClass.
   Replaces: None.
   Width Mapping: Map fullwidth and halfwidth characters to their
   decomposition mappings.
   Additional Mappings: Map non-ASCII space characters to ASCII space,
   map interior sequences of multiple space characters to a single ASCII
   space, strip leading and trailing space characters.

   Case Mapping: For comparison purposes, map uppercase and titlecase
   characters to lowercase using Unicode Default Case Folding.  Local
   Case Mapping is applicable alternatively.
   Normalization: NFC.
   Directionality: The "Bidi Rule" defined in RFC 5893 applies.
   Exclusions: None.
   Enforcement: To be specified by applications.
   Specification: RFC XXXX.
