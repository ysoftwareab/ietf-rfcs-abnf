              SIP URI Inter Operator Traffic Leg parameter
                  draft-holmberg-dispatch-iotl-00.txt

Abstract

   In telecommunication networks, the signalling path between a calling
   user and a called user can be divided into smaller parts, referred to
   as traffic legs.  Each traffic leg may span networks belonging to
   different operators, and will have its own characteristics that can
   be different from other traffic legs in the same call.  The
   directionality in traffic legs relates to a SIP request creating a
   dialogue and stand-alone SIP request.

   This document defines a new SIP URI parameter, 'iotl', which can be
   used in a SIP URI to indicate that the entity associated with the
   address, or an entity responsible for the host part of the address,
   represents the end of a specific traffic leg.

   The 'iotl' parameter is defined in order to fulfil requirements from
   the 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), but it can also be
   used in other network environments.

1.  Introduction

   In a telecommunication network, an end user can be attached (e.g.
   using a radio access network) to its own operator network (home

   network), or to another operator's network (visited network).  In the
   latter case the user is referred to as a roaming user.

   Telecommunication operator networks are often not connected directly
   to each other.  Instead, there might be intermediate networks,
   referred to as transit networks, between them.  A transit network
   might act on a SIP level or on IP level.

   In telecommunication networks, the signalling path between a calling
   user and a called user can be divided into smaller parts, referred to
   as traffic legs.  Each traffic leg may span networks belonging to
   different operators, and will have its own characteristics that can
   be different from other traffic legs in the same call.  The
   directionality in traffic legs relates to a SIP request creating a
   dialogue and stand-alone SIP request.

   The traffic leg information can be used by intermediary entities to
   make policy decisions, related to e.g. media anchoring, signalling
   policy, insertion of media functions (e.g. transcoder) and charging.

   The figure below shows two users (Alice and Bob) and the different
   type of networks that the signaling might traverse.  The signalling
   path can be divided into multiple traffic legs, and the type of
   traffic legs depends on how the signalling is routed.

   Alice -- ORIG HNW +++++ TRANSIT NW +++++ TERM HNW -- Bob
   Home           +     +                +    +   +    Home

   Alice is attached to an originating network, which is either the home
   network of Alice, or a visited network (in case Alice is roaming).
   In both cases any originating service is provided by the home network
   of Alice.

   Bob is attached to a terminating network, which is either the home
   network of Bob, or a visited network (in case Bob is roaming).  In
   both cases any terminating service is provided by the home network of
   Bob.

   A transit network, providing transit functions (e.g. translation of
   free phone numbers), may be included between the originating and
   terminating networks and between visited and home networks.

   This document defines a new SIP URI parameter [RFC3261], 'iotl',
   which can be used in a SIP URI to indicate that the entity associated
   with the address, or an entity responsible for the host part of the
   address, represents the end of a specific traffic leg.

   The 'iotl' parameter is defined in order to fulfil requirements from
   the 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), but it can also be
   used in other network environments.

2.  Use-cases

2.1.  General

   This section describes examples of different types of traffic legs in
   3GPP networks.

2.2.  Originating roaming call

   In this case, Alice is located in a visited network.  When Alice
   sends the initial SIP INVITE request for a call, one traffic leg
   (referred to as the 'visitedA-homeA' traffic leg) represents the
   signalling path between the UA of Alice and the home S-CSCF of Alice.

2.3.  Terminating roaming call

   In this case, Bob is located in a visited network.  When the home
   S-CSCF of Bob forwards the initial SIP INVITE request for a call
   towards Bob, one traffic leg (referred to as the 'homeB-visitedB'
   traffic leg) represents the signalling path between the home S-CSCF
   of Bob and the UA of Bob.

Internet-DraftSIP URI Inter Operator Traffic Leg parameter    April 2014


2.4.  Originating home to terminating home call

   In this case, the home S-CSCF of Alice forwards the initial SIP
   INVITE request towards the home S-CSCF of Bob. The signalling path
   between the S-CSCFs represents one traffic leg (referred to as the
   'homeA-homeB' traffic leg).

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4.  iotl SIP URI parameter

4.1.  Usage

   As specified in [RFC3261], when a SIP entity inserts a SIP URI in an
   initial request for a dialog, or in a stand-alone request, the SIP
   URI will be used to route the request to another SIP entity,
   addressed by the SIP URI, or to a SIP entity responsible for the host
   part of the SIP URI (e.g. a SIP registrar).  If such entity
   represents the end of a traffic leg, the SIP entity inserting the SIP
   URI can add a SIP URI 'iotl' parameter to the SIP URI, to indicate
   the type of traffic leg.

   For routing of a SIP request, a SIP entity can add the 'iotl'
   parameter to the SIP URI of the Request-URI [RFC3261], or to the SIP
   URI of a Route header field [RFC3261], of an initial request for a
   dialog, or of an stand-alone request.

   During SIP registration [RFC3261], entities can add the 'iotl'
   parameter to the SIP URI of a Path or Service-Route header field, if
   the entity is aware that SIP URI will be used to indicate the end of
   a specific traffic leg for initial requests for dialogs, or stand-
   alone requests, sent on the registration path.

   This document does not specify the usage of the 'iotl' parameter
   within a SIP URI of a Record-Route header field [RFC3261].

4.2.  Parameter Values

4.2.1.  General

   This section describes the SIP URI 'iotl' parameter values defined in
   this specification.

Internet-DraftSIP URI Inter Operator Traffic Leg parameter    April 2014


4.2.2.  homeA-homeB

   This value indicates that a SIP entity responsible for the host part
   of the SIP URI associated with the parameter represents the end of a
   traffic leg between the home network (originating) of the calling
   user and the home network (terminating) of the called user.

   In 3GPP, this traffic leg is between two S-CSCFs.

4.2.3.  homeB-visitedB

   This value indicates that the SIP entity addressed by the SIP URI
   associated with the parameter represents the end of a traffic leg
   between the home network (terminating) of the called user and the
   visited network (terminating) in which the called user is located.

   In 3GPP, this traffic leg is between the home S-CSCF and the UE of
   the called user, or between the Service Centralization and Continuity
   Application Server (SCC AS) in the home network of the called user
   and Access Transfer Control Function (ATCF) in the visited network of
   the called user.

4.2.4.  visitedA-homeA

   This value indicates that a SIP entity responsible for the host part
   of the SIP URI associated with the parameter represents the end of a
   traffic leg between the visited network (originating) in which the
   calling user is located and the home network (originating) of the
   calling user.

   In 3GPP, this traffic leg is between the UE and the home S-CSCF of
   the calling user, or between the P-CSCF in the visited network,
   serving the calling user, and the home S-CSCF of the calling user.

4.2.5.  homeA-visitedA

   This value indicates that the SIP entity addressed by the SIP URI
   associated with the parameter represents the end of a traffic leg
   between the home network (originating) and the visited network
   (originating) in which the calling user is located.

   In 3GPP, this traffic leg is between the home S-CSCF of the calling
   user and the Transit and Roaming Function (TRF) [3GPP TS 24.229]
   serving the calling user, and exists in scenarios where the home
   S-CSCF of the calling user forwards a request back to the visited
   network where the UE of the calling user is located.  An example of
   this is when the Roaming Architecture for Voice over IMS with Local
   breakout (RAVEL) [3GPP TS 24.229] feature is enabled.

Internet-DraftSIP URI Inter Operator Traffic Leg parameter    April 2014


4.2.6.  visitedA-homeB

   This value indicates that a SIP entity responsible for the host part
   of the SIP URI associated with the parameter represents represents
   the end of a traffic leg between the visited network (originating) of
   the calling user and the home network (terminating) of the called
   user.

   In 3GPP, this traffic leg is between the Transit and Roaming Function
   (TRF) [3GPP TS 24.229] serving the calling user and the home S-CSCF
   of the called user, and exists in scenarios where a request is
   forwarded from the visited network where the calling user is located
   directly to the home S-CSCF of the called user.  An example of this
   is when the Roaming Architecture for Voice over IMS with Local
   breakout (RAVEL) [3GPP TS 24.229] feature is enabled.

5.  Syntax

5.1.  General

   This section defines the ABNF for the 'iotl' SIP URI parameter.  The
   ABNF defined in this specification is conformant to RFC 5234
   [RFC5234].

5.2.  ABNF

   The ABNF [RFC5234] grammar for the role SIP URI parameter is:

 uri-parameter = transport-param / user-param / method-param / ttl-param
                 / maddr-param / lr-param / iotl-param / other-param
 iotl-param    = iotl-tag "=" iotl-value
 iotl-tag      = "iotl"
 iotl-value    = "homeA-homeB" / "homeB-visitedB" / "visitedA-homeA"
                 / "homeA-visitedA" /" visitedA-homeB" / gen-value

6.  Security Considerations

   There SHOULD exis a trust relationship between the networks that
   provide the roaming role and the networks that use the information
   for making policy decisions based on the role.  In addition, there
   MUST exist an agreement between the operators for usage of the
   roaming role information.

7.  IANA Considerations

   [RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please replace RFC-XXXX with the RFC number of this
   document.]  This specification adds one new value to the IANA
