                    Extended Message support for BGP
                draft-ietf-idr-bgp-extended-messages-11

Abstract

   The BGP specification mandates a maximum BGP message size of 4096
   octets.  As BGP is extended to support newer AFI/SAFIs, there is a
   need to extend the maximum message size beyond 4096 octets.  This
   document updates the BGP specification in RFC4271 by providing an
   extension to BGP to extend its current message size from 4096 octets
   to 65535 octets.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to
   be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] only when they
   appear in all upper case.  They may also appear in lower or mixed
   case as English words, without normative meaning.

   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

1.  Introduction

   The BGP specification RFC4271 [RFC4271] mandates a maximum BGP
   message size of 4096 octets.  As BGP is extended to support newer
   AFI/SAFIs and newer capabilities (e.g.,
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-overview]), there is a need to extend the
   maximum message size beyond 4096 octets.  This draft provides an
   extension to BGP to extend its current message size limit from 4096
   octets to 65535 octets.

2.  BGP Extended Message

   A BGP message over 4096 octets in length is a BGP Extended Message.

   BGP Extended Messages have maximum message size of 65535 octets.  The
   smallest message that may be sent consists of a BGP header without a
   data portion (19 octets).

   Multi-octet fields MUST be in network byte order.

3.  Extended message Capability for BGP

   To advertise the BGP Extended Message Capability to a peer, a BGP
   speaker uses BGP Capabilities Advertisement [RFC5492].  By
   advertising the BGP Extended Message Capability to a peer, a BGP
   speaker conveys that it is able to send, receive, and properly handle
   BGP Extended Messages.

   A peer which does not advertise this capability MUST NOT send BGP
   Extended Messages, and BGP Extended Messages MUST NOT be sent to it.

   The BGP Extended Message Capability is a new BGP Capability [RFC5492]
   defined with Capability code TBD and Capability length 0.

4.  Operation

   A BGP speaker that is willing to send and receive BGP Extended
   Messages from its peer should advertise the BGP Extended Message
   Capability to its peer using BGP Capabilities Advertisement
   [RFC5492].  A BGP speaker may send extended messages to its peer only
   if it has received the Extended Message Capability from its peer.

   An implementation that supports the BGP Extended Messages MUST be
   prepared to receive an OPEN message that is larger than 4096 bytes.

   Applications generating messages which might be encapsulated within
   BGP messages MUST limit the size of their payload to take into
   account the maximum message size and all encapsulation overheads on
   the path the encapsulated data are expected to traverse.

5.  Error Handling

   A BGP speaker that has the ability to use extended messages but has
   not advertised the BGP Extended Messages capability, presumably due
   to configuration, SHOULD NOT accept such a message.

   However, a BGP speaker that does not advertise the BGP Extended
   Messages capability might also genuinely not support extended
   messages.  Such a speaker would be expected to follow the error
   handling procedures of [RFC4221], Section 6.1, and reset the session
   with a Bad Message Length NOTIFICATION if it receives an extended
   message.  A speaker that treats an improper extended message as a
   fatal error should do likewise.

   and Job Snijders for their input.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to register a new BGP Capability Code to be
   named BGP Extended Message Capability and referring to this document.

   Registry:  BGP Capability Code

   Value    Description                               Document
   -----    -----------------------------------       -------------

   ...
   TBD      BGP-Extended Message                      [this draft]

8.  Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change BGP's underlying security
   issues.
