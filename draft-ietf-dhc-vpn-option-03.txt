Internet Draft         DHCP VPN Information option        September 2004


Abstract

   This memo defines a new DHCP option for passing VPN information
   between the DHCP client and the DHCP server.  It is intended for use
   primarily by DHCP proxy clients in situations where VPN information
   needs to be passed to the DHCP server for proper address allocation
   to take place.

1.0 Introduction

   There is a growing use of Virtual Private Network (VPN)
   configurations.  The growth comes from many areas; individual client
   systems needing to appear to be on the home corporate network even
   when traveling, ISPs providing extranet connectivity for customer
   companies, etc.  In some of these cases there is a need for the DHCP
   server to know the VPN from which an address, and other resources,
   should be allocated.

   If the allocation is being done through a DHCP relay, then a relay
   suboption could be included.  In some cases, however an IP address is
   being sought by a DHCP proxy on behalf of a client (would may be
   assigned the address via a different protocol).  In this case, there
   is a need to include VPN information relating to the client as a DHCP
   option.

   A good example might be a dial-in aggregation device where PPP
   addresses are acquired via DHCP and then given to the remove customer
   system via IPCP.  In a network where such a device is used to
   aggregate PPP dial-in from multiple companies, each company may be
   assigned a unique VPN.

   This memo defines a new DHCP [2] option, the VPN Information option,
   which allows the DHCP client to specify the VPN Information needed in
   order to allocate an address.  If the receiving DHCP server
   understands the VPN Information option, this information may be used
   in conjunction with other information in determining the subnet on
   which to select an address as well as other information such as DNS
   server, default router, etc.

1.1 Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [3].

Internet Draft         DHCP VPN Information option        September 2004


2.0 VPN Information Option Definition

   The VPN Information option is a DHCP option [3].  The option contains
   generalized VPN information in one of two formats: NVT ASCII VPN
   identifier, or RFC2685 VPN-ID [4].

   The format of the option is:

       Code   Len   Type   VPN Information octets
      +-----+-----+------+-----+-----+-----+---
      | TBD |  n  |  t   | v1  | v2  | v3  | ...
      +-----+-----+------+-----+-----+-----+---

      Type:   0       NVT ASCII VPN identifier
              1       RFC2685 VPN-ID
              2-255   Not Allowed

   The option minimum length (n) is 2.

   There are two types of identifiers which can be placed in the VPN
   Information Option. The first type of identifier which can be placed
   in the VPN Information Option is an NVT ASCII string.  It MUST NOT be
   terminated with a zero byte.

   The second type of identifier which can be placed in the VPN
   Information Option is an RFC2685 VPN-ID [4], which is typically 14
   hex digits in length (though it can be any length as far as the VPN
   Information Option is concerned).

   If the type field is set to zero (0), it indicates that all following
   bytes of the option contain a NVT ASCII string.  This string MUST NOT
   be terminated with a zero byte.

   If the type field is set to one (1), it indicates that all following
   bytes should be interpreted in agreement with [4] as a VPN
   Identifier, typically 14 hex digits.

   All other values of the type field are invalid as of this memo and
   VPN options containing any other value than zero (0) or one (1)
   SHOULD be ignored.

   Any VPN information contained in a DHCP Relay Suboption SHOULD
   override the information contained in this VPN Information option.

   Servers configured to support this option MUST return an identical
   copy of the option to any client that sends it, regardless of whether
   or not the client requests the option in a parameter request list.
   Clients using this option MUST discard DHCPOFFER or DHCPACK packets



Johnson, et. al.                                                [Page 3]

   that do not contain this option.

   This option provides the DHCP server additional information upon
   which to make a determination of address to be assigned.  The DHCP
   server, if it is configure to support this option, should use this
   information in addition to other options included in the DHCPDISCOVER
   packet in order to assign an IP address for DHCP client.

   In the event that a VPN Informmation Option and a VPN Information
   Relay Suboption are both received in a particular DHCP client packet,
   the information from the VPN Information Suboption MUST be used in
   preference to the information in the VPN Information Option.

   Servers that do not understand this option will allocate an address
   using their normal algorithms and will not return this option in the
   DHCPOFFER or DHCPACK. In this case the client will discard the
   DHCPOFFER or DHCPACK. Servers that understand this option but are
   administratively configured to ignore the option MUST ignore the
   option, use their normal algorithms to allocate an address, and MUST
   NOT return this option in the DHCPOFFER or DHCPACK. In this case the
   client will discard the DHCPOFFER or DHCPACK.  In other words, this
   option MUST NOT appear in a DHCPOFFER from a server unless it was
   used by the server in making the address allocation requested.

   This option SHOULD NOT be used without also making use of the DHCP
   Authentication option [5].


3.0 Security Considerations

   Message authentication in DHCP for intradomain use where the out-of-
   band exchange of a shared secret is feasible is defined in [5].
   Potential exposures to attack are discussed in section 7 of the DHCP
   protocol specification in [2].

   The VPN Information option could be used by a client in order to
   obtain an IP address from a VPN other than the one where it should.
   DHCP relays MAY choose to remove the option before passing on
   DHCPDISCOVER packets.  Another possible defense would be for the DHCP
   relay to insert a Relay option containing a VPN Information
   Suboption, which would override the DHCP VPN Information option.

   This option would allow a client to perform a more complete address-
   pool exhaustion attack since the client would no longer be restricted
   to attacking address-pools on just its local subnet.

   Servers that implement the VPN Information option MUST by default
   disable use of the feature; it must specifically be enabled through

   configuration. Moreover, a server SHOULD provide the ability to
   selectively enable use of the feature under restricted conditions,
   e.g., by enabling use of the option only from explicitly configured
   client-ids, enabling its use only by clients on a particular subnet,
   or restricting the VPNs from which addresses may be requested.


4.0 IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned a value of TBD for the DHCP option code described
   in this document.  No assignment of values for the type field need be
   made at this time.  New values may only be defined by IETF Consensus,
   as described in [6].  Basically, this means that they are defined by
   RFCs approved by the IESG.

   Moreover, any changes or additions to the type byte codes MUST be
   made concurrently in the type byte codes of the VPN Information
   Option.  The type bytes and data formats of the VPN Information
   Option and VPN Information Suboption MUST always be identical.
