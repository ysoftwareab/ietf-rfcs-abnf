a = b = X the action causes the value of the expression following
methodState=CONT: The method always continues at this point (and the
      peer wants to continue it). The decision variable is always set to
      FAIL.

methodState=MAY_CONT: At this point, the authenticator can decide
      either to continue the method or end the conversation. The
      decision variable tells us what to do in the case the conversation
      ends. If the current situation does not satisfy the peer's
      security policy (that is, if the authenticator now decides to
      allow access, the peer will not use it), set decision=FAIL.
      Otherwise, set decision=COND_SUCC.

methodState=DONE: The method never continues at this point, (or the
      peer sees no point in continuing it).

      If either (a) the authenticator has informed us that it will not
      allow access, or (b) we're not willing to talk to this
      authenticator (e.g. our security policy is not satisfied), set
decision=FAIL. (Note that this state can occur even if the method
decision=COND_SUCC.

allowNotifications=TRUE.  Otherwise, set allowNotifications=FALSE.
