     2.  Abstract

     This  document  defines  the  ''PPP Authentication Operation'' for LDAP.
     This operation provides for PPP authentication in an LDAP  association
     and is defined in terms of an LDAP extended operation.  It is believed
     that an LDAP extended operation is the appropriate mechanism for  pro-
     viding  this  support,  since  current LDAP security mechanisms do not
     support PPP authentication methods. In addition, requiring a BIND  and
     UNBIND  for  each  authentication  results in an unacceptable level of
     overhead.

     It is expected that this extended operation will be  useful  in  inte-
     grating authentication protocols such as RADIUS and TACACS+ with LDAP-
     based directory  services.  Consolidation  of  information  stores  is
     desirable  since  it results in lessened administrative workload and a
     consistent view of user information throughout the enterprise.


     3.  Introduction

     Currently RADIUS (described in  [6]-[8])  and  TACACS+  (described  in
     [12])  authentication  servers  typically  include their own stores of



     Aboba                                                         [Page 1]

     user data. In order to simplify user administration, it  is  desirable
     to  be  able  to integrate these services with an LDAP-based directory
     service.

     This document is one of three related  specifications  which  describe
     how  a  RADIUS  server  may be integrated with an LDAP-based directory
     service. Reference [16] specifies how user data utilized by  a  RADIUS
     server  may  be  stored in an LDAP-based directory service.  Reference
     [17] describes a schema designed for tracking  sessions  in  progress.
     Such  information  can  be  useful for a variety of purposes including
     security incident response; simultaneous usage control; or  monitoring
     of connection quality, login time, packet size or bandwidth usage. Due
     to the frequency of changes to this data, dynamic attributes  must  be
     employed, as described in [5].

     PPP  authentication  protocols  are  described  in [11],[14] and [15].
     This document describes an LDAP  extension  supporting  validation  of
     user  credentials  submitted  during PPP authentication. This makes it
     possible for the RADIUS server to validate user  credentials  received
     in the Access-Request packet.


     3.1.  Alternatives for integration of PPP authentication methods

     In  order  for  a  RADIUS  server  to be able to respond to an Access-
     Request, a means must be available for  validating  user  credentials.
     However, current LDAP security mechanisms do not support PPP authenti-
     cation methods  so  that  extensions  or  protocol  modifications  are
     required.

     Several  alternatives  present  themselves.  One alternative is to add
     support for PPP authentication methods to SASL, and utilize the secure
     BIND  mechanisms  described  in  [18]. In this alternative, the RADIUS
     server will impersonate the user and bind using the  credentials  sub-
     mitted  in  the  Access-Request. In this scenario, only the user would
     need to have the access rights to retrieve RADIUS attributes from  the
     directory. There would not be a need to make these attributes accessi-
     ble to a privileged account used by the RADIUS server, or to any  net-
     work  devices.  This  is desirable from a security point of view. How-
     ever, we believe that this alternative involves an unacceptable  level
     of  overhead,  since  it requires setting up an SSL/TLS connection for
     each incoming request, in addition to requiring a BIND and UNBIND.

     Another alternative is  to  provide  support  for  PPP  authentication
     within  an  LDAP  extended  operation. In this alternative, the RADIUS
     server binds to the directory on startup using a special account,  and
     unbinds on shutdown. In between the bind and unbind, the RADIUS server
     may submit as many PPP authentication requests as necessary.  In  this
     scenario,  the  account  used  by  the RADIUS server needs to have the
     access rights to retrieve RADIUS attributes for any user.

     It is believed that this approach is more efficient, since the  RADIUS
     server may use the existing SSL/TLS connection, and need not execute a
     BIND and UNBIND request for every authentication.

     3.2.  Overview

     PPP Authentication is an  extended  operation  initiated  by  an  LDAP
     client (RADIUS server) in order to request authentication of a user by
     the LDAP-based directory. The LDAP client sends a  PPP  Authentication
     request  to the LDAP server, indicating the PPP authentication method,
     and including the user's credentials, and  the  server  then  responds
     with  a  message  indicating the success or failure of the authentica-
     tion.

     When the RADIUS server receives an Access-Request packet from a NAS or
     VPN  server, it examines the User-Name attribute to determine the user
     that is being authenticated. Based on the User-Name,  the  server  may
     also  retrieve the authenticationType attribute for the user, and will
     then check the authentication method specified in  the  Access-Request
     against  the permitted types. If there is a mis-match, then the server
     will formulate and send an Access-Reject packet.

     If the authentication indicated in the Access-Request is  one  of  the
     permitted  types,  and  PAP  or CHAP authentication is being used, the
     RADIUS server utilizes the LDAP extension for PPP authentication spec-
     ified  in this document in order to verify the user's identity. Alter-
     natively, the PPP authentication operation may  be  carried  out  syn-
     chronously  with retrieval of the RADIUS attributes described in [16],
     and an Access-Reject can be sent if an authentication type mismatch is
     detected  after  the  retrieval  (and  possibly the PPP authentication
     operation) is complete.

     If the user authentication is unsuccessful,  then  the  RADIUS  server
     will  formulate  and send an Access-Reject packet. If the user is suc-
     cessfully authenticated, then the  RADIUS  server  will  formulate  an
     Access-Accept  based  on  the attributes retreived from the LDAP-based
     directory service, specified in [16].

     If the Access-Request contains an EAP-Message attribute with a  speci-
     fied identity, then the RADIUS server will retrieve the user's RADIUS-
     related information from the LDAP-based directory service in order  to
     determine  the  type of EAP authentication for this user. Depending on
     the eapType, the RADIUS server will then either handle the authentica-
     tion  internally  (such  as  for MD5), or may forward the request to a
     security  server.  As  a  result,  the  PPP  authentication  operation
     described in this document does not need to support EAP.


     4.  Protocol Additions


     4.1.  The Start PPP Authentication Operation

     A client may perform a PPP authentication operation by transmitting an
     LDAP PDU containing an ExtendedRequest.  An  LDAP  ExtendedREquest  is
     defined as follows:

     ExtendedRequest ::= [APPLICATION 23] SEQUENCE {



     Aboba                                                         [Page 3]





     INTERNET-DRAFT                                         6 November 1997


                      requestName             [0] LDAPOID,
                      requestValue            [1] OCTET STRING }

     The   requestName  field  must  be  set  to  the  string  "<OID-to-be-
     assigned>".

     This request is permitted to be invoked when LDAP is carried by a con-
     nectionless transport.

     When  using  a  connection-oriented transport, there is no requirement
     that this operation be on the same particular connection as any other.
     A  client  may  open  multiple connections, or close and then reopen a
     connection.


     4.1.1.  CHAP Authentication

     When Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) authentication
     is  desired,  the  requestValue field will contain as a value the DER-
     encoding of the following ASN.1 data type:

             SEQUENCE {
                     authenticationProtocol  [0] INTEGER,
                     algorithm               [1] INTEGER,
                     name                    [2] OCTET STRING,
                     challenge               [3] OCTET STRING,
                     chapIdent               [4] OCTET STRING,
                     response                [5] OCTET STRING
             }

     The authenticationProtocol field is an integer containing the  Authen-
     tication-Protocol  number  for  CHAP,  c223 (hex). The algorithm is an
     integer indicating the one-way hash method to be used. Values  include
     MD5  (5).  The  name  is  an  octet  string identifying the user to be
     authenticated. The challenge is a 16 octet string containing the  CHAP
     challenge sent by the NAS to a PPP CHAP user.  The chapIdent is a sin-
     gle octet containing the CHAP Identifer from the user's CHAP Response.
     The response is a 16 octet field containing the CHAP Response from the
     user.


     4.1.2.  PAP Authentication

     When Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) authentication is desired,
     the requestValue field will contain as a value the DER-encoding of the
     following ASN.1 data type:

             SEQUENCE {
                     authenticationProtocol  [0] INTEGER,
                     name                    [1] OCTET STRING,
                     password                [2] OCTET STRING
             }

     The  authenticationProtocol  field  is  an  integer   containing   the



     Aboba                                                         [Page 4]





     INTERNET-DRAFT                                         6 November 1997


     Authentication-Protocol  number  for  PAP,  c023 (hex). The name is an
     octet string identifying the user to be authenticated. The password is
     an octet string providing the user's password.


     4.2.  PPP Authentication Response


     If  a  server implements this extension, then when the request is made
     it will return an LDAP PDU containing an  ExtendedResponse.   An  LDAP
     ExtendedResponse is defined as follows:

              ExtendedResponse ::= [APPLICATION 24] SEQUENCE {
                     responseName            [0] LDAPOID OPTIONAL,
                     response                [1] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
                     standardResponse        [2] LDAPResult }

     The responseName field contains the same string as that present in the
     PPP Authentication request. The response field is absent.  The  server
     MUST  set  the resultCode of the standardResponse to either success or
     one of the other values outlined below.


     4.3.  Error Messages

     If the operation was successful, the errorCode field in the  standard-
     Response part of an ExtendedResponse will be set to success.

     In  case  of an error, the errorCode field will contain an appropriate
     value. If the authentication is not successful (due either to  invalid
     credentials  or an invalid userName), the errorCode field will contain
     the invalidCredentials result code.  If  the  authentication  protocol
     given  by  authenticationProtocol  could not be located, the errorCode
     field will contain the protocolError result code.  If the  authentica-
     tion  protocol  is  not  permitted,  the  errorCode field will contain
     strongAuthRequired.  If the requester does not have permission to per-
     form the PPP authentication, the errorCode field will contain insuffi-
     cientAccessRights. If the server does not do PPP  authentication,  but
     knows  another  server  that  does,  the  errorCode field will contain
     referral. If There is a major problem with PPP authentication, or  the
     server  is shutting down the errorCode field will contain unavailable.
     If the server is overloaded, the errorCode field will contain busy.

     If a server does not implement this extension, it will return an  LDAP
     PDU  containing an ExtendedResponse, which contains only the standard-
     Response element (the  responseName  and  response  elements  will  be
     absent).   The  LDAPResult  element  will  indicate  the protocolError
     result code.


     5.  Security considerations

     Enabling an LDAP-based directory service to perform PPP authentication
     operations  in  an efficient manner may result in a number of security



     Aboba                                                         [Page 5]

     threats, including password guessing attacks and sniffing attacks.

     In order to prevent a rogue RADIUS  server  from  initiating  password
     guessing  attacks,  it  is  desirable for an implementation to close a
     connection after a number of consecutive authentication failures.

     In order to prevent sniffing of passwords, where PAP authentication is
     being  used for transmission of cleartext passwords, the RADIUS server
     MUST seek to ensure confidentiality by using SSL/TLS or IPSEC. An LDAP
     server receiving a PAP authentication request representing a cleartext
     password without confidentiality services  in  place  MUST  return  an
     error message.
