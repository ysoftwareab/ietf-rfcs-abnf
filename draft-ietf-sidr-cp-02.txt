Abstract 

   This document describes the certificate policy for a PKI used to 
   support improved routing security. Each organization that allocates 
   IP addresses or Autonomous System (AS) numbers to an organization 
   will, in parallel, issue a certificate reflecting this allocation. 
   These certificates will enable verification that the holder of the

   associated private key has been allocated the resources indicated in 
   the certificate, and is the current, unique holder of these 
   resources. The PKI in which the certificates issued under this 
   policy are employed, in conjunction with ancillary digitally signed 
   data structures, will provide critical inputs for routing security 
   mechanisms, e.g., generation of route filters by ISPs.

Internet-Draft     Cert Policy for IP Addr/AS# PKI           July 2007 
    

 

1. Introduction 

   This document describes the certificate policy for a PKI used to 
   support improved routing security. An organization that allocates IP 
   addresses or Autonomous System (AS) numbers to an organization will, 
   in parallel, issue a certificate reflecting this allocation. These 
   certificates will enable verification that the holder of the 
   associated private key has been allocated the resources indicated in 
   the certificate, and is the current, unique holder of these 
   resources. The PKI in which the certificates issued under this 
   policy are employed can be used in a number of ways, for example, in 
   conjunction with ancillary digitally signed data structures, it can 
   be used to provide critical inputs for routing security mechanisms, 
   e.g., generation of route filters by ISPs. This security 
   infrastructure is described in more detail in [ARCH].  

   The most important and distinguishing aspect of the PKI for which 
   this policy was created is that it does not purport to identify an 
   address space holder or AS number holder via the subject name 
   contained in the certificate issued to that entity. Rather, each 
   certificate issued under this policy is intended to enable an entity 
   to assert, in a verifiable fashion, that it is the current holder of 
   an address block or an AS number, based on the current records of 
   the entity responsible for the resources in question. Verification 
   of the assertion is based on two criteria: the ability of the entity 
   to digitally sign data that is verifiable using the public key 
   contained in the corresponding certificate, and validation of that 
   certificate in the context of this PKI. This PKI is designed 
   exclusively for use in support of validation of claims related to 
   address space and AS number holdings, with emphasis on support of 
   routing security mechanisms. Use of the certificates and CRLs 
   managed under this PKI for any other purpose is a violation of this 
   CP, and relying parties should reject such uses. 

   Note: This document is based on the template specified in RFC 3647.  
   A number of sections contained in the template were omitted from 
   this policy because they did not apply to this PKI.  However, we 
   have retained section heading "place holders" for these omitted 
   sections, in order to facilitate comparison with the section 
   numbering scheme employed in that RFC, i.e., the relevant section 
   headings are included and marked [OMITTED]. In the Table of Contents 
   the relevant sections are also marked [OMITTED].

Internet-Draft     Cert Policy for IP Addr/AS# PKI           July 2007 
    

1.1. Overview 

   This PKI is designed to support validation of claims by current 
   holders of IP (v4 and v6) address space, and AS numbers, in 
   accordance with the (current) records of the registries and ISPs 
   that act as CAs in this PKI. The ability to verify such claims is 
   essential to ensuring the unique, unambiguous allocation of these 
   resources, and this, in turn, is an essential underpinning of 
   routing in the public Internet. 

   Internet routing is based on a distributed system of many routers, 
   which are grouped into management domains called Autonomous Systems 
   (ASes). Routing information is exchanged between ASes using Border 
   Gateway Protocol (BGP) [BGP4] UPDATE messages. BGP has proven to be 
   highly vulnerable to a variety of attacks [Murphy], due to the lack 
   of a scalable means of verifying the authenticity and legitimacy of 
   BGP control traffic, e.g., route originations. This PKI, and 
   ancillary, signed data, will support detection of bogus route 
   originations and facilitate routing security enhancements by network 
   operators, e.g., Internet Service Providers (ISPs), e.g., creation 
   of accurate route filters. (Bogus route origination occurs whenever 
   an AS advertises itself as the origin AS for a prefix, without being 
   authorized to do so by the legitimate holder of the prefix.)   

   The proposed security infrastructure consists of three components: a 
   PKI, repositories, and digitally signed objects called route 
   origination authorizations (ROAs). The PKI authoritatively documents 
   the current allocation of address blocks and AS numbers to 
   organizations, as recorded by the organizations that manage such 
   allocations. (For brevity, this document uses the term 
   "organization" to refer to every resource holder, even if the holder 
   is an individual.)  A ROA is a digitally signed object by which an 
   address space holder explicitly authorizes one or more ASes to 
   originate routes to its address space. Repositories provide the 
   means of distributing the PKI data (certificates and CRLs) and ROA 
   data to relying parties. The intent is each network operator uploads 
   its new or updated PKI and ROA data periodically to repositories, 
   e.g., daily. On a similar schedule, each network operator also is 
   expected to download new or updated data uploaded by others. From 
   this data, operators extract authenticated address block origination 
   data, which can be used to validate routing requests or to construct 
   route filters in a more secure fashion than is currently offered via 
   Internet Routing Registries (IRRs). 

   This PKI parallels the existing IP address and AS number allocation 
   hierarchy. These resources are allocated by the Regional Internet 
   Registries (RIRs -- ARIN (North America), RIPE NCC (Europe), APNIC 
   (Asia -Pacific), LACNIC (Latin America and Caribbean), and AFRINIC 
 
 
Seo,Watro,Kong & Kent    Expires January 2008                 [Page 10] 

Internet-Draft     Cert Policy for IP Addr/AS# PKI           July 2007 
    

   (Africa) which act as default trust anchors for the PKI.  In some 
   regions, national (NIRs) form a tier of the hierarchy below the RIRs 
   for address allocation. ISPs and network subscribers form additional 
   tiers below registries. (ISPs who acquire allocations from RIRs or 
   NIRs, and who sub-allocate address space are referred to as Local 
   Internet Registries (LIRs)). 

   The PKI encompasses several types of certificates (see draft-ietf-
   sidr-arch-xx [ARCH] for more details): 

  . CA certificates for each organization allocating address blocks 
     and/or AS numbers, and for each address space (AS number) holder 

  . End entity ("shadow") certificates for organizations to use in 
     verifying ROAs and other (non-certificate/CRL) signed objects 

  . In the future the PKI also may include end entity certificates in 
     support of access control for the repository system  

1.2. Document name and identification 

   The name of this document is "Certificate Policy for the Internet IP 
   Address and AS Number PKI".  

   This policy has been assigned the following OID: 

   id-cp-ipAddr-asNumber 

       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) identified-organization(3) 

               dod(6) internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) 
   cp(14) 2 } 

1.3. PKI participants 

   Note: In a PKI, the term "subscriber" refers to an individual or 
   organization that is a Subject of a certificate issued by a CA. The 
   term is used in this fashion throughout this document, without 
   qualification, and should not be confused with the networking use of 
   the term to refer to an individual or organization that receives 
   service from an ISP.  Thus, in this PKI, the term "subscriber" can 
   refer both to ISPs, which can be subscribers of RIRs, NIRs, and 
   LIRs, and also to organizations that are not ISPs, but which are 
   subscribers of ISPs in the networking sense of the term. Also note 
   that, for brevity, this document always refers to subscribers as 
   organizations, even though some subscribers are individuals. When 
   necessary, the phrase "network subscriber" is used to refer to an 
   organization that receives network services from an ISP.

1.3.1. Certification authorities 

   The organizations that allocate IP addresses (RIRs, NIRs, LIRs) and 
   AS numbers (RIRs and NIRs) act as CAs in this PKI.  

   Non-ISP organizations that hold address space will create and sign 
   ROAs and hence will issue shadow certificates (and may issue other 
   types of EE certificates in the future). Thus they too must act as 
   CAs in this PKI.  

1.3.2. Registration authorities 

   This function will be provided by the CAs listed in Section 1.3.1.  
   The RIRs (and NIRs where applicable) already perform this function 
   and assume responsibility for allocating and tracking the current 
   allocation of address space and AS numbers. LIRs do the same for 
   sub-allocation of address space that they hold.  With regard to 
   allocation of IP address and AS numbers, RIRs et al. establish a 
   formal relationship with an organization and allocate these 
   resources to that organization.  

1.3.3. Subscribers 

   These are the organizations receiving allocations of IP addresses 
   and AS numbers as shown in Figures 1 and 2.  

  . For IP address allocations,  

       o a non-ISP organization can be a subscriber of an ISP, LIR, 
          NIR, or an RIR,  

       o an ISP can be a subscriber of an LIR, NIR, or RIR 

       o an NIR or LIR is a subscriber of an RIR 

  . For AS number allocations, 

       o network subscribers and ISPs/LIRs are subscribers of RIRs and 
          NIRs. 

   Note that any of these organizations may have received allocations 
   from more than one source, over time. This is true even for RIRs, 
   which participate in inter-registry exchanges of address space. This 
   the PKI accommodates such relationships.

Internet-Draft     Cert Policy for IP Addr/AS# PKI           July 2007 
    

1.3.4. Relying parties 

   Entities that need to validate claims of address space and/or AS 
   number current holdings are relying parties.  Thus, for example, 
   entities that make use of address and AS number allocation 
   certificates in support of improved routing security are relying 
   parties. This includes ISPs, multi-homed organizations exchanging 
   BGP traffic with ISPs, and subscribers who have received an 
   allocation of address space from ISP A but want to authorize ISP B 
   to originate routes to this space.  

   To the extent that repositories make use of certificates for access 
   control - checking for authorization to upload certificate, CRL, and 
   ROA update packages, and they too act as relying parties.  

1.3.5. Other participants 

   RIRs (and perhaps NIRs) will operate repositories that hold 
   certificates, CRLs, and other signed objects, e.g., ROAs. 

1.4. Certificate usage 

1.4.1. Appropriate certificate uses 

   The certificates issued under this hierarchy are for authorization 
   in support of validation of claims of current holdings of address 
   space and/or AS numbers, e.g., for routing security. With regard to 
   routing security, an initial goal of this PKI is to allow the holder 
   of a set of address blocks to be able to declare, in a secure 
   fashion, the AS number of each entity that is authorized to 
   originate a route to these addresses, including the context of ISP 
   proxy aggregation.  Additional uses of the PKI, consistent with the 
   basic goal cited above, are also permitted under this policy. 

   Some of the certificates that may be issued under this hierarchy 
   could be used to support operation of this infrastructure, e.g., 
   access control for the repository system. Such uses also are 
   permitted under this policy.  

1.4.2. Prohibited certificate uses 

   Any uses other than those described in Section 1.4.1 are prohibited 
   under this policy. 

1.5. Policy administration 

   [What organization/contact would the WG like to put here?  This 
   section includes the name and mailing address of the organization

   that is responsible for the drafting, registering, maintaining, and 
   updating of this CP.  It also includes the name, electronic mail 
   address, telephone number, and fax number of a contact person.  As 
   an alternative to naming an actual person, the document may name a 
   title or role, an e-mail alias, and other generalized contact 
   information.  We have left "NRO" for now since it would be simplest 
   to have just one organization/contact handle these responsibilities.  
   Another possibility would be to have Section 1.5.1 point to: 

     . IETF RFC Editor for distribution and making the document 
        available. 

     . IETF SIDR Working Group for document drafting, content 
        maintenance and updating. 

   And have Section 1.5.2 have the corresponding contact info, i.e., 
   the email addresses for the IETF RFC Editor and the Working Group 
   Chairs for the SIDR Working Group.]  

1.5.1. Organization administering the document 

   This CP is administered by the ???. 

   [It would be nice to have a single organization responsible for  

1.5.2. Contact person 

   [insert contact info here] 

1.5.3. Person determining CP suitability for the policy 

   Not applicable.  Each organization issuing a certificate in this PKI 
   is attesting to the allocation of resources (IP addresses, AS 
   numbers) to the holder of the private key corresponding to the 
   public key in the certificate. These are the same organizations that 
   perform the allocation hence they are authoritative with respect to 
   the accuracy of this binding.  

1.5.4. CP approval procedures 

   Not applicable. Each organization issuing a certificate in this PKI 
   is attesting to the allocation of resources (IP addresses, AS 
   numbers) to the holder of the private key corresponding to the 
   public key in the certificate. The issuing organization is the same 
   organization as the one that performs the allocation.

1.6. Definitions and acronyms 

BGP -  Border Gateway Protocol.  This is the protocol used in the 
       Internet for propagating the connectivity information used as a 
       basis for inter-domain routing. [BGP4]  

CPS -  Certification Practice Statement. A CPS is a document that 
       specifies the practices that a Certification Authority employs 
       in issuing certificates. 

ISP -  Internet Service Provider. This is an organization managing and 
       selling Internet services to other organizations. 

LIR -  Local Internet Registry. This is an organization, typically a 
       network service provider, that sub-allocates the assignment of 
       IP addresses for a portion of the area covered by a Regional (or 
       National) Registry.   

NIR -  National Internet Registry. This is an organization that manages 
       the assignment of IP address and AS numbers for a portion of the 
       geopolitical area covered by a Regional Registry.  NIRs form an 
       optional second tier in the tree scheme used to manage IP 
       address and AS number allocation.  

RIR -  Regional Internet Registry.  This is an organization that 
       manages the assignment of IP address and AS numbers for a 
       geopolitical area.  At present, there are five RIRs: ARIN (North 
       America), RIPE NCC (Europe), APNIC (Asia -Pacific), LACNIC 
       (Latin America and Caribbean), and AFRINIC (Africa).  

ROA -  Route Origination Authorization.  This is a digitally signed 
       object that identifies a network operator, identified by an AS 
       that is authorized to originate routes to a specified set of 
       address blocks.

2. Publication And Repository Responsibilities 

2.1. Repositories 

   Certificates, CRLs, and ROAs must be made available for downloading 
   by all network operators, to enable them to validate this data for 
   use in support of routing security. This motivates use of a robust 
   repository system. Since this data will be accessed by a very large 
   number of network operators around the world, multiple repositories 
   are required to provide redundancy and for load sharing. As a 
   starting point, a repository will be operated by each RIR. 

2.2. Publication of certification information 

   All CAs will publish certificates via the repository system. 

   Each CA will publish the CRL(s) that it issues by uploading to the 
   repository system. 

   ROAs will be uploaded to the repository system by address space 
   holders, e.g., network subscribers and ISPs/LIRs. 

   An organization may choose to outsource publication of PKI data. 

2.3. Time or frequency of publication 

   A certificate will be published within 24 hours after the CA issues 
   the certificate.   

   Each CA will publish its CRL prior to the nextScheduledUpdate value 
   in the scheduled CRL previously issued by the CA. Within 12 hours of 
   effecting revocation, a CA will publish a CRL with an entry for the 
   revoked certificate. 

   A new ROA will be published before a predecessor ROA has expired, or 
   within 24 hours after an address space holder has changed the set of 
   ASes that is authorized to advertise the address blocks it holds. 

2.4. Access controls on repositories 

      Access to the repository system, for modification of entries, 
   must be controlled to prevent denial of service attacks. All data 
   (certificates, CRLs and ROAs) uploaded to a repository are digitally 
   signed. Updates to the repository system must be validated to ensure 
   that the data being added or replaced is authorized. This document 
   does not define the means by which updates are verified, but use of 
   the PKI itself to validate updates is anticipated.

3. Identification And Authentication 

3.1. Naming 

3.1.1. Types of names 

   Names for RIRs and NIRs will be directory distinguished names, using 
   a subset of the following attributes: C, O, OU, and CN. Names for 
   LIRs/ISPs and subscribers will consist of a single CN attribute with 
   a value generated by the issuer. 

3.1.2. Need for names to be meaningful 

   The Subject name in each certificate must be unique relative to all 
   Subject names certified by an Issuer, but the name does not need to 
   be meaningful. There is no requirement, and no guarantee, that 
   subject names are globally unique in this PKI. The certificates 
   issued under this PKI are used for authorization in support of 
   routing security, not for identification. The intent is to allow the 
   holder of a set of address blocks to be able to announce to the 
   Internet, in a secure fashion, the AS number of each entity that is 
   authorized to originate a route to these addresses. The PKI binds a 
   public key to each address block or AS number.  The name of the 
   holder of the address block or AS number need not be "meaningful" or 
   even accurate. For purposes of routing security, the issuer and 
   subject name in each certificate are not relevant, other than the 
   usual PKI requirements for contextual uniqueness in support of 
   unambiguous certificate path chaining.  

3.1.3. Anonymity or pseudonymity of subscribers 

   Although Subject (and Issuer) names need not be meaningful, and may 
   appear "random," anonymity is not a function of this PKI, and thus 
   no explicit support for this feature is provided. 

3.1.4. Rules for interpreting various name forms 

   None 

3.1.5. Uniqueness of names 

   Each CA certifies Subject names that must be unique among the 
   certificates that it issues. Although it is desirable that these 
   Subject names be unique throughout the PKI, to facilitate 
   certificate path discovery, such uniqueness is neither mandated nor 
   enforced through technical means.

Internet-Draft     Cert Policy for IP Addr/AS# PKI           July 2007 
    

3.1.6. Recognition, authentication, and role of trademarks 

   Because the Subject names are not intended to be meaningful, there 
   is no provision to recognize or authenticate trademarks, service 
   marks, etc. 

3.2. Initial identity validation 

3.2.1. Method to prove possession of private key 

   Each CA operating within the context of this PKI will require each 
   Subject to demonstrate proof-of-possession (PoP) of the private key 
   corresponding to the public key in the certificate, prior to issuing 
   the certificate. The means by which PoP is achieved is determined by 
   each CA and will be declared in the CPS of that CA. 

3.2.2. Authentication of organization identity 

   Each CA operating within the context of this PKI will employ 
   procedures to ensure that each certificate it issues accurately 
   reflects its records with regard to the organization to which the CA 
   has allocated (or sub-allocated) the address space identified in the 
   certificate. The same requirement is imposed on the binding of one 
   or more AS numbers in a certificate to the organization represented 
   by the Subject. The specific procedures employed for this purpose 
   may vary among CAs. Relying parties can expect each CA to employ 
   procedures commensurate with those it already employs as a registry 
   or ISP, in the maintenance of address (and AS number) allocation.  

3.2.3. Authentication of individual identity 

   Each CA operating within the context of this PKI will employ 
   procedures to identify at least one individual as a representative 
   of each organization that is an address space (AS number) holder. 
   This is done in support of issuance, renewal, and revocation of the 
   certificate issued to the organization. The specific means by which 
   each CA authenticates individuals as representatives for an 
   organization may vary, and will be specified in the CPS of the CA. 
   Relying parties can expect each CA to employ procedures commensurate 
   with those it already employs as a registry or ISP, in 
   authenticating individuals as representatives for address space (AS 
   number) holders. Moreover, this authentication is solely for use by 
   each CA in dealing with the organizations to which it allocates (or 
   sub-allocates) address space (or AS numbers), and thus must not be 
   relied upon outside of this CA-subscriber relationship.

3.2.4. Non-verified subscriber information 

   No non-verified subscriber data is included in certificates issued 
   under this certificate policy. 

3.2.5. Validation of authority 

   Each CA operating within the context of this PKI will employ 
   procedures to verify that an individual claiming to represent an 
   organization to which a certificate is issued, is authorized to 
   represent that organization in this context. Relying parties can 
   expect each CA to employ procedures commensurate with those it 
   already employs as a registry or ISP, in authenticating individuals 
   as representatives for address space (AS number) holders. 

3.2.6. Criteria for interoperation 

   This PKI is neither intended nor designed to interoperate with any 
   other PKI.  

3.3. Identification and authentication for re-key requests 

3.3.1. Identification and authentication for routine re-key 

   Each CA operating within the context of this PKI will employ 
   procedures to ensure that an organization requesting a re-key is the 
   legitimate holder of the certificate (and associated address space 
   and AS numbers) to be re-keyed and will require PoP of the private 
   key corresponding to the new public key.  The specific procedures 
   employed for these purposes may vary among CAs. The means by which 
   PoP is achieved is up to each CA and will be declared in the CPS of 
   that CA.  With respect to authentication of the holder of the 
   address space and AS numbers, relying parties can expect each CA to 
   employ procedures commensurate with those it already employs as a 
   registry or ISP, in the maintenance of address (and AS number) 
   allocation.  

   Note: An issuer may choose to require periodic re-keying consistent 
   with contractual agreements with the recipient.   

3.3.2. Identification and authentication for re-key after revocation 

   Each CA operating within the context of this PKI will employ 
   procedures to ensure that an organization requesting a re-key after 
   revocation is the legitimate holder of the certificate (and 
   associated address space and AS numbers) to be re-keyed and will 
   require PoP of the private key corresponding to the new public key.  
   The specific procedures employed for these purposes may vary among

   CAs. The means by which PoP is achieved is up to each CA and will be 
   declared in the certification practice statement of that CA.  With 
   respect to authentication of the holder of the address space and AS 
   numbers, relying parties can expect each CA to employ procedures 
   commensurate with those it already employs as a registry or ISP, in 
   the maintenance of address (and AS number) allocation. Note that 
   there may be different procedures for the case where the legitimate 
   subject still possesses the original private key as opposed to the 
   case when it no longer has access to that key.   

3.4. Identification and authentication for revocation request 

   Each CA operating within the context of this PKI will employ 
   procedures to ensure that an organization requesting revocation is 
   the legitimate holder of the certificate (and associated address 
   space and AS numbers) to be revoked.  The specific procedures 
   employed for these purposes may vary among CAs. Relying parties can 
   expect each CA to employ procedures commensurate with those it 
   already employs as a registry or ISP, in the maintenance of address 
   (and AS number) allocation. 

   Note:  If new IP addresses or AS numbers are being added to an 
   organization's existing allocation, the old certificate need not be 
   revoked. Instead, a new certificate may issued with both the old and 
   the new resources and the old key.  If IP addresses or AS numbers 
   are being removed or if there has been a key compromise, then the 
   old certificate must be revoked (and a re-key must be performed in 
   the event of key compromise).

4. Certificate Life-Cycle Operational Requirements  

4.1. Certificate Application 

4.1.1. Who can submit a certificate application 

   The IP Address and AS Number PKI issues several types of 
   certificates.  Any entity that assigns Internet IP address space or 
   AS numbers should acquire a certificate.  This includes registries 
   and ISPs. Additionally, entities that hold AS numbers or that have 
   address space assignments from a registry, or that are multi-homed, 
   should acquire a certificate under this PKI, even if they do not 
   exchange BGP UPDATEs with ISPs. The (CA) certificates issued to 
   these entities will include one or both of the extensions defined by 
   RFC 3779, X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers, as 
   appropriate.   

   Most of the certificates in this PKI are issued as part of registry 
   and ISP normal business practices, as an adjunct to address space 
   and AS number allocation, and thus a separate specific application 
   to request a certificate usually will not be necessary. 

4.1.2. Enrollment process and responsibilities 

   The enrollment process and procedures are based on the individual 
   polices of RIRs, NIRs, and LIRs/ISPs.  An entity that desires one or 
   more certificates should contact the authorized registry for its 
   geopolitical area, or contact its LIR/ISP if it receives address 
   allocations from an LIR/ISP.  During the initial deployment of this 
   PKI, registries and ISPs should contact their existing network 
   subscribers about obtaining appropriate credentials.   

4.2. Certificate application processing 

   CAs should make use of existing standards for certificate 
   application processing.  Relevant standards include RFC 4210, 
   Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Management 
   Protocol (CMP), RFC 2797, Certificate Management Messages over CMS, 
   and RSA Labs standards PKCS #7 and PKCS #10.  Each CA will define 
   the certificate request/response standards that it employs, via its 
   CPS. 

4.2.1. Performing identification and authentication functions 

   Existing practices employed by registries and ISPs to identify and 
   authenticate organizations form the basis for issuance of 
   certificates to these subscribers.  It is important to note that the 
   IP Address and AS Number PKI is never used to authenticate the 
 
 
Seo,Watro,Kong & Kent    Expires January 2008                 [Page 21] 

Internet-Draft     Cert Policy for IP Addr/AS# PKI           July 2007 
    

   identity of an organization, but rather to bind subscribers to the 
   address blocks and AS numbers they hold.  Because identity is not 
   being vouched for by this PKI, certificate application procedures 
   need not verify legal organization names, etc. 

4.2.2. Approval or rejection of certificate applications 

   Certificate applications will be approved based on the normal 
   business practices of the entity operating the CA, based on the CA's 
   records of address space and AS number holders. Each CA will verify 
   that the requester holds the corresponding private key for the 
   public key that will be bound to the certificate the CA issues to 
   the requestor.   

4.2.3. Time to process certificate applications 

   No stipulation.  Each CA may declare its expected time frame for 
   processing certificate applications as part of its CPS. 

4.3. Certificate issuance 

4.3.1. CA actions during certificate issuance 

   If a CA determines that the request is acceptable, it will issue the 
   corresponding certificate and publish it to the repository. 

4.3.2. Notification to subscriber by the CA of issuance of certificate 

   The CA will notify the subscriber when the certificate is published.  
   The means by which a subscriber is notified is defined by each CA in 
   its CPS. 

4.3.3. Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other entities 
   [OMITTED] 

4.4. Certificate acceptance 

4.4.1. Conduct constituting certificate acceptance 

   Within 24 hours of issuance, the CA will place the certificate in 
   the repository and notify the subscriber.  This will be done without 
   subscriber review and acceptance.  Each CA shall state in its CPS 
   the procedures it follows for publishing of the certificate and 
   notification to the subscriber.

Internet-Draft     Cert Policy for IP Addr/AS# PKI           July 2007 
    

4.4.2. Publication of the certificate by the CA 

   Certificates will be published in the repository system as per the 
   conduct described in 4.4.1. The procedures for publication are 
   defined by each CA in its CPS. 

4.5. Key pair and certificate usage 

   A summary of the use model for the IP Address and AS Number PKI is 
   provided below. 

4.5.1. Subscriber private key and certificate usage 

   Each holder of an address space or AS number allocation will be 
   issued an X.509 certificate using RFC 3779 extensions.  When the 
   subjects of these certificates are LIRs/ISPs or network subscribers, 
   they also shall issue "shadow" certificates to themselves for use in 
   verifying ROAs.  Subjects also will issue subordinate, end-entity 
   certificates to their personnel for repository maintenance. 

4.5.2. Relying party public key and certificate usage 

   The primary relying parties in this PKI are LIRs/ISPs, who will use 
   certificates to verify ROAs, e.g., in support of generating route 
   filters.  Repositories use certificates to verify the authorization 
   of entities to engage in repository maintenance activities, and thus 
   represent a secondary type of relying party. 

4.6. Certificate renewal 

4.6.1. Circumstance for certificate renewal 

   A certificate should be processed for renewal based on its 
   expiration date or a renewal request from the certificate Subject.  
   If the issuing CA initiates the renewal process based on the 
   certificate expiration date, then that CA shall notify the holder in 
   advance of the renewal process.  The validity interval of the new 
   (renewed) certificate should overlap that of the previous 
   certificate, to ensure uninterrupted coverage.  

   Certificate renewal should incorporate the same public key as the 
   previous certificate, unless the private key has been reported as 
   compromised.  If a new key pair is being used, the stipulations of 
   Section 4.7 will apply.

Internet-Draft     Cert Policy for IP Addr/AS# PKI           July 2007 
    

4.6.2. Who may request renewal 

   The certificate holder or the issuing CA may initiate the renewal 
   process.  For example, a certificate holder may request an early 
   renewal if it wishes to change the public key, or if it expects to 
   be unavailable to support the renewal process at the normal 
   expiration cycle. 

4.6.3. Processing certificate renewal requests 

   Renewal processing must verify that the certificate in question has 
   not been revoked.   

4.6.4. Notification of new certificate issuance to subscriber 

   No additional stipulations beyond those of section 4.3.2. 

4.6.5. Conduct constituting acceptance of a renewal certificate 

   No additional stipulations beyond those of section 4.4.1. 

4.6.6. Publication of the renewal certificate by the CA 

   No additional stipulations beyond those of section 4.4.2. 

4.6.7. Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other entities 
   [OMITTED] 

4.7. Certificate re-key 

4.7.1. Circumstance for certificate re-key 

   Re-key of a certificate should be performed only when required, 
   based on: 

   1. knowledge or suspicion of compromise or loss of the associated 
      private key, or  

   2. the expiration of the cryptographic lifetime of the associated 
      key pair  

   The re-key operation can have dramatic consequences, requiring the 
   re-issuance of all certificates issued by a re-keyed entity, so it 
   should be performed only when necessary.  In particular, if a 
   certificate is revoked to replace the RFC 3779 extensions, the 
   replacement certificate can and should incorporate the same public 
   key rather than a new key. 

 
 
Seo,Watro,Kong & Kent    Expires January 2008                 [Page 24] 

Internet-Draft     Cert Policy for IP Addr/AS# PKI           July 2007 
    

   If the re-key is based on a suspected compromise, then the previous 
   certificate must be revoked.  

   Section 5.6 below notes that when a CA signs a certificate, the 
   signing key should have a validity period that exceeds the validity 
   period of the certificate.  This places additional constraints on 
   when a CA should request a re-key. 

4.7.2. Who may request certification of a new public key 

   The holder of the certificate may request a re-key.  In addition, 
   the CA that issued the certificate may initiate a re-key based on a 
   verified compromise report.  Note that care must be taken to verify 
   the authorization of a subscriber to request a re-key when the 
   private key has been reported as compromised.   

4.7.3. Processing certificate re-keying requests 

   The re-key process follows the general procedures of certificate 
   generation as defined in section 4.3. 

4.7.4. Notification of new certificate issuance to subscriber 

   No stipulation beyond the notification process for any new 
   certificate (see section 4.3.2) 

4.7.5. Conduct constituting acceptance of a re-keyed certificate 

   No stipulation beyond the acceptance process for any new certificate 
   (see section 4.4.1) 

4.7.6. Publication of the re-keyed certificate by the CA 

   No stipulation beyond the publication process for any new 
   certificate (see section 4.4.2) 

4.7.7. Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other entities 
   [OMITTED] 

4.8. Certificate modification 

4.8.1. Circumstance for certificate modification 

   Modification of a certificate occurs to implement changes to 
   selected attribute values in a certificate.  In the context of this 
   PKI, the only changes that are accommodated by certificate 
   modification are additions to the address space and/or AS number 
   holdings described by the RFC 3779 extension. 
 
 
Seo,Watro,Kong & Kent    Expires January 2008                 [Page 25] 

Internet-Draft     Cert Policy for IP Addr/AS# PKI           July 2007 
    

   When previously allocated address space or AS numbers are removed 
   from a certificate, then the old certificate is revoked and a new 
   certificate is issued.  

   When a certificate modification is approved, a new certificate is 
   issued.  The new certificate will contain the same public key and 
   the same expiration date as the original certificate, but with the 
   incidental information corrected and/or the address space and AS 
   allocations expanded.  Revocation of the previous certificate is not 
   required. 

4.8.2. Who may request certificate modification 

   The certificate holder or issuer may initiate the certificate 
   modification process.   

4.8.3. Processing certificate modification requests 

   The CA must determine that the requested modification is appropriate 
   and the procedures for the issuance of a new certificate are 
   followed. 

4.8.4. Notification of new certificate issuance to subscriber 

   No stipulation beyond the notification process for any new 
   certificate (see section 4.3.2) 

4.8.5. Conduct constituting acceptance of modified certificate 

   No stipulation beyond the acceptance process for any new certificate 
   (see section 4.4.1). 

4.8.6. Publication of the modified certificate by the CA 

   No stipulation beyond the publication process for any new 
   certificate (see section 4.4.2). 

4.8.7. Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other entities 
   [OMITTED] 

4.9. Certificate revocation and suspension 

4.9.1. Circumstances for revocation 

   Certificates can be revoked for several reasons.  Either the issuer 
   or subject may choose to end the relationship expressed in the 
   certificate, thus creating cause to revoke the certificate.  A 
   certificate also may be revoked due to loss or compromise of the 
 
 
Seo,Watro,Kong & Kent    Expires January 2008                 [Page 26] 

Internet-Draft     Cert Policy for IP Addr/AS# PKI           July 2007 
    

   private key corresponding to the public key in the certificate.  
   Finally, a certificate may be revoked in order to invalidate data 
   signed by that certificate.  For example, if the private key 
   associated with a shadow certificate has been used to sign a ROA, 
   then that shadow certificate can be revoked to effect revocation of 
   the ROA. 

4.9.2. Who can request revocation 

   The certificate holder or issuer may request a revocation. 

4.9.3. Procedure for revocation request 

   A certificate holder must submit a request to the certificate issuer 
   for a revocation.  A certificate issuer must notify the certificate 
   holder when revoking a certificate, however this notification 
   requirement is satisfied by publication of a CRL by the issuer. 

4.9.4. Revocation request grace period 

   A subscriber should request revocation as soon as possible after the 
   need for revocation has been identified.  There is no specified 
   grace period for the subscriber in this process. 

4.9.5. Time within which CA must process the revocation request 

   No stipulation. Each CA is free to specify its expected revocation 
   processing time in its CPS. 

4.9.6. Revocation checking requirement for relying parties 

   A relying party is responsible for acquiring and checking the most 
   recent, scheduled CRL from the issuer of the certificate, whenever 
   the relying party validates a certificate. 

4.9.7. CRL issuance frequency  

   As indicated in section 2.3, it is expected that CAs will publish 
   CRLs approximately every 24 hours, although the specific CRL 
   issuance frequency is determine by each CA.  Each CRL carries a 
   nextScheduledUpdate value and a new CRL must be published at or 
   before that time.  A CA must set the nextScheduledUpdate value when 
   it issues a CRL, to signal when the next scheduled CRL will be 
   issued.

4.9.8. Maximum latency for CRLs  

   It is expected that a CRL will be posted to the repository system 
   with minimal delay after generation.

   This PKI does not make use of OCSP or SCVP, because it is 
   anticipated that the primary relying parties (ISPs) will acquire and 
   validate certificates for all participating resource holders on a 
   daily basis. These protocols are not designed for such large-scale, 
   bulk certificate status checking. Instead, retrieval of all changed 
   or new certificates and CRLs on a daily basis is the anticipated 
   mode of certificate status verification.

   have a validity period that is at least as long as that of the 
   certificate being signed.  This means that a CA must create a new 
   signature key pair, and acquire a new certificate containing the 
   public key of the pair, well in advance of the scheduled change of 
   the current signature key pair.

   In this PKI, each CA is authoritative for a specified range of IP 
   addresses and a specified set of AS numbers.  If an organization 
   acting as a CA in this PKI terminates operation without identifying 
   a replacement, then a portion of the address space and AS numbers 
   will need to be managed without support for validating 
   authorizations until a new CA is brought on-line.

6. Technical Security Controls 

   The organizations that allocate IP addresses and AS numbers to 
   subscribers are authoritative for these allocations.  This PKI is 
   designed to enable LIRs/ISPs and network subscribers to demonstrate 
   that they are the holders of the resources that have been allocated 
   to them.  Accordingly, the security controls used by CAs and 
   subscribers for this PKI need only to be as secure as those that 
   apply to the procedures for administering the allocation of IP 
   address space and AS number data by the extant organizations. 
   Details of each CA's security controls are described in the CPS 
   issued by the CA. 

6.1. Key pair generation and installation 

6.1.1. Key pair generation 

   In most instances, public-key pairs will be generated by the 
   subject, i.e., the organization receiving the allocation of address 
   space or AS numbers.  However, some CAs may offer to generate key 
   pairs on behalf of their subjects at the request of the subjects, 
   e.g., to accommodate subscribers who do not have the ability to 
   perform key generation in a secure fashion. Since the keys used in 
   this PKI are not for non-repudiation purposes, generation of key 
   pairs by CAs does not inherently undermine the security of the PKI. 
   Each CA will describe its key pair generation procedures in its CPS. 

6.1.2. Private key delivery to subscriber 

   If a CA provides key pair generation services for subscribers, its 
   CPS will describe the means by which private keys are delivered to 
   subscribers in a secure fashion.  

6.1.3. Public key delivery to certificate issuer 

   Each CA operating within the context of this PKI defines procedures 
   whereby a subscriber requests IP address space (and/or AS numbers), 
   authenticates itself, pays for the resources, etc. The CPS of each 
   CA will describe how these procedures are extended to support 
   certificate issuance. The security of the procedures used by a 
   subject to deliver its public key to a CA need only be commensurate 
   with the security of the procedures already employed for management 
   of the IP address space and AS numbers. 

6.1.4. CA public key delivery to relying parties 

   CA public keys for all entities other than RIRs are contained in 
   certificates issued by other CAs.  These certificates plus

Internet-Draft     Cert Policy for IP Addr/AS# PKI           July 2007 
    

   certificates used to represent inter-RIR transfers of address space 
   or AS numbers will be published via a repository system. Relying 
   parties will download these certificates from the repositories. 
   Public key values and associated data for the default trust anchors 
   (RIRs) will be distributed out of band, e.g., embedded in path 
   validation software that will be made available to the Internet 
   community.  

6.1.5. Key sizes 

   For RIR certificates, the RSA key size will be 2048 bits. For NIR, 
   LIR/ISP, and non-ISP subscriber certificates, the RSA keys will be 
   either 2048 or 1024 bits.   

6.1.6. Public key parameters generation and quality checking 

   The RSA algorithm [RSA] is used in this PKI with the public exponent 
   (e) F4 (65,537). Each subscriber is responsible for performing 
   checks on the quality of its key pair. CAs are not responsible for 
   performing such checks for subscribers. 

6.1.7. Key usage purposes (as per X.509 v3 key usage field) 

   The Key usage extension bit values shall be consistent with RFC 
   3280. For CA certificates, the keyCertSign and cRLSign bits shall be 
   set TRUE. All other bits (including digitalSignature) shall be set 
   FALSE, and the extension shall be marked critical. End entity 
   certificates in this PKI may include this extension, with 
   appropriate bit values, as per RFC 3280, but such inclusion is not 
   required. 

6.2. Private Key Protection and Cryptographic Module Engineering 
   Controls 

6.2.1. Cryptographic module standards and controls 

   The cryptographic module standards and controls employed by each CA 
   will be described in the CPS issued by that CA.  

6.2.2. Private key (n out of m) multi-person control 

   Some CAs, e.g., registry CAs, may employ multi-person controls to 
   constrain access to their private keys, but this is not a 
   requirement for all CAs in the PKI. The CPS for a CA will describe 
   any multi-person controls it employs.

6.2.3. Private key escrow 

   No private key escrow procedures are required for this PKI. 

6.2.4. Private key backup 

   Because of the adverse operational implications associated with the 
   loss of use of a CA private key in the PKI, each CA should employ a 
   secure means to backup its private keys. The details of the 
   procedures for backing up a CA's private key will be described in 
   the CPS issued by the CA.

6.2.9. Method of deactivating private key [OMITTED] 

6.2.10. Method of destroying private key [OMITTED] 

6.2.11. Cryptographic Module Rating [OMITTED] 

6.3. Other aspects of key pair management 

6.3.1. Public key archival 

   Because this PKI does not support non-repudiation, there is no need 
   to archive public keys. 

6.3.2. Certificate operational periods and key pair usage periods 

   The RIR and accepat key pairs and certificates should have long 
   validity intervals, e.g., 10 years, to minimize the disruption 
   caused by key changeover for top tier CAs. LIR/ISP and subscriber 
   certificates typically will have validity periods commensurate with 
   the duration of service agreements. The validity periods will be 
   chosen by the issuing CA and described in its CPS.

6.6.1. System development controls 

   The CPS for each CA will document any system development controls 
   required by that CA, if applicable. 

6.6.2. Security management controls 

   The security for the software and equipment used for this PKI shall 
   be commensurate with that used for the systems used by the CAs for 
   managing and allocating IP address and AS number resources.  

6.6.3. Life cycle security controls 

   Equipment (hardware and software) used for this PKI shall be 
   procured, installed, maintained, and updated in a fashion 
   commensurate with the way in which equipment for the management and 
   allocation of IP address space and AS numbers is handled.   

6.7. Network security controls 

   Each CA shall employ network security controls for CA operation 
   commensurate with the protection it employs for the computers used 
   for managing allocation of IP addresses and AS numbers. 

6.8. Time-stamping 

   The PKI in question does not make use of time stamping.

8. Compliance Audit And Other Assessments 

   The Certificate Policy for a typical PKI defines the criteria 
   against which prospective CAs are evaluated and establishes 
   requirements that they must meet. In this PKI, the CAs are already 
   authoritative for the management of IP address space and AS numbers, 
   and the PKI simply supports verification of the allocation if these 
   resources to subscribers. Accordingly, whatever audit and other 
   assessments are already used to ensure the security of the 
   administration of IP addresses and AS numbers is sufficient for this 
   PKI.

9. Other Business And Legal Matters 

   As noted throughout this certificate policy, the organizations 
   managing the allocation of IP addresses and AS numbers are 
   authoritative in their roles as managers of this data.  They will 
   operate this PKI to allow the holders of address space and AS number 
   allocations to generate digitally signed data that attests to these 
   allocations, and to the authorization of LIRs/ISPs to originate 
   routes for address blocks (via ROAs). Therefore, the manner in which 
   the organizations in question manage their business and legal 
   matters for this PKI should be commensurate with the way in which 
   they already manage business and legal matters in their existing 
   roles. The topics listed below may be covered in the CPS issued by 
   each CA. Not every CA may choose to address all of these topics.  

9.1. Fees

10. Security Considerations 

   According to X.509, a certificate policy (CP) is "a named set of 
   rules that indicates the applicability of a certificate to a 
   particular community and/or class of applications with common 
   security requirements."  A CP may be used by a relying party to help 
   in deciding whether a certificate, and the binding therein, are 
   sufficiently trustworthy and otherwise appropriate for a particular 
   application. This document describes the CP for the Internet Address 
   and AS Number PKI.  There are separate documents (Certification 
   Practice Statements (CPS's) that cover the factors that determine 
   the degree to which a relying party can trust the binding embodied 
   in a certificate. The degree to which such a binding can be trusted 
   depends on several factors, e.g., the practices followed by the 
   certification authority (CA) in authenticating the subject; the CA's 
   operating policy, procedures, and technical security controls, 
   including the scope of the subscriber's responsibilities (for 
   example, in protecting the private key), and the stated 
   responsibilities and liability terms and conditions of the CA (for 
   example, warranties, disclaimers of warranties, and limitations of 
   liability).
