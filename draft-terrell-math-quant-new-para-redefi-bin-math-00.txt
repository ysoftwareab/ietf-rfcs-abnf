Abstract

    
    
    This paper provides the Mathematics for the New Paradigm Defining
    the Binary System. Furthermore, while the Mathematical foundation
    and Logical justification, which established the New Structure for
    the BINARY SYSTEM, were derived from The Mathematics of
    Quantification. The Mathematics itself, which is used in the New
    Binary System however, while providing the viable justification and
    the logical reasons that supports the change for the New Binary Model,
    is not quite so new. In fact, it can be said that the Mathematics of
    Quantification sustains a Cascading Effect upon the Entire Mathematical
    Field. But, the Mathematics for the New Binary System has a Historical
    Foundation, which dates to the beginnings of Mathematics itself.

Introduction: The Discourse, which Quells the Arguments in Opposition



    
    It is said: "Arrogance is the Defense using Words, A Pretense, which
    is the True Face of Ignorance, Hiding Behind the Mask Intellectual
    Deception."
    
    Whatever the case may, or may not be, I truly attempted without any
    doubts, to contact the entire World, and present to everyone, the Gift
    from the Beginnings of the Mathematics of Quantification. However,
    only one person responded, this time, and their presentation was an
    opposition, one that bespeaks of Arrogance...not the anticipated
    response from a professional Mathematician or Logician:


    "Dear Mr. Terrell, 
 
     You are, as anybody else, free to prefer a nonstandard interpretation
     (or, rather, enumeration) of the binary system; there is no "true
     interpretation", and the ways to map integers to binary numbers is
     uncountable (as Cantor proved). 
 
     Nonetheless, the standard interpretation which you have chosen to attack
     is distinguished by one property which no other enumeration has: a
     simple arithmetic well-suited for the computers of our age. Addition,
     for example, can in the binary number system simply done as in the
     decimal system, except of course, that adding 1 to 1 yields 10, at any
     particular place. If you now take two numbers, say 9 and 5, translate
     them to their binary representations, and add them according to the rule
     mentioned:



 
 
                                00001001 <- 9 
                                00000101 <- 5 
                                ++++++++====== 
                                00001110 -> 14 
 



    and retranslate into the decimal system, you get 14. That means, addition
    in the binary system and in the decimal system are _isomorphic_, the same
    easy operation yields the same (correct) result in both number systems. 
 
    This is, in short, the reason why the standard interpretation of binary
    numbers is the one which computer scientists prefer, as it is easy to
    implement in electronic devices and hence forms the basis for modern-day
    computer chips. 



E Terrell                                                      [Page 4]

Quantification, New Paradigm, Re-Defines Binary Math   February 22, 2002




    Your interpretation of the binary numbers, to the contrary, does not have
    an arithmetic which is simple, as the zero digit can not function as
    neutral element anymore. It is therefore much clumsier to deal with. 
 
    Mathematicians do not accept claims at truth of any possible,
    non-selfcontradictory (= consistent) mathematical system. The times when
    mathematicians were thinking that their axiomatic systems, such as Euclid's
    axiomatics of geometry, were obvious truths and the only possible systems,
    they went away with the discovery of the consistency of non-Euclidean
    geometries in the early nineteenth century. Later on, logicians proved that
    mathematical truth is indeed equivalent to mathematical consistency. 
 
    To claim that there is a logical fault with the standard binary number
    system, you would have to derive a contradiction. This would have the
    interesting side effect of destroying the whole of current mathematics and
    rendering current computers unusable. I believe that you are right in your
    IETF draft which just expired, insofar as "no one has, or is capable" of
    deriving such a contradiction. That you make an exception for yourself, is,
    in my humble opinion, a sad indication of severe megalomania. I can only
    wish you to be healed of it and be able to spare your limited energies for
    endeavors not so futile as this one, though my experience with cases such
    as yours leaves me with little hope. 
 
    Sincerely yours, 
    Aleksandar Perovic 
 
    Chief Executive Administrator 
    The Electronic Library of Mathematics" 


    My work, as a Scientist and a Researcher, speaks for itself, and my
    accomplishments ascribes the definition of me and my abilities, which
    defies the boundaries imposed by the definitions of the words used in
    the many languages denoting Mankind∆s diversity. It is sad though, because
    I am spending a great deal of time, clarifying Elementary Concepts, once
    thought to be Well Understood by the Professionals who populate the Field
    of Study for which this Draft represents. And while, I advocate the
    necessity regarding the priority for Studying the Historical Documents
    comprising the intended Area of Research, prior to any Research
    Undertaking. It should be understood however, my advocacy sustains a
    Revolution against Dogma, and supports the belief that; 'Regardless of
    the Epitome granted by the Historical Documentation, to any individual,
    belief or acceptance of their work remains challenge, which is reserved
    for continued Analysis, and the reflection upon the Classical Foundation
    from which the Laws, Rules, and Logic that support their work, were
    derived.' Needless to say, since Mankind is Not GOD, I stand Poised in
    the Ready, and will challenge his perception or interpretation for Reality,
    regardless of the underlining subject matter, or the intent his
    presentation is said to represent.  
      
    Notwithstanding my personal beliefs however, we can make use of the
    limited argument provided by 'Mr. Perovic', and derive not only the
    supporting Mathematics for the New Binary System, but provide the
    "...contradiction", which he claims is necessary to prove that the

Quantification, New Paradigm, Re-Defines Binary Math   February 22, 2002




    Modern Interpretation of the Method for Enumerating in the Binary
    System is wrong. Furthermore, what's nice about speaking with Mr. Perovic,
    is that, he reveals the Contradiction, unknowing to himself, that we
    need, when he said: 



    "Nonetheless, the standard interpretation which you have chosen to attack
     is distinguished by one property which no other enumeration has: a
     simple arithmetic well-suited for the computers of our age. Addition,
     for example, can in the binary number system simply done as in the
     decimal system, except of course, that adding 1 to 1 yields 10, at any
     particular place." 



    Can you see the Foundation, which would allow the presentation of the
    Contradiction? In other words, you can not perform the operation of
    addition on the equation "1 + 1", because this would equate to "10". But!
    Isn't this a Numbering System, that is Governed by the Elementary Laws
    of Mathematics and Logical reasoning, which must ultimately obey the Laws
    from the Field Postulates and Set Theory? Addition, when dealing with the
    Binary System, should it be considered different in Arithmetic or Logical
    consistency from that of the Unary System, which is now the Positive
    Integers' graphical depiction of a Numerical? And what about the overall
    Arithmetic Operations pertaining to Mathematics itself, isn't this wrong
    there too? Well...If it is, then what was Gregor Cantor actually saying?
    Perhaps, what he was actually saying, was that; 'If you are wrong, and you
    are consistently wrong in what you are saying or doing, then you can make
    it looks correct, because it is Consistent.' Nevertheless, in any case, the
    Argument has been made, and a gradual development of the foundation
    supporting the New Paradigm for the Binary Mathematics will be set forth
    in the succeeding chapters.

Chapter I: Another look at the New Binary Paradigm




    To establish the foundation, which would ultimately lead to the Final
    conclusion supporting the New Paradigm for the Binary System, and the
    "Contradiction", that would provide the necessary proof that the Modern
    Foundation is wrong. I must first provide a Table(s) Listing the relative
    Numbering Systems, for comparison, and then reiterate parts of the Proof,
    which would allow the derivation of the New Paradigm for the Binary System.

    The examination of TABLE 1A, coupled of the Elementary Operations for
    Addition in Binary Mathematics, the Laws from the Field Postulates, 
    and Set Theory, Cleary it can be seen that the Operation of Addition in
    the equation "1 + 1 = 10" is the "Contradiction", which is Not Violated
    Under the New Paradigm for the Binary System. And while, I could also
    say that the Relationship between Columns '2' and '4' has been established
    has being Logically valid under the Rules and Laws, which govern the Field
    Postulates and Set Theory, it would be too taxing of a demand, that would
    require the knowledge of the Mathematics of Quantification. And in this
    case, it is totally unnecessary, because the Laws from Elementary
    Mathematics, already has been shown to suffice for the establishment of
    the "Proof by Contradiction" Argument required by 'Mr. Perovic' response
    to the initial proof of the foundation that established the this New
    Paradigm for the Binary System. 

    In other words, 'Mr. Perovic' stated that the flaw in the Modern Method for
    Enumerating using Binary Notation, resulted from an Exception to the
    Mathematical Law Governing the Operation of Addition. That is, he stated;
    "...except of course, that adding 1 to 1 yields 10", which is the Binary
    Notation that represents, or equals the Integer '3'. Furthermore, while the
    Argument can easily be closed, just from this little example, and of course,
    a comparison between Columns '2' and '4' from Table 1A, that would clearly
    establish the Method for Elementary Arithmetic Operations for this New
    Binary System...Still many would complain, regarding the missing rigor from
    the Logical Argument, which would unquestionably rule out any further
    opposition.

    However, prior to beginning the development of the foundation, which would
    allow for the derivation of the Methods for the Elementary Arithmetic
    Operations, I must first reiterate the conclusions supporting the proof
    that established the Foundation for the New Model representing the Binary
    System.





    "...However, prior to any forthright Construction of Table Ic, following
    in sequence from Tables I, Ia, and Ib. It would facilitate the analysis of
    the logical argument, if we first reiterate the requirements that were
    logically developed, that established the foundational definitions and
    requirements, which would be the mandate for any Binary System to exist.

                              Binary Principles 


           1. Binary; Consisting of 2 Things, Elements, or Members.

           2. Zero and the Null Set are implied by the same definition

           3. Zero; Having no Quantity, Size, Members, or elements;
              representing a State of Condition of Nothingness.

           4. Binary Set; Consisting of 2 and only 2, Elements or Members.

           5. Union of Set; Combining the Elements or Members of 2 or more
              Sets, resulting in 1 Set containing the total, which represents
              the combined total of the Members from the initial Sets.

           6. 'Equality': A Relationship, which provides a means to establish
              an Identity between 2 or more Objects being compared.

           7. Binary Zero is represented by '00', since it is not empty, it
              is not equal to either the Zero Integer or the Null Set.




    Now if you are satisfied with the list of Principles derived from, and
    associated with the Binary System, with the exception of 7. We can
    construct Table Ic, which represents another view for the Modern Method
    of Binary Enumeration.

    Notice that Table Ic maintains the 'One-to-One' validity as Table IIa.
    However, as with Tables I and II, their differences remain the same. In
    fact, any comparison with Table IIa maintains the same validity, except
    for their different starting points. In other words, Table Ic and Table
    IIa are 2 distinct Numbering Systems, that use the Binary Notation in a
    'One-to-One Pairing' with the Integers to define and establish equality.  

    "Do we now have 2 Binary Systems, establishing a slightly different, and
    yet, equal relationship with the Set of Integers? I mean, what do we have
    here? Is it possible to have 2 distinct Binary Systems, whose difference
    represents a different 'One-to-One Pairing' with the Integers? Or are we
    to try once again, and decide, which one of the two Numbering Systems
    actually represents a True Binary System?"

    Following the same investigative analysis used in earlier chapters, we can
    depict this difference graphically. That is, if we were now to extrapolate
    from the respective Binary Notations, as it would be given by the Integers'
    additive method of progression, which produces the counting series using
    successive additions of 1. We could then generate a number line, denoting
    a 'One-to-One Mapping' with the Integers that would more accurately depict
    these noted distinctions. Given respectively by figures 3 and 4, we have:

  

                      Fig 3.

       1 2 3 4  = The Count of Total Number
      -+-+-+-+     of Members in the Set

    What the bottom row of numbers actually represents, is the total number of
    combinations, which will be generated from the Binary Set, {0,1}. However,
    these combinations are used in a way similar to the way the '1' is used in
    the Integers, which increments from right to left using and changing only
    the ' 0 or 1' notations from the Binary Set to generate a series of Binary
    Numbers. In other words, they generate a series governed by the operation
    of addition. That is, given respectively by figures 5 and 6, we have:





                        Fig 5.

                   {01}, {10}, {11}
                     2     3     4




                        Fig 6.

                  1     2     3     4







    Well, how do you begin your count? I mean, if there are 5 objects to be
    counted, would your count start with 'Zero' or 'One'? Clearly, the Set of
    Integers from which the Counting Numbers were derived, was only a graphical
    depiction, to be used in such a way, as to render a picture of the Number
    to be represented, which used one or more of these members to achieve the
    desired result. And nothing more. In other words, the Set of Integers or
    Whole Numbers, maintains the additional distinction of being a short-hand
    representation for the Operation of Addition, from which the sequence of
    Numbers is derived from the Unary Set {1}.

    Furthermore, I am sure you observed from figure 5, that the equating of
    Binary Zero to the Integer Zero reduced the number of combinations
    resulting from the Binary Set. Which is actually the cause which produces
    the SHIFT in the 'One-to-One Pairing' with the Integers. I mean, the
    assignment of the Beginning Point for any Numbering Systems is very
    important, because it sets the starting point that will be used for
    counting.

    Moreover, further analysis of the resulting Combinations derived from both
    of the respective Binary Sets, using Tables Ic and IIa. Clearly shows the
    equality existing between each of these Sets, which is derived from the
    'One-to-One Pairing' equating the Points on the Number Line, denoting the
    Integers, with the Binary Notations they respectively represent. If
    however, we mapped the results indicated by figures 5 and 6, using the
    respective mappings given by figures 3 and 4, we would establish the
    necessary proof for concluding, that the method derived for Counting using
    the Modern Interpretation is wrong. In other words, any 'One-to-One
    Mapping' with the Integers and the Combinations resulting from figures 5
    and 6, would clearly show that the missing Set, given by the Combination
    {00}, would result in a inaccurate mapping denoting an Inequality with
    the Sequence of Counting Numbers derived from the Set of Integers; that is,
    the Set of Counting Numbers denoted by: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}. In which
    case, the Universal Set " I ", for the Integers, would equal the Set
    denoted by:

               

                                 Fig 7.

      { {...-10,...-5,-4,-3,-2,-1}  {0}  {1,2,3,4,5,...,10} }


    Where its number line mapping is given by:



                                  Fig 8.

     -10 + -9 ... -5 +... -2 + -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 ... 5 +... + 10

    Nevertheless, the System of counting presently being used is a UNARY
    System, from which the sequence of Counting begins with the Number '1',
    and continues its progression using successive additions of the Number
    '1' to derive the next or succeeding numbers. And while it maybe called
    or labeled as being something different (i.e. Decimal System), it is
    nevertheless Unary. Furthermore, while Zero, '0', is used in every
    Numbering System (denoting its' universal application), it is not itself,
    a Number. It is only a symbolic notation, which represents emptiness, or
    lack of an Object to which it refers. Hence, Binary by definition, means
    '2', and nothing more. Therefore, when considering the construction of any
    Numbering System that employs or uses Binary Notation, we must first
    realize that the first '4' numbers are derived from the Total Number of
    Possible Unique Combinations, which are related to and derived from, the
    Sequenced Numbers or Elements depicted as being Members of the Binary Set.
    And further conclude, that all other succeeding Binary Numbers are derived
    from these Combinations. In which case, since the Binary Set equals {0,1},
    the total number of Unique Combinations equals the set {00, 01, 10, 11},
    which respectively represents the first '4' Binary Numbers whose mapping
    with the Set of Integers starts with the Number '1'.


    Hence, the Correct Method for Enumeration in the Binary System is given
    by the Results displayed in Table IIa, and the Modern Interpretation for
    the Method of Enumeration in the Binary System is clearly wrong. But still,
    both methods clearly represent a Binary System. Notwithstanding however,
    while the conclusions derived with respect to each of these Systems remains
    unquestionably valid. It does not stop, nor prevent any decision regarding
    choice. In other words, for whatever reason, right or wrong, for now at
    least, it does not matter which Binary System is used. Because other than
    myself, no one has, or is capable of completing the necessary studies
    indicating some out come producing a harm, resulting from the effects for
    choosing the wrong System."

Chapter II: Developing the Mathematical Foundation for Arithmetic Operations




    First and foremost, it should be pointed out, that while the Numbers in
    Binary Notation, as represented in Column '2' from Table 1A, are
    derived from the total number of Unique Combinations, which equals the set
    {00, 01, 10, 11}, and that they respectively represent the first '4'
    Binary Numbers whose mapping with the Set of Integers starts with the
    Number '1'. Furthermore, any comparison of Columns '2' and '4', also reveals
    that they are 'Incremented' or 'De-Incremented' using the same methods
    as those governing the Unary Set. That is, while the sequence of Counting
    does not begin with the Number '1', it uses Number '1' to derive a
    progression, which uses successive additions of the Number '1' to derive
    the next, and the succeeding numbers in Binary Notation. What this
    actually means, or implies, is that, by definition, there exist only '4'
    Members or Numbers in the 'BINARY SET'...All else, is a Synthetic Creation,
    which facilitates enumeration beyond a count of '4'. In which case, the
    'Unary Set' contains only '1' Member, and all other numerals results from
    some combination, which builds upon, and are related to, the number '1'.    

    Furthermore, while this process is clearly depicted in Table 1A, any
    questions concerning the validity of such an Operation, are easily
    quelled, using the 'Axioms for Equality', which are derived from the Laws
    governing the Basic Arithmetic Operations of Elementary Mathematics. And
    in this particular case, the Elementary Mathematical Law of Governance is
    the 'Substitution Law for Equality, which states; "If A = B, then A may be
    replaced by B, an B by A, in any Mathematical Statement without altering
    the Truth or Falsity of the statement." What this means, and is represented
    in Table 1A, is that, since {00} = {1}, then {00} may be replaced by {1},
    and {1} by {00}, in any Mathematical Statement without changing or altering
    the value of the Mathematical Statement itself.  

    Nevertheless, I will not extend the argument beyond the Elementary
    Operations, which deal specifically with Addition and Subtraction, because
    these operations would suffice in not only establishing the necessary proof
    by Contradiction, but clearly represents the ease and elegance of the
    Mathematical Operations, which represents the New Paradigm for the Binary
    Set. Not to mention, that it would be redundant to proceed any further,
    because the Modern Interpretation for Representing the Operation of
    Addition, in the Current Binary Set Notation, Fail the TEST, when one
    attempts to solve the Equation "1 + 1 = 10"...Which is valid enough, as
    the proof by contradiction, especially since it does not yield an equivalent
    integer representation. In other words, it does not represent the integer
    '3'.   

    Nonetheless, if you are satisfied, and I sincerely hope that you are, we
    can, by example and comparison using Table 1A, show examples of Addition
    and Subtraction using the New Paradigm, which represents the Real Binary
    System.

    Please note, when observing Table 1A, specifically Column '2', you should
    notice that the Progression beyond the Number represented by '00',
    'Increments' the next Number by the same amount shown in Column '4',
    which represent the Number, or Integer, '1' under Column '3'. Where by, the
    Operation of Addition is given in Table 2A, and the Operation of
    Subtraction is shown in Table 3A:

    4. 11 + 1 = 100                4 + 1 = 5                    5

    5. 100 + 1 = 101               5 + 1 = 6                    6

    8. 111 - 1 = 110               8 - 1 = 7                    7 












    Clearly, Tables 2A and 3A provides an adequate representation for the
    Elementary Mathematical Operations of Addition and Subtraction, which can
    be easily verified using Table 1A, and hence, quells all further doubts
    about the Logic, and or Mathematical Operations that encompass the New
    Paradigm representing the Binary System. Furthermore, it can be easily
    shown, that the even more Complicated Mathematical Operations representing
    Multiplication and Division would follow the same presentation. In other
    words, the conclusion representing the foundation, which Established this
    New Paradigm for the Binary System, remain unquestionably valid. And Gregor
    Cantor was very wrong...

Chapter III: The Mathematics of Quantification; Spectacles for Viewing
                 the Mathematical Possibilities 


    Nevertheless, whether or not you are familiar with Quantification, it
    should be clear, since its mention, The power of the Mathematics of
    Quantification is indeed daunting, and it should reign over the Entire
    Mathematical Field forever, without question. In fact, I am currently
    working on more of its promises, which includes; 



                    1.  Establishing the  foundation for Ternary Logic


                    2.  Establishing the Foundation for Multi-Variable Logic


                    3.  The Correction of the Errors in the Logic and
                        Mathematics in Fuzzy Logic


    And while it should be understood, I definitely have my work cut out for
    me, and it should be equally clear that time does not always permit an
    explanation of the Elementary Concepts, which should be understood.

    Notwithstanding, the joys I derive from my work in the field of
    Mathematics, my actual objective is indeed the Natural Sciences, and
    perhaps the Engineering Sciences as well. But clearly, it is doubtful,
    that any of these works will every find as their home, the postings of
    the IETF's Web Page. Needless to say, they would indeed be well beyond
    the scope of the audience, who frequencies Internet-Drafts Web Page for the
    latest information regarding the standards governing Computer Technology.   

    And for this, I sincerely apologize.
