         Fast Convergence Extension for ISATAP Router Discovery

              draft-templin-ngtrans-isatapext-00.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies an optional extension to the Intra-Site
   Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol [ISATAP] to provide fast
   convergence (i.e., fast router discovery). ISATAP is a transition
   mechanism that enables incremental deployment of IPv6 by treating the
   site's IPv4 infrastructure as a Non-Broadcast Multiple Access (NBMA)
   link layer. The router discovery mechanisms proposed by ISATAP are
   well suited for allowing hosts to discover routers on fixed networks,
   i.e, networks with relatively static links and nodes. But, their slow
   periodic polling properties do not support timely router discovery
   for nodes in dynamic networks, e.g., wireless networks in which
   mobile nodes "visit" only for brief periods of time. The optional
   extension proposed by this draft may be useful for ISATAP deployments
   that require fast convergence.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies an optional extension for [ISATAP] that sup-
   ports fast convergence (i.e, fast discovery of on-link routers). The
   extension employs a subset of the multicast mechanisms specified by
   [6OVER4] to augment the NBMA mechanisms specified by [ISATAP].


2.  Applicability Statement


     - provides fast convergence for [ISATAP] deployments on
       dynamic networks, e.g., in a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network [MANET]

     - may provide benefits for fixed networks, e.g., Router
       Advertisement consistency verification.

     - augments (but does not replace) the mechanisms specified
       in [ISATAP]

     - best suited for networks with full/partial deployment
       of IPv4 multicast


3.  Terminology

   The terminology of [IPv6] and [ISATAP] apply to this document. The
   following additional term is defined:

   6OVER4/ISATAP pseudo-interface:
     a virtual attachment to an ISATAP interface that maps IPv6 multicast
     to IPv4 multicast addresses exactly as specified in [6OVER4,6]


4.  Transmission of IPv6 Packets on 6OVER4/ISATAP Pseudo Interfaces

   Nodes in networks that deploy [ISATAP] MAY OPTIONALLY attach a
   6OVER4/ISATAP pseudo-interface to any of their ISATAP interfaces. The
   6OVER4/ISATAP pseudo-interface uses IPv6 link-local address of the
   attaching ISATAP interface and the specification for transmission of
   IPv6 packets found in [ISATAP,4]. The sending rules and address map-
   ping in [ISATAP,4.4] are not used, however; the address mapping
   specification for multicast in [6OVER4,6] is used instead. The

   following additional sending rule is specificed:

     - the IPv6 next-hop address for packets sent on the
       6OVER4/ISATAP pseudo-interface MUST be 'All-Nodes Multicast'

   On networks that deploy ISATAP and a full or partial native IPv4 mul-
   ticast capability, this optional mechanism allows ISATAP routers to
   send periodic unsolicited multicast Router Advertisement messages and
   for ISATAP hosts to process any such Router Advertisements received
   as specified below:


5.  Router Specification

   Advertising ISATAP interfaces of routers behave exactly the same as
   [ISATAP,5.2.3]. Routers MAY OPTIONALLY configure a 6OVER4/ISATAP
   pseudo interface on any of their ISATAP interfaces for the sole pur-
   pose of sending periodic unsolicited multicast Router Advertisements,
   exactly as specified in [DISC,6.2.4]. The configuration variables in
   [DISC,6.2.1] are used.


6.  Host Specification

   Hosts behave exactly the same as [ISATAP,5.2.4]. Hosts MAY OPTIONALLY
   configure a 6OVER4/ISATAP pseudo interface on any ISATAP interface
   for the sole purpose of receiving periodic unsolicited multicast
   Router Advertisements. The 6OVER4/ISATAP pseudo-interface presents
   received multicast Router Advertisements to its attaching ISATAP
   interface, which processes them exactly as specified in [ISA-
   TAP,5.2.4].


7.  Deployment Considerations

   This optional mechanism SHOULD only be used on networks with a full
   or partial native IPv4 multicast routing deployment. Network adminis-
   trators SHOULD configure values for the variables found in 'Router
   Specification' to provide an appropriate tradeoff between fast con-
   vergence and control traffic overhead based on characteristics of the
   underlying network.


8.  IANA considerations

   No assignments by IANA are required beyond those in [6OVER4][ISATAP].

9.  Security considerations

   Security considerations are the same as for [ISATAP,8].
