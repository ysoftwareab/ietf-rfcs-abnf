1. Abstract 
   
   The purpose of this Internet Draft is  to  start  discussion  on  the
   issues  involved  in  PSTN  Internet  Notification  (PIN), as part of
   interconnecting IP and Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)  with
   the intent of converging existing and creating new hybrid PSTN and IP 
   services.   PSTN  Events  Notification,  based  on  open well-defined
   protocols, will promote interoperability of  both  the  networks  and
   systems built by different vendors.  This Internet Draft is submitted 
   with the goal of becoming an informational RFC.  
   
   The rest of this document is as follows: 
   
   Section 2 briefly describes the PIN services.  
   
   Section  3 describes the scope of the proposed project by introducing

2. PIN Description 
   Current  PSTN/Internet  Interfaces  (PINT)  WG  addresses  connection
   arrangements  through  which  Internet  applications  can request and
   enrich PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) telephony services.  
   
   Some Interworking services  require  Notification  and  requests  for
   services  that come from PSTN/IN. Essentially, these requests will be
   "mirror image" of PINT requests.  
   To provide interoperability between PSTN and IP networks, it is  very
   important  to  ensure  notification  to  IP  network  of  the  events
   happening in PSTN.  
   PSTN/IN Call Flow is  organized  around  actions  or  collections  of
   actions called Point-In-Call (PIC). Detection Points (DPs), which are 
   associated  with  the  PICs, operate between the PICs, and can be the
   basis for Notification Events for Interworking with IP network.    IN
   furnishes  "Network  Intelligence"  to  PSTN.  Similarly,  it  can be
   utilized to initiate Notification Events to IP network.  
   PSTN/IN events can be grouped into two categories: 
   
   Basic events: 
   1. Phone off-hook.  
   2. Phone on-hook.  
   3. Voice-mail Arrival.  
   4. Incoming Call Notification (Attempt to Terminate Call).  
   
   
   Advanced events: 
   1. Attempt to dial number (specific event can be Attempt to Dial  ISP
      Number.  
   2. Dropping Dialed Connection (i.e. dropping ISP call).  
   3. ISP Connection Made.  
   4.  Attempt to Forward Call (forwarded end point could easily be VoIP
       terminal).  
   5. Attempt to Subscribe/Unsubscribe for a PSTN Service (i.e.  Set  Up
      Call Forwarding).  
   6. Attempt to Enter Conference. (Notification only) 
   7. Attempt to Exit Conference. (Notification only) 
   8.  Identification  of  the  Speaker  (talking  party)  to  the other
   participants of the Voice (or  multimedia)  Conference  (Notification
   only).

   Examples  of services that are based on PIN, or use PIN as one of the
   building blocks are: 
   
   1. Internet Call Waiting. ICW is the capability to  provide  incoming
   call  notification and completion options when the Subscriber is on a
   dial-up IP connection.  
   2. Internet Call  Management.  PSTN  call  notification  and  control
   options  (flexible call screening, forwarding, etc.), delivered to an
   IP client.  
   3. Internet Conference Management. PSTN  Teleconference  notification
   and management from an IP Client 
   4.  Internet  Conference  Mediation.  Pre-Teleconference  (before  an
   actual connection is made) management service from an IP client.  
   5.  Advanced  Caller  ID  Delivery   [7].   Ordered   incoming   call
   notification to multiple Subscriber's dial-up IP connections.  
   6.  Queue  Management.  Notification  of the status and events of the
   call queue, much needed for the IP-based Call Center Control.  
   7. Call Progress Delivery as part of PINT  services.    Classic  PINT
   services need notification of the Call Progress.  
   8.  Internet  Call Routing (ICR). Flexible routing and control over a
   dial up PSTN call from an IP host.  
   
   
   3. Proposed Architecture 
   
   With the proliferation and wide acceptance of the Internet, and  more
   so  with  the  convergence  of  the  Internet  and  PSTN, there is an
   increasing  desire for events occurring on  the  PSTN  domain  to  be
   propagated to the Internet domain.  The PIN protocol attempts to fill 
   this void.    Entities  on the Internet domain can receive the events
   generated by the PSTN  domain  and  act  appropriately.    The  major
   entities  that  comprise of the PIN protocol are the PIN gateway, the
   PIN server and various PIN clients, as depicted in Figure 1.

   Figure A illustrates the functional scalable architecture  that  will
   support PIN Services.  
   
   Legend:   SNF - Service Notification Function
          .-. - PIN Protocol
          --- - Standard Client/Server Protocol or, potentially, 
                PIN Protocol
          ... - Standard PSTN/SS7/IN Protocol
   
   Service  Notification  Function  (SNF)  is located in PSTN domain and
   physically can reside  in  IN  elements  (SCP,  SMS,  SSP)  that  are
   specialized  servers,  connected  to switches and other PSTN elements
   [3].  SNF (PSTN) informs the PIN Gateway of the PSTN events utilizing 
   traditional protocols (SS7/IN). PIN Gateway then relays these  events
   to one  or  more  PIN  Servers.  PIN Server provides Subscription for
   Notification Services and  aggregates  Notification  events  for  PIN
   Clients.  A  PIN  Client is an IP end-point, which has subscribed for
   PIN services with one or more PIN Servers.  
   PIN protocol is a specialized protocol used for communication between 
   the PIN gateway and PIN servers, which may, potentially, be used  for
   communications between PIN Servers and PIN Clients.  
   
   We are proposing new Working Group to be a "mirror image" of the PINT 
   WG,  regarding direction of the requests for service and dealing with
   Notification only.  
   Like PINT, PIN will not deal with IP Telephony,  but  rather  provide
   requests for services and Notifications from PSTN/IN to IP network in 
   order to augment, extend and enrich PSTN.  
   PIN  WG  will focus on the PIN Protocol Requirements and, optionally,
   Definition of Notification  Processing  Language  (NPL),  a  possible
   extension to CPL, as well as defining connections of the Notification 
   Services to  the  IN  DPs.   NPL will allow to build new Notification
   Services and provide  means  to  describe  Notification  Filters  for
   Notification screening.  
   (Notification  Filter  example:  Notification for an Attempt to Enter
   Conference from a predefined number in the hours 9 through 17 only on 
    weekends and holidays.) 
   It is quite possible that existing  or  under  development  protocols
   (i.e.  SIP,  PIP  [8],  MGCP,  etc.)  are  sufficient  to support PIN
   Services, but that  determination is for further study.  
   
   4. Security Considerations 
   
   PIN communications between the PIN Client, PIN  Server,  PIN  Gateway
   and  the  SNF  may  travel over the Internet. Thus it is essential to
   provide encryption  for  the  communications.      In   addition   to
   encryption,  it  is also necessary to provide  authentication of both
   the end points; i.e.  SNF and  PIN  Client.    PIN  security  has  to
   authenticate  both  end  points  and if the authentication succeeded,
   encrypt the communications.

   PIN Security Requirements are, essentially, the same as PINT Security 
   Requirements outlined in [4]: 
   
   o Peer entity authentication to allow a communicating entity to prove 
   its identity to another in the network.  
   
   o Non-repudiation to account for all operations in case of  doubt  or
   dispute.   This  could  be  achieved  by  logging all the information
   pertinent to the transaction.  In addition,  the  PSTN  network  will
   maintain its own account of the transaction for generating bills.  
   
   o  Confidentiality  to  avoid  disclosure  of information without the
   permission of its owner.  Although this is an essential  requirement,
   it is not particular to the proposed project.  
   
   o  PIN  Client  profile  verification  to  verify  if the end user is
   authorized to use a service.  
   
   In the course of the project execution, additional  requirements  are
   likely to arise and many more specific security work items are likely 
   to be proposed and implemented.   
   
   Some of the PIN-specific security considerations: 
   o  Cracking  is  a  threat  to  any Service Provider (PSTN, Intranet,
   Internet). It is real danger - phone companies are common targets 
   o Notification spoofing is one of the threats 
   o Existing mechanisms applied to the Internet can be implemented 
   o Stealing a Notification is a new type of security threat
