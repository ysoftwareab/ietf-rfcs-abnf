Introduction</h3>

<p>In the context of MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP, see <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-framework'>[8]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bocci, M., Bryant, S., Frost, D., Levrau, L., and L. Berger, &ldquo;A Framework for MPLS in Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#RFC5654'>[1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Niven-Jenkins, B., Brungard, D., Betts, M., Sprecher, N., and S. Ueno, &ldquo;Requirements of an MPLS Transport Profile,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>), the rationales for Operations, Administration
      and Maintenance (OAM) are twofold as it can serve:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>as a network-oriented functionality, used by a transport network
          operator to monitor his network infrastructure and to implement
          internal mechanisms in order to enhance the general behaviour and
          the level of performance of his network (e.g., protection mechanism
          in case of node or link failure). As an example, fault localization
          is typically associated with this use case.
</li>
<li>as a service-oriented functionality, used by a transport service
          provider to monitor services offered to end customers in order to be
          able to react rapidly in case of a problem and to be able to verify
          some of the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) parameters (e.g., using
          performance monitoring) negotiated with the end customers. Note that
          a transport service could be provided over several networks or
          administrative domains that may not all be owned and managed by the
          same transport service provider.
</li>
</ul>

<p>More generally, OAM is an important and fundamental functionality in
      transport networks as it contributes to:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>the reduction of operational complexity and costs, by allowing
          for efficient and automatic detection, localisation, handling and
          diagnosis of defects, as well as by minimizing service interruptions
          and operational repair times.
</li>
<li>the enhancement of network availability, by ensuring that
          defects, for example resulting in misdirected customer traffic, and
          faults, are detected, diagnosed and dealt with before a customer
          reports the problem.
</li>
<li>meeting service and performance objectives, as the OAM
          functionality allows for SLA verification in a multi-maintenance
          domain environment and allows for the determination of service
          degradation due, for example, to packet delay or packet loss.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
Scope of this Document</h3>

<p>This document lists architectural and functional requirements for
        the OAM functionality of MPLS-TP. These requirements apply to
        pseudowires (PWs), Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and Sections.
</p>
<p>These requirements are derived from the set of requirements
        specified by ITU-T and published in the ITU-T Supplement Y.Sup4 <a class='info' href='#Y.Sup4'>[9]<span> (</span><span class='info'>ITU-T Supplement Y.Sup4, &ldquo;ITU-T Y.1300-series: Supplement on transport requirements for           T-MPLS OAM and considerations for the application of IETF MPLS           technology,&rdquo; 2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>By covering transport specificities, these requirements complement
        those identified in RFC 4377 <a class='info' href='#RFC4377'>[10]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nadeau, T., Morrow, M., Swallow, G., Allan, D., and S. Matsushima, &ldquo;Operations and Management (OAM) Requirements for Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Networks,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>, yet some
        requirements may be similar.
</p>
<p>This document only lists architectural and functional OAM
        requirements. It does not detail the implications of their
        applicability to the various types (e.g., point-to-point,
        point-to-multipoint, unidirectional, bidirectional ...) of PWs, LSPs
        and Sections. Furthermore, this document does not provide requirements
        on how the protocol solution(s) should behave to achieve the
        functional objectives. Please see <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework'>[11]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Allan, D., Busi, I., Niven-Jenkins, B., Fulignoli, A., Hernandez-Valencia, E., Levrau, L., Mohan, D., Sestito, V., Sprecher, N., Helvoort, H., Vigoureux, M., Weingarten, Y., and R. Winter, &ldquo;MPLS-TP OAM Framework,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> for further
        information.
</p>
<p>Note that the OAM functions identified in this document may be used
        for fault management, performance monitoring and/or protection
        switching applications. For example, connectivity verification can be
        used for fault management by detecting failure conditions, but may
        also be used for performance monitoring through its contribution to
        the evaluation of performance metrics (e.g., unavailability time).
        Nevertheless, it is outside the scope of this document to specify
        which function should be used for which application.
</p>
<p>Note also that it is anticipated that implementers may wish to
        implement OAM message handling in hardware. Although not a
        requirement, this fact could be taken as a design consideration.

<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h3>1.2.&nbsp;
Requirements Language and Terminology</h3>

<p>Although this document is not a protocol specification, the key
        words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
        "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be
        interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <a class='info' href='#RFC2119'>[2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a>
        and are to be interpreted as instructions to the protocol designers
        producing solutions that satisfy the requirements set out in this
        document.
</p>
<p>In this document we refer to the inability of a function to perform
        a required action, as a fault. This does not include an inability due
        to preventive maintenance, lack of external resources, or planned
        actions. See also ITU-T G.806 <a class='info' href='#G.806'>[3]<span> (</span><span class='info'>ITU-T Recommendation G.806, &ldquo;Characteristics of transport equipment - Description           methodology and generic functionality,&rdquo; 2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>In this document we refer to the situation in which the density of
        anomalies has reached a level where the ability to perform a required
        function has been interrupted, as a defect. See also ITU-T G.806 <a class='info' href='#G.806'>[3]<span> (</span><span class='info'>ITU-T Recommendation G.806, &ldquo;Characteristics of transport equipment - Description           methodology and generic functionality,&rdquo; 2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>In this document we refer to OAM actions which are carried out
        continuously or at least on long periods of time, permitting proactive
        reporting of fault and/or performance results, as proactive OAM.
</p>
<p>In this document we refer to OAM actions which are initiated via
        manual intervention for a limited time to carry out troubleshooting,
        as on-demand OAM.
</p>
<p>In this document we refer to a Label Edge Router (LER), for a given

OAM Requirements</h3>

<p>This section lists the requirements by which the OAM functionality of
      MPLS-TP should abide.
</p>
<p>The requirements listed below may be met by one or more OAM
      protocols; the definition or selection of these protocols is outside the

      the MPLS-TP design SHOULD as far as reasonably possible reuse existing
      MPLS standards. This general requirement applies to MPLS-TP OAM. MPLS-TP
      OAM is defined in this document through a set of functional
      requirements. These requirements will be met by protocol solutions
      defined in other documents. The way in which those protocols are
      operated and the way in which a network operator can control and use the
      MPLS-TP OAM functions SHOULD be as similar as possible to the mechanisms
      and techniques used to operate OAM in other transport technologies.

Scope of OAM</h3>

<p>The protocol solution(s) developed to meet the requirements

</p>
<p>The service emulated by a PW may span multiple domains. An LSP
          may also span multiple domains. The protocol solution(s) MUST be
          applicable end-to-end and to segments. More generally, it MUST be
          possible to operate OAM functions on a per domain basis and across
          multiple domains.
</p>
<p>Since LSPs may be stacked, the protocol solution(s) MUST be
          applicable on any LSP, regardless of the label stack depth.
          Furthermore it MUST be possible to estimate OAM fault and
          performance metrics of a single PW or LSP segment or of an aggregate
          of PWs or LSPs segments.

Independence</h3>

<p>The protocol solution(s) SHOULD be independent of the underlying
          tunnelling or point-to-point technology or transmission media.
</p>
<p>The protocol solution(s) SHOULD be independent of the service a
          PW may emulate.
</p>
<p>Any OAM function operated on a PW, LSP or Section SHOULD be
          independent of the OAM function(s) operated on a different PW, LSP
          or Section. In other words, only the OAM functions operated on e.g.,
          a given LSP should be used to achieve the OAM objectives for that
          LSP.
</p>
<p>The protocol solution(s) MUST support the capability to be
          concurrently and independently operated end-to-end and on segments.
          Therefore, any OAM function applied to segment(s) of a PW or LSP
          SHOULD be independent of the OAM function(s) operated on the
          end-to-end PW or LSP. It SHOULD also be possible to distinguish an
          OAM packet running over a segment of a PW or LSP from another OAM
          packet running on the end-to-end PW or LSP.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, any OAM function applied to segment(s) of a PW or
          LSP SHOULD be independent of the OAM function(s) applied to other
          segment(s) of the same PW or LSP.

Data Plane</h3>

<p>OAM functions operate in the data plane. OAM packets MUST run
          in-band; that is, OAM packets for a specific PW, LSP or Section MUST
          follow the exact same data path as user traffic of that PW, LSP or
          Section. This is often referred to as fate sharing.
</p>
<p>It MUST be possible to discriminate user traffic from OAM
          packets. This includes a means to differentiate OAM packets from
          user traffic as well as the capability to apply specific treatment
          to OAM packets, at the nodes processing these OAM packets.
</p>
<p>As part of the design of OAM protocol solution(s) for MPLS-TP, a
          mechanism, for enabling the encapsulation and differentiation of OAM
          messages on a PW, LSP or Section, MUST be provided. Such mechanism
          SHOULD also support the encapsulation and differentiation of
          existing IP/MPLS and PW OAM messages.

OAM and IP Capabilities</h3>

<p>There are environments where IP capabilities are present in the
          data plane. IP/MPLS environments are examples of such environments.
          There are also environments where IP capabilities may not be present
          in the data plane. MPLS-TP environments are examples of environments
          where IP capabilities might or might not be
          present.<br />
Presence or absence of IP capabilities is
          deployment scenario dependent.
</p>
<p>It MUST be possible to deploy the OAM functionality in any of
          these environments. As a result, it MUST be possible to operate OAM
          functions with or without relying on IP capabilities and it MUST be
          possible to choose to make use of IP capabilities when these are
          present.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the mechanism required for enabling the
          encapsulation and differentiation of OAM messages (see <a class='info' href='#DP'>Section&nbsp;2.1.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Data Plane</span><span>)</span></a>) MUST support the capability to differentiate
          OAM messages of an OAM function operated by relying on IP
          capabilities (e.g., using encapsulation in an IP header) from OAM
          messages of an OAM function operated without relying on any IP
          capability.
</p>
<p>Note that IP capabilities include the capability to form a
          standard IP header, to encapsulate a payload in an IP header, to
          parse and analyse the fields of an IP header and to take actions
          based on the content of these fields.
</p>
<p>For certain functions, OAM messages need to incorporate
          identification information (e.g., of source and/or destination
          nodes). The protocol solution(s) MUST at least support
          identification information in the form of an IP addressing structure
          and MUST also be extensible to support additional identification
          schemes.

          delay of a PW, LSP or Section.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The one-way delay is defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC2679'>[6]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M. Zekauskas, &ldquo;A One-way Delay Metric for IPPM,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a> to be the time elapsed from the start

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>This document, in itself, does not imply any security consideration
      but OAM, as such, is subject to several security considerations. OAM
      messages can reveal sensitive information such as passwords, performance
      data and details about e.g., the network topology.
</p>
<p>The nature of OAM therefore suggests having some form of
      authentication, authorization and encryption in place. This will prevent
      unauthorized access to MPLS-TP equipment and it will prevent third
      parties from learning about sensitive information about the transport
      network.
</p>
<p>OAM systems (network management stations) SHOULD be designed such
      that OAM functions cannot be accessed without authorization.
</p>
<p>OAM protocol solutions MUST include the facility for OAM messages to
      authenticated to prove their origin and to make sure that they are
      destined for the receiving node. The use of such facilities MUST be
      configurable.
</p>
<p>An OAM packet received over a PW, LSP or Section MUST NOT be
      forwarded beyond the End Point of that PW, LSP or Section, so as to
      avoid that the OAM packet leaves the current administrative domain.
