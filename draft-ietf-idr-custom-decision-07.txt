                      BGP Custom Decision Process
                   draft-ietf-idr-custom-decision-07

Abstract

   The BGP specification describes a Decision Process for selecting the
   best route.  This process uses a series of steps, made up of path
   attributes and other values, to first determine the Degree of
   Preference of a route and later as tie breakers.  While existing
   mechanisms may achieve some of the same results described in this
   document, they can only do so through extensive configuration such as
   matching communities to explicit policy and/or route preference
   configurations present on each BGP speaker within their
   administrative domain (autonomous system).  Implementing some
   specific fine grained policies through such mechanisms is cumbersome,
   if even possible.

   This document defines a new Extended Community, called the Cost
   Community, which may be used as part of the Decision Process.  The
   end result is a local Custom Decision Process.

1.  Introduction

   The BGP specification defines a Decision Process [RFC4271] for
   selecting the best route.  This process uses a series of steps, made
   up of path attributes and other values, to first determine the Degree
   of Preference of a route and later as tie breakers.  While existing
   mechanisms may achieve some of the same results described in this
   document, they can only do so through extensive configuration such as
   matching communities to explicit policy and/or route preference

   configurations present on each BGP speaker within their
   administrative domain (autonomous system).  Implementing some
   specific fine grained policies through such mechanisms is cumbersome,
   if even possible.  For example:

   o  Local Preference: The LOCAL_PREF is an attribute used to calculate
      the Degree of Preference in the Decision Process.  There is no
      secondary degree of preference indicator available that can be
      considered after the MED, IGP metric, or other attributes.

   o  Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED): The MULTI_EXIT_DISC is an
      indicator of which local entrance point an AS would like a peering
      AS to use.  As the MED is compared before the IGP metric, there is
      no way to set the MED so a route with a higher IGP metric is
      preferred over one with a lower IGP metric.

   o  IGP Metric: It is possible, to influence individual routes, but
      only by changing the next hops, and configuring the IGP metric for
      reaching them.  This method is cumbersome and prone to confusion
      and error.

   This document defines a new Extended Community [RFC4360], called the
   Cost Community, which may be used as part of the Decision Process.
   The end result is a local Custom Decision Process.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].




3.  The BGP Cost Community

   The BGP Cost Community is an Opaque Extended Community [RFC4360]
   defined as follows:

   Type Field:
      The value of the high-order octet is determined by provisioning
      [RFC4360].  IANA has assigned the codepoint value 0x01 to 'Cost
      Community' in both the Transitive Opaque Extended Community Sub-
      Types registry and the Non-Transitive Opaque Extended Community
      Sub-Types registry.

   Value Field:




Retana & White             Expires May 4, 2016                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         BGP Custom Decision Process         November 2015


      The Value field contains three distinct sub-fields, described
      below:

                     +------------------------------+
                     | Point of Insertion (1 octet) |
                     +------------------------------+
                     | Community-ID (1 octet)       |
                     +------------------------------+
                     | Cost (4 octets)              |
                     +------------------------------+

      The Point of Insertion (POI) sub-field indicates *after*, or
      *instead of*, which step in the Decision Process the Cost
      Community MUST be considered.

         The value of the POI may reference a path attribute used in the
         Decision Process.  In this case the Cost Community is
         considered after, or instead of, the step where the path
         attribute is considered.

         The Decision Process includes some steps that do not correspond
         to any path attribute; the following values are defined:

         128  ABSOLUTE_VALUE - Indicates that the Cost Community MUST be
            considered as the first step in determining the Degree of
            Preference of a route (Section 9.1.1 of [RFC4271]).  If two
            routes have the same Cost, then the rest of the Calculation
            of Degree of Preference is to be followed.

         129  IGP_COST - Indicates that the Cost Community MUST be
            considered after the interior (IGP) distance to the next-hop
            has been compared.

         130  EXTERNAL_INTERNAL - Indicates that the Cost Community MUST
            be considered after Paragraph d of Section 9.1.2.2 of
            [RFC4271].

         131  BGP_ID - Indicates that the Cost Community MUST be
            considered after the BGP Identifier (or ORIGINATOR_ID
            [RFC4456]) has been compared.

         This document creates a new Cost Community Point of Insertion
         Registry (Section 7.1) that includes the relevant path
         attributes and these other values.

      The Community-ID sub-field contains an identifier to distinguish
      between multiple instances of the Cost Community.  The high-order

Internet-Draft         BGP Custom Decision Process         November 2015


      bit indicates that the Cost Community MUST replace the step
      indicated by the POI in the Decision Process.

         If the high-order bit is set, the Cost in the Cost Community
         may replace the value of a path attribute at a specific step in
         the Decision Process, but not the attribute itself.  For
         example, if the high-order bit is set with the AS_PATH POI, the
         AS_PATH attribute would still be used for loop prevention
         [RFC4271], but the Cost would replace its length in the
         Decision Process.

         The high-order bit MUST be ignored when used with the
         ABSOLUTE_VALUE POI.

         If the Accumulated IGP Metric Attribute (AIGP) [RFC7311] is
         used such that the "AIGP-enhanced interior cost" replaces the
         "interior cost" tie breaker in the Decision Process, and the
         high-order bit is set with the IGP_COST POI, then the Cost
         Community SHOULD be ignored in favor of the process described
         in Section 4.2 of [RFC7311].

      The Cost sub-field is a 32-bit unsigned integer.  It contains a
      value assigned by the network administrator that is significant to
      their administrative domain.  The default Cost is 0x7FFFFFFF (half
      the maximum).

         If the Cost Community is inserted after a step in the Decision
         Process, and is therefore only compared to other Cost
         Communities, the lower Cost MUST be preferred.

         If the Cost Community replaces a step in the Decision Process,
         it MUST be treated exactly as the value it is replacing would
         be treated.  It is up to the network administrator to select
         the appropriate Cost to use when replacing a specific step; the
         method to do that is outside the scope of this document.

4.  Operation

   The network administrator may use the Cost Community to assign a Cost
   to a route originated, or learned from a peer, in any part of their
   administrative domain.  The POI MUST also be specified.

   If a BGP speaker receives a route that contains the Cost Community,
   it MUST consider its Cost at the POI specified, during the Decision
   Process.

   If the POI is not valid for the local Decision Process
   implementation, then the Cost Community SHOULD be silently ignored.

Internet-Draft         BGP Custom Decision Process         November 2015


   Multiple Cost Communities may indicate the same POI.  All the Cost
   Communities for a specific POI MUST be considered starting with the
   one(s) with the lowest Community-ID.  If multiple Cost Communities,
   for the same POI, with the same Community-ID are received for the
   same route from the same peer, then all except the one with the
   lowest Cost MUST be silently ignored.

   Routes that do not contain the Cost Community (for a valid,
   particular POI), or a Community-ID present in a route from another
   peer, MUST be considered to have the default Cost.

   If a range of routes is to be aggregated and the resultant aggregate
   path attributes do not carry the ATOMIC_AGGREGATE attribute, then the
   resulting aggregate SHOULD have an Extended Communities path
   attribute which contains the set union of all the Cost Communities
   from all of the aggregated routes.  If multiple Cost Communities for
   the same POI (and with the same Community-ID) exist, then only the
   ones with the highest Cost SHOULD be included.

   If the non-transitive version of a Cost Community is received across
   an Autonomous System boundary, then the receiver MUST strip it off
   the BGP update, and ignore it during the Decision Process.

5.  Deployment Considerations

   The mechanisms described in this document may be used to modify the
   Decision Process arbitrarily.  It is important that a consistent
   Decision Process be maintained across the local Autonomous System to
   avoid potential routing loops.  In other words, all the nodes in the
   AS that may have to consider the Cost Community at any POI MUST
   support the mechanisms described in this document.

   Any mechanism which allows the modification of the Decision Process
   is capable of forming persistent routing loops in the control plane.
   Network administrators deploying the Cost Community MUST ensure that
   each impacted router in the network supports them, including the POIs
   deployed within their network.  This is similar in scope to a network
   administrator who uses communities [RFC1997] combined with filters or
   other policies to modify the Decision Process of BGP speakers.
   Consistency must be enforced at an administrative level.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a new Extended Community, called the Cost
   Community, which may be used to customize the Decision Process.  As
   such, the considerations outlined in [RFC4360] and [RFC4271] do not
   change.

Internet-Draft         BGP Custom Decision Process         November 2015


   To minimize the potential of creating routing loops (Section 5) or
   otherwise affecting the Decision Process in unintended ways, the
   propagation of Cost Communities MUST be disabled by default and MUST
   be explicitly enabled by the network administrator.  Furthermore, all
   transitive Cost Communities received across an Autonomous System
   boundary without explicit configuration MUST be stripped off the BGP
   update, and ignored during the Decision Process.

   An ill-designed policy deployment using the Cost Community (e.g. one
   where there is no consistent POI support throughout the AS) may
   result in persistent routing loops that could result in loss of
   traffic.  The design and implementation of policies for best route
   selection are outside the scope of this document.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the codepoint value 0x01 to 'Cost Community' in
   both the Transitive Opaque Extended Community Sub-Types registry and
   the Non-Transitive Opaque Extended Community Sub-Types registry.

   Section 3 also defines a series of values to be used to indicate
   steps in the Decision Process that do not map directly to a path
   attribute.  IANA is expected to maintain a registry for the Cost
   Community POI values.

   o  Values 1 through 127 are to be assigned using the "Standards
      Action" policy or the Early Allocation process [RFC7120].

   o  Values 128 through 191 are to be assigned using the "IETF
      Consensus" policy.

   o  Values 192 through 254 are to be assigned using the "First Come
      First Served" policy.

   o  Values 0 and 255 are reserved.

   All the policies mentioned are documented in [RFC5226].

   The table in Section 7.1 shows the initial allocations for the new
   Cost Community Point of Insertion registry.
