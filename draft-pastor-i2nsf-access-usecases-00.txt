Internet-Draft         Access Use Cases for I2NSF           October 2014


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use cases for an open OAM interfce to
   virtualized network security services in residential and mobile
   network access.

   Not only enterprise customers, but also residential and mobile ones
   are becoming more and more aware of the need for security, just to
   find that security services are hard to operate and become expensive
   in the case of reasonably sophisticated ones.  This general trend has
   caused that numerous operators and security vendors start to leverage
   cloud-based models to deliver security solutions.  In particular, the
   methods around Network Function Virtualization (NFV) are meant to
   facilitate the management of various resources for the benefit of
   customers, who may not own or physically host those network
   functions.

   This document analyzes the use cases for the provision, operation and
   management of virtualized Network Security Function (vNSF) in the
   access network environment, as shown in the following figure.

Internet-Draft         Access Use Cases for I2NSF           October 2014


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS.  Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.


3.  Actors in the Access Environment

   Different types of actors can use an open OAM interface to the vNSFs
   to allocate and operate network security functions.  The envisioned
   actors are:

   o  Network operators that provide and manage vNSF in their
      administrative domain or through external providers.

   o  Customers, accessing through the Network Operator, and requiring a
      security service implemented by one or more vNSF.

   The access network technology environment also defines the
   characteristics of the type of access in each use case:

   o  Closed environments where there is only one administrative network
      domain.  More permissive access controls and lighter validation
      shall be allowed inside the domain because of the protected
      environment.  Integration with existing identity management
      systems is also possible.

   o  Open environments where some vNSFs can be hosted in external
      administrative domains, and more restrictive security controls are
      required.  The interfaces to the vNSFs must use trusted channels.
      Identity frameworks and federations are common models for
      authentication and Authorization.


4.  Operator-Managed Security Functions

   The Virtual CPE described in [NFVUC] use cases #5 and #7 cover the
   model of virtualization for mobile and residential access, where the
   operator may offload security services from the customer local
   environment (or even the terminal) to the operator infrastructure
   supporting the access network.

   This use case defines the operator interaction with vNSF through

Internet-Draft         Access Use Cases for I2NSF           October 2014


   automated interfaces, typically by B2B communications performed by
   the operator management systems (OSS/BSS).

4.1.  vNSF Deployment

   The deployment process consists of instantiating a vNSF on a
   Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI), within the operator
   administrative domain(s) or an external domain.  This is a required
   step before a customer can subscribe to a security service supported
   in the vNSF.

4.2.  vNSF Customer Provisioning

   Once a vNSF is deployed, any customer can subscribe to it.  The
   provisioning lifecycle includes:

   o  Customer enrollment and cancellation of the subscription to a
      vNSF.

   o  Configuration of the vNSF, based on specific configurations or
      derived from common security policies defined by the operator.

   o  Retrieve and list of the vNSF functionalities, extracted from a
      manifest or a descriptor.  The network operator management systems
      can demand this information to offer detailed information through
      the commercial channels to the customer.


5.  Customer-Managed Security Functions

   This is an alternative use case where the management is delegated
   directly to the customer.  The open OAM interface permits direct
   interactions between the vNSF and the customer.  This allows
   customers to have dynamic and flexible interactions with security
   services, more adequate for dynamic allocation of these virtualized
   security services.

5.1.  Self-Provisioning

   This process allows a residential or mobile customer to enroll on its
   own to a security service provided by a vNSF or a set of vNSF.  The
   open OAM interface must support the enrollment process.

5.2.  Validation

   Customers MAY require to validate vNSF availability, provenance, and
   its correct execution.  The validation process includes at least:

Internet-Draft         Access Use Cases for I2NSF           October 2014


   o  Integrity of the vNSF.  The vNSF is not manipulated.

   o  Isolation.  The execution of the vNSF is self-contained for
      privacy requirements in multi-tenancy scenarios.


6.  Policies and Configuration

   vNSF configurations can vary from simple rules (i.e. block a DDoS
   attack) to very complex configuration ( i.e. define a user firewall
   rules per application, protocol, source and destination port and
   address).  The possibility of using configuration templates per vNSF
   type is a common option as well.

   The operator can push security policies using complex configurations
   in their managed vNSF through its management system.  The open OAM
   interface has to accommodate this application-driven behavior.

   Computer-savvy customers may pursue a similar application-driven
   configuration through the open OAM interface, but standard
   residential and mobile customers may prefer to use the definition of
   security policies in the form of close-to-natural-language sentences
   with high-level directives or a guide configuration process.  The
   representation for these policies will be of the form:


   +-------+   +------+   +------+   +------------------+
   |Subject| + |Action| + |Object| + |Field_type = Value|
   +-------+   +------+   +------+   +------------------+


                Figure 2: High-Level Security Policy Format

   Subject indicates the customer or device in the access.

   Action can include a variety of actions: check, redirect, allow,
   block, record, inspect...

   Object can be optional and specifies the nature of the action.  The
   default is all the customer traffic, but others possible values are
   connections and connections attempts.

   Field_type allows to create fine-grained policies, including
   destinations list (i.e.  IPs, domains), content types (i.e. files,
   emails), windows of time (i.e. weekend), protocol or network service
   (i.e.  HTTP).

   An example of a customer policy is:

7.  Security Functions at the Access Network

   This section collects a representative list of use cases of possible
   vNSFs that requires an open OAM interface for control and management.

7.1.  Traffic Inspection

   A common use case for customers accessing the Internet or additional
   services through it is security supervision.  Some examples are:

   o  Intrusion detection systems

   o  Deep packet inspection

   o  Data leakage protection

   An open OAM interface will allow the configuration of the vNSF
   inspection features: signatures updates, behavioral parameters or
   type of traffic to supervise.

7.2.  Traffic Manipulation

   A more intrusive use case of vNSF includes the capacity of manipulate
   the traffic at the access network segment.  Some examples are:

   o  Redirect traffic, as in the case of captive portals

   o  Block traffic: Firewalls, intrusion prevention system, anti-DoS
      mechanisms...

   o  Encrypt traffic: VPN services that encapsulate and encrypt the
      user traffic.  A SSL VPN is a representative example.

   An open OAM interface will allow the configuration of the vNSF
   manipulation features, such as redirect and block rules.

7.3.  Impersonation

   Some vNSFs can impersonate a customer service or Internet service to
   provide security functions.  Some examples are:

   o  Honeypots, impersonating customer services, such as HTTP, NetBios
      or SSH

   o  Anonymization services, hiding the source identity, as in the case
      of TOR

   An open OAM interface will allow the configuration of the vNSF
   impersonation features, like the service to impersonate.
