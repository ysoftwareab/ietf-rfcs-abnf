             Using Flex-Algo for Segment Routing based VTN
                 draft-zhu-lsr-isis-sr-vtn-flexalgo-04

Abstract

   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN service to support
   some application's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent
   performance requirements.  VPN+ requires integration between the
   overlay VPN connectivity and the characteristics provided by the
   underlay network.  A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual
   underlay network which has a customized network topology and a set of
   network resources allocated from the physical network.  A VTN could
   be used as the underlay for one or a group of VPN+ services.

   The topological constraints of a VTN can be defined using Flex-Algo.
   In some network scenarios, each VTN can be associated with a unique
   Flex-Algo, and the set of network resources allocated to a VTN can be
   instantiated as layer-2 sub-interfaces or member links of the layer-3
   interfaces.  This document describes the mechanisms to build the SR
   based VTNs using SR Flex-Algo and IGP L2 bundle with minor
   extensions.

1.  Introduction

   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to support the
   needs of new applications, particularly including the applications
   that are associated with 5G services.  These applications require
   enhanced isolation and have more stringent performance requirements
   than that can be provided with traditional overlay VPNs.  Thus these
   properties require integration between the underlay and the overlay
   networks.  [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn] specifies the framework of
   enhanced VPN and describes the candidate component technologies in
   different network planes and layers.  An enhanced VPN may be used for
   5G transport network slicing, and will also be of use in other
   generic scenarios.

   To meet the requirement of enhanced VPN services, a number of virtual
   transport networks (VTN) can be created, each with a subset of the
   underlay network topology and a set of network resources allocated
   from the underlay network to meet the requirement of a specific VPN+

   service or a group of VPN+ services.  Another possible approach is to
   create a set of point-to-point paths, each with a set of network
   resource reserved along the path, such paths are called Virtual
   Transport Paths (VTPs).  Although using a set of dedicated VTPs can
   provide similar characteristics as VTN, it has some scalability
   issues due to the per-path state in the network.

   [I-D.ietf-spring-resource-aware-segments] introduces resource
   awareness to Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402].  As described in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-for-enhanced-vpn], the resource-aware SIDs can be
   used to build VTNs with the required network topology and network
   resource attributes to support VPN+ services.  With segment routing
   based data plane, Segment Identifiers (SIDs) can be used to represent
   both the topology and the set of network resources allocated by
   network nodes to a VTN.  The SIDs of each VTN together with its
   associated topology and resource attributes need to be distributed
   using control plane.

   [I-D.dong-lsr-sr-enhanced-vpn] defines the IGP mechanisms and
   extensions to provide scalable Segment Routing (SR) based VTNs.  The
   mechanism in [I-D.dong-lsr-sr-enhanced-vpn] allows flexible
   combination of the topology and resource attribute to provide a
   relatively large number of VTNs.  In some network scenarios, each VTN
   can be associated with a unique Flex-Algo, and the set of network
   resources allocated to the VTN can be instantiated using layer-2 sub-
   interfaces or member links of the L3 interfaces.  This document
   describes a mechanism to build the SR based VTNs using SR Flex-Algo
   and IGP L2 bundle with minor extensions.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP14 RFC 2119 [RFC2119] RFC 8174 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
   appear in all capitals, as shown here.

2.  Advertisement of SR VTN Topology Attributes


   [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo] specifies the mechanism to provide
   distributed constraint-path computation, and the usage of SR-MPLS
   prefix-SIDs and SRv6 locators for steering traffic along the
   constrained paths.

   The Flex-Algo Definition (FAD) is the combination of calculation-
   type, metric-type and the topological constraints used for path
   computation.  According to the network nodes' participation of a

Internet-Draft            Flex-Algo for SR VTN                March 2022


   Flex-Algo, and the rules of including or excluding Admin Groups (i.e.
   colors) and Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs), the topology of a VTN
   can be described using the associated Flex-Algo.  If each VTN is
   associated with a unique Flex-Algo, the Flex-Algo identifier could be
   reused as the identifier of the VTN in the control plane.

   With the mechanisms defined in[RFC8667] [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo], SR-
   MPLS prefix-SID advertisement can be associated with a specific
   topology and a specific algorithm, which can be a Flex-Algo.  This
   allows the nodes to use the prefix-SIDs to steer traffic along
   distributed computed constraint paths according to the associated
   Flex-Algo in a particular topology.

   [I-D.ietf-lsr-isis-srv6-extensions] specifies the IS-IS extensions to
   support SRv6 data plane, in which the SRv6 locators advertisement is
   associated with a topology and a specific algorithm, which can be a
   Flex-Algo.  This allows the nodes to use the SRv6 locators to steer
   traffic along distributed computed constraint paths according to the
   associated Flex-Algo in a particular topology.  In addition,
   topology/algorithm specific SRv6 End SIDs and End.X SIDs can be used
   to enforce traffic over the Loop-Free Alternatives (LFA) computed
   backup paths.

3.  Advertisement of SR VTN Resource Attributes

   Each VTN can be allocated with a set of dedicated network resources
   on different network nodes and links.  In order to perform constraint
   based path computation for each VTN on network controller and the
   ingress nodes, the resource attribute of each VTN also needs to be
   advertised.  This way, the network controller or the ingress node can
   compute an SR TE path in a VTN by taking both the Flex-Algo
   constraints and the resource attribute of the VTN into consideration.

   IS-IS L2 Bundle [RFC8668] was defined to advertise the link
   attributes of the layer-2 bundle member links.  In this section, it
   is extended to advertise the set of network resource attributes
   associated with different VTNs on a layer-3 link.

   The layer-3 link may or may not be a bundle of layer-2 links, as long
   as it has the capability of partitioning the link resources into
   different subsets for different VTNs it participates in.  One
   partition of the link resources can be instantiated as a layer-2 sub-
   interface, which can be seen as a virtual layer-2 member link of the
   layer-3 link.  If the layer-3 link is a layer-2 link bundle, it is
   possible that the set of link resource allocated to a specific VTN is
   provided by one or multiple physical layer-2 member links.

Internet-Draft            Flex-Algo for SR VTN                March 2022


   A new flag "E" (Exclusive) is defined in the flag field of the Parent
   L3 Neighbor Descriptor in the L2 Bundle Member Attributes TLV (25).

                0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
               |P|E|           |
               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   E flag: When the E flag is set, it indicates each member link under
   the Parent L3 link are used exclusively for one VTN, and load sharing
   among the member links is not allowed.  When the E flag is clear, it
   indicates load balancing and sharing among the member links are
   allowed.

   For each virtual or physical layer-2 member link, the TE attributes
   defined in [RFC5305] such as the Maximum Link Bandwidth and Admin
   Groups SHOULD be advertised using the mechanism as defined in
   [RFC8668].  The SR-MPLS Adj-SIDs or SRv6 End.X SIDs associated with
   each of the virtual or physical Layer-2 member links SHOULD also be
   advertised according to [RFC8668] and [I-D.dong-lsr-l2bundle-srv6].

   In order to correlate the virtual or physical layer-2 member links
   with the Flex-Algo ID which is used to identify the VTN, each VTN
   SHOULD be assigned with a unique Admin Group (AG) or Extended Admin
   Group (EAG), and the virtual or physical layer-2 member links
   associated with this VTN SHOULD be configured with the AG or EAG
   assigned to the VTN.  The AG or EAG of the parent layer-3 link SHOULD
   be set to the union of all the AGs or EAGs of its virtual or physical
   layer-2 member links.  In the definition of the Flex-Algo
   corresponding to the VTN, It MUST use the Include-Any Admin Group
   rule with only the AG or EAG assigned to the VTN as the link
   constraints, the Include-All Admin Goup rule or the Exclude Admin
   Group rule MUST NOT be used.  This is to ensure that the layer-3 link
   is included in the Flex-Algo constraint based path computation for
   each VTN it participates in.

4.  Forwarding Plane Operations

   For SR-MPLS data plane, a prefix SID is associated with the paths
   calculated using the Flex-Algo corresponding to a VTN.  An outgoing
   layer-3 interface is determined for each path.  In addition, the
   prefix-SID also steers the traffic to use the virtual or physical
   layer-2 member link which is associated with the VTN on the outgoing
   layer-3 interface for packet forwarding.  The Adj-SIDs associated
   with the virtual or physical member links of a VTN MAY be used with
   the prefix-SIDs of the same VTN together to build SR-MPLS TE paths
   with the topological and resource constraints of the VTN.

Internet-Draft            Flex-Algo for SR VTN                March 2022


   For SRv6 data plane, an SRv6 Locator is a prefix which is associated
   with the paths calculated using the Flex-Algo corresponding to a VTN.
   An outgoing Layer-3 interface is determined for each path.  In
   addition, the SRv6 Locator prefix also steers the traffic to use the
   virtual or physical layer-2 member link which is associated with the
   VTN on the outgoing layer-3 interface for packet forwarding.  The
   End.XU SIDs associated with the virtual or physical member links of a
   VTN MAY be used with the SRv6 Locator prefix of the same VTN together
   to build SRv6 paths with the topological and resource constraints of
   the VTN.

5.  Scalability Considerations

   The mechanism described in this document assumes that each VTN is
   associated with a unique Flex-Algo, so that the Flex-Algo IDs can be
   reused to identify the VTNs in the control plane.  While this brings
   the benefit of simplicity, it also has some limitations.  For
   example, it means that even if multiple VTNs share the same
   topological constraints, they still need to be identified using
   different Flex-Algo IDs in the control plane, then independent path
   computation needs to be executed for each VTN.  The number of VTNs
   supported in a network may be dependent on the number of Flex-Algos
   supported, which is related to the number of Flex-Algos defined in
   the protocol (which is 128) and the control plane overhead on network
   nodes.  The mechanism described in this document is applicable to
   network scenarios where the number of required VTN is relatively
   small.  A detailed analysis about the VTN scalability and the
   possible optimizations for supporting a large number of VTNs is
   described in [I-D.dong-teas-nrp-scalability].

6.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no additional security vulnerabilities to
   IS-IS.

   The mechanism proposed in this document is subject to the same
   vulnerabilities as any other protocol that relies on IGPs.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any IANA actions.
