   properties of OLSR and describe possible attacks against the
   integrity of the network routing infrastructure.

   Solutions exist, which address the vulnerabilities discussed in this
   draft.  The intent of this draft is not to discuss various solutions,

1.  Introduction

   A Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET) is a collection of nodes which are
   able to connect on a wireless medium forming an arbitrary and dynamic
   network. Implicitly herein is the ability for the network topology to
   change over time as links in the network appear and disappear.

   In order to enable communication between any two nodes in such a
   MANET, a routing protocol is employed. The abstract task of the rout-
   ing protocol is to discover the topology (and, as the network is
   dynamic, continuing changes to the topology) to ensure that each node
   is able to acquire a recent image of the network topology for con-
   structing routes.

   Currently, two complementary classes of routing protocols exist in
   the MANET world. Reactive protocols acquire routes on demand through
   flooding a ``route request'' (which typically also records the path
   taken) and receiving a ``route reply'' (typically signaling the path
   taken by the route request to arrive at the destination node). I.e.
   the required parts of the topology graph is constructed in a node
   only when needed for data traffic communication. Reactive MANET rout-
   ing protocols include AODV [4] and DSR [6].

   The other class of MANET routing protocols is proactive, i.e. the
   routing protocol ensures that all nodes at all times have sufficient
   topological information to construct routes to all destinations in
   the network. This is achieved through periodic message exchange.
   Proactive MANET routing protocols include OLSR [1] and TBRPF [5].

   A significant issue in the ad-hoc domain is that of the integrity of
   the network itself. AODV, DSR, OLSR and TBRPF allow, according to
   their specifications, any node to participate in the network - the
   assumption  being that all nodes are well-behaving and welcome. If
   that assumptions fails - if the network may count malicious nodes -
   the integrity of the network may fail.

   An orthogonal security issue is that of maintaining confidentiality
   and integrity of the data being exchanged between communications end-
   points in the network (e.g. between a mail server and a mail client).
   The task of ensuring end-to-end security of data communications in
   MANETs is equivalent to that of securing end-to-end security in tra-
   ditional wire-line networks, and is not considered further in this
   draft.

   The primary issue with respect to securing MANET routing protocols is
   thus ensuring the network integrity, even in presence of malicious
   nodes. Security extensions to the reactive protocols AODV and DSR
   exist, in form of SAODV [7] and Ariadne [8]. Assuming that a

INTERNET-DRAFT       Securing OLSR Problem Statement    14 February 2005

   mechanism for key distribution is in place, these extensions employ
   digital signatures on the route request and route reply messages. The
   basic principle being that each node verifies the signature of a mes-
   sage and - if valid - modifies the message (if applicable), signing
   it itself before forwarding the message.

   In this draft, we investigate the issues with security in proactive
   MANET routing protocols in general, and OLSR in particular.

   We point out, that there are different approaches to securing a
   proactive MANET routing protocol in general, and OLSR in particular.
   One such approach is to ensure that only ``trusted'' nodes are admit-
   ted into the network and, subsequently, that these are the only nodes
   used for forwarding traffic. This approach relies on an assumption
   that a trusted node is not, at the same time, misbehaving -- much
   like a company, handing out a key to each employee, assuming that any
   theft will be committed by people outside to the company. Complimen-
   tary to this trusted/non-trusted discrimination of nodes, is the
   ability to detect and deal with the situation where a trusted node
   has become compromised. Specifically, to take a trusted node, detect
   that it is misbehaving and then decide to classify that node as "non-
   trusted" for exclusion from the network. This, however, opens an
   additional vulnerability: a node can be malicious in that it
   "denounces" other (non-malicious) nodes and manages to get these
   excluded from the network.

   While we do not, in the present version of this draft, concern our-
   self with the solution-space, we do point out that any solutions must
   be carefully scrutinized to prevent that they themselves introduce
   other vulnerabilities.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

2.  Proactive MANET Routing Protocols and OLSR Vulnerabilities

   In this section, we will discuss various security vulnerabilities in
   proactive routing protocol for ad hoc networks. We will specifically
   enumerate vulnerabilities in OLSR, however we point out that this
   section does not emphasize ``flaws'' in the OLSR protocol. Rather,
   the vulnerabilities are instances of what all proactive routing pro-
   tocols are subject to.

   When an ad hoc network is operating under a proactive routing proto-
   col, each node has two different (but related) responsibilities.
   Firstly, each node must correctly generate routing protocol control
   traffic, conforming to the protocol specification. Secondly, each
   node is responsible for forwarding routing protocol control traffic
   on behalf of other nodes in the network. Thus incorrect behavior of a
   node can result from either a node generating incorrect control mes-
   sages or from incorrect relaying of control traffic from other nodes.

   Correctly generating and forwarding control traffic can be considered
   as a criterion for having a correctly functioning routing. In other
   words, that the routing protocol is able to consistently provide a
   correct view of the network topology in each network node. This
   assumption implies that all nodes in the network correctly implement
   the routing protocol - specifically that each node correctly pro-
   cesses and emits control traffic. Note that this, in and by itself,
   is not sufficient to ensure that data packets are being correctly
   routed in the network. Indeed, independently of the routing protocol
   being proactive or reactive, a misbehaving node may generate, process
   and relay control traffic correctly while actually not perform data
   traffic forwarding.

   In the remainder of this section, we will investigate how these
   incorrect behaviors may appear in OLSR. We note, that while we employ
   OLSR for the purpose of our descriptions, much of the following
   applies equally for other proactive routing protocols.

2.1.  Jamming

   One vulnerability, common for all routing protocols operating a wire-
   less ad hoc network, is that of ``jamming'' - i.e. that a node gener-
   ates massive amounts of interfering radio transmissions, which will
   prevent legitimate traffic (e.g. control traffic for the routing pro-
   tocol as well as data traffic) on part of a network. This vulnerabil-
   ity cannot be dealt with at the routing protocol level (if at all),
   leaving the network without the ability to maintain connectivity.
   Jamming is somewhat similar to that of network overload and


Clausen (ed.), Baccelli (ed.)                                     [Page 6]
INTERNET-DRAFT       Securing OLSR Problem Statement    14 February 2005

   subsequent denial of service: a sufficiently significant amount of
   routing protocol control traffic is lost, preventing routes to be
   constructed in the network.

2.2.  Incorrect Traffic Generation

   OLSR employs, basically, two different kinds of control traffic:
   HELLO messages and TC messages.  While there are other types of OLSR
   messages (such as MID or HNA), they don't introduce any fundamentally
   different issues, and we therefore concentrate on HELLOs and TCs.  In
   this section, we will describe how a non-conforming node may affect
   the network connectivity through incorrect generation of HELLO and TC
   messages.

   In general, we observe that with respect to control traffic genera-
   tion, a node may misbehave in two different ways: through generating
   control traffic ``pretending'' to be another node (i.e. Identity
   Spoofing) or through advertising incorrect information (links) in the
   control messages (i.e. Link Spoofing). In both cases, the net effect
   is, that incorrect link-state information is introduced into the net-
   work. This incorrect information then leads to the algorithms of the
   routing protocol to operate on incorrect data-sets and, possibly,
   yield incorrect results as a concequence.

2.2.1.  Incorrect HELLO Message Generation

   In terms of HELLO messages, identity spoofing implies that a node
   sends HELLO messages pretending to have the identity of another node.
   E.g. node X sends HELLO messages with the originator address set to
   that of node A, as illustrated in Figure 1. This may result in the
   network containing conflicting routes to node A. Specifically, node X
   will choose MPRs from among its neighbors, signaling this selection
   pretending to have the identity of node A. The MPRs will, subse-
   quently, advertise that they can provide ``last hop'' to node A in
   their TC messages. Conflicting routes to node A, with possible loops,
   may result from this.

    Figure 1: Identity Spoofing of Hello messages. Node X assumes
    the identity of node A for sending HELLO messages. Node B and
    node C may subsequently announce reachability to node A through
    their TC messages.

   Similarly, link spoofing implies that a node sends HELLO messages,
   signaling an incorrect set of neighbors. This may take either of two
   forms: if the set is incomplete, i.e. a node ``ignores'' some neigh-
   bors, the network may be without connectivity to these ``ignored''
   neighbors.

   Alternatively, a compromised node advertising a neighbor-relationship
   to non-present nodes may cause inaccurate MPR selection with the
   result that some nodes may not be reachable in the network.

2.2.2.  Incorrect TC Message Generation

   As for HELLO messages, identity spoofing with respect to TC messages
   implies that a node sends TC messages, pretending to have the iden-
   tity of another node. Effectively, this implies link spoofing since a
   node assuming the identity of another node effectively advertises
   incorrect links to the network.

   Similarly, link spoofing implies that a node sends TC messages,
   advertising an incorrect set of links. This may take either of two
   forms: if the set is incomplete, i.e. a node ``ignores'' links to
   some nodes in its MPR selector set, the network may be without con-
   nectivity to these ``ignored'' neighbors - as well as to neighbors
   which are reachable only through the ``ignored'' neighbors. A node
   may also include non-existing links (i.e. links to non-neighbor
   nodes) in a TC message. This is illustrated in Figure 2. Link spoof-
   ing in TC messages may yield routing loops and conflicting routes in
   the network.

   A node could also simply fail to produce TC control traffic: a node
   may correctly generate HELLO messages, be selected as MPR by other
   nodes, and then not generate the TC messages that indicate it has MPR
   selectors. The net concequence is, that some destinations may not be
   advertised throughout the network and.

2.3.  Incorrect Traffic Relaying

   Nodes in a MANET relays two types of traffic: routing protocol con-
   trol traffic and data traffic. A node may misbehave through failing
   to forward either type of traffic correctly.




Clausen (ed.), Baccelli (ed.)                                    [Page 10]
INTERNET-DRAFT       Securing OLSR Problem Statement    14 February 2005

2.3.1.  Incorrect Control Traffic Relaying

   If TC messages (or routing protocol control messages in general) are
   not properly relayed, connectivity loss may result. In networks where
   no redundancy exists (e.g. in a ``strip'' network), connectivity loss
   will surely result, while other topologies may provide redundant con-
   nectivity. Similarly if a node does not forward data packets (e.g. if
   intra-node forwarding is impaired), loss of connectivity may result.

2.3.2.  Replay attack

   A replay attack is, simply, where control traffic from one region of
   the network is recorded and replayed in a different region (this type
   of attack is also known as the Wormhole attack) This may, for exam-
   ple, happen when two nodes collaborate on an attack, one recording
   traffic in its proximity and tunneling it to the other node, which
   replays the traffic. In a protocol where links are discovered by
   testing reception, this will result in extraneous link creation
   (basically, a link between the two ``attacking'' nodes).

   While this may result from an attack, we note that it may also be
   intentional: if data-traffic too is relayed over the virtual link
   over the ``tunnel'', the link being detected is, indeed valid. This
   is, for instance, used in wireless repeaters. If data traffic is not
   carried over the virtual link, an imaginary, compromised, link has
   been created.

   Replay attacks can be especially damaging if coupled with spoofing
   and playing with sequence numbers in the replayed messages, poten-
   tially destroying some important topology information in nodes all
   over the network.

2.3.3.  Incorrect Data Traffic Relaying

   Even a node correctly generating, processing and forwarding control
   traffic as required, may act in a malicious way through not forward-
   ing data traffic. The node thereby breaks connectivity in the network
   (data traffic cannot get through) however this connectivity loss is
   not detected by the routing protocol (control traffic is correctly
   relayed).

   While this indeed may be due to an attack, this type of situation is
   also encountered simply due to misconfigured nodes: routing

   capabilities (through IP forwarding) are typically disabled by
   default in most operating systems, and must manually be enabled.
   Failing to do so, effectively, triggers the situation where data
   traffic is not forwarded/routed while control-traffic (which is for-
   warded by action of the routing daemon) is transmitted correctly.

1.  Introduction

   A Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET) is a collection of nodes which are
   able to connect on a wireless medium forming an arbitrary and dynamic
   network. Implicitly herein is the ability for the network topology to
   change over time as links in the network appear and disappear.

   In order to enable communication between any two nodes in such a
   MANET, a routing protocol is employed. The abstract task of the rout-
   ing protocol is to discover the topology (and, as the network is
   dynamic, continuing changes to the topology) to ensure that each node
   is able to acquire a recent image of the network topology for con-
   structing routes.

   Currently, two complementary classes of routing protocols exist in
   the MANET world. Reactive protocols acquire routes on demand through
   flooding a ``route request'' (which typically also records the path
   taken) and receiving a ``route reply'' (typically signaling the path
   taken by the route request to arrive at the destination node). I.e.
   the required parts of the topology graph is constructed in a node
   only when needed for data traffic communication. Reactive MANET rout-
   ing protocols include AODV [4] and DSR [6].

   The other class of MANET routing protocols is proactive, i.e. the
   routing protocol ensures that all nodes at all times have sufficient
   topological information to construct routes to all destinations in
   the network. This is achieved through periodic message exchange.
   Proactive MANET routing protocols include OLSR [1] and TBRPF [5].

   A significant issue in the ad-hoc domain is that of the integrity of
   the network itself. AODV, DSR, OLSR and TBRPF allow, according to
   their specifications, any node to participate in the network - the
   assumption  being that all nodes are well-behaving and welcome. If
   that assumptions fails - if the network may count malicious nodes -
   the integrity of the network may fail.

   An orthogonal security issue is that of maintaining confidentiality
   and integrity of the data being exchanged between communications end-
   points in the network (e.g. between a mail server and a mail client).
   The task of ensuring end-to-end security of data communications in
   MANETs is equivalent to that of securing end-to-end security in tra-
   ditional wire-line networks, and is not considered further in this
   draft.

   The primary issue with respect to securing MANET routing protocols is
   thus ensuring the network integrity, even in presence of malicious
   nodes. Security extensions to the reactive protocols AODV and DSR
   exist, in form of SAODV [7] and Ariadne [8]. Assuming that a

[Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT       Securing OLSR Problem Statement    14 February 2005

   mechanism for key distribution is in place, these extensions employ
   digital signatures on the route request and route reply messages. The
   basic principle being that each node verifies the signature of a mes-
   sage and - if valid - modifies the message (if applicable), signing
   it itself before forwarding the message.

   In this draft, we investigate the issues with security in proactive
   MANET routing protocols in general, and OLSR in particular.

   We point out, that there are different approaches to securing a
   proactive MANET routing protocol in general, and OLSR in particular.
   One such approach is to ensure that only ``trusted'' nodes are admit-
   ted into the network and, subsequently, that these are the only nodes
   used for forwarding traffic. This approach relies on an assumption
   that a trusted node is not, at the same time, misbehaving -- much
   like a company, handing out a key to each employee, assuming that any
   theft will be committed by people outside to the company. Complimen-
   tary to this trusted/non-trusted discrimination of nodes, is the
   ability to detect and deal with the situation where a trusted node
   has become compromised. Specifically, to take a trusted node, detect
   that it is misbehaving and then decide to classify that node as "non-
   trusted" for exclusion from the network. This, however, opens an
   additional vulnerability: a node can be malicious in that it
   "denounces" other (non-malicious) nodes and manages to get these
   excluded from the network.

   While we do not, in the present version of this draft, concern our-
   self with the solution-space, we do point out that any solutions must
   be carefully scrutinized to prevent that they themselves introduce
   other vulnerabilities.

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [5].


1.2.  Applicability

   This document aims at discussing the issues with securing proactive
   MANET routing protocols in general and OLSR in particular.

2.  Proactive MANET Routing Protocols and OLSR Vulnerabilities

   In this section, we will discuss various security vulnerabilities in
   proactive routing protocol for ad hoc networks. We will specifically
   enumerate vulnerabilities in OLSR, however we point out that this
   section does not emphasize ``flaws'' in the OLSR protocol. Rather,
   the vulnerabilities are instances of what all proactive routing pro-
   tocols are subject to.

   When an ad hoc network is operating under a proactive routing proto-
   col, each node has two different (but related) responsibilities.
   Firstly, each node must correctly generate routing protocol control
   traffic, conforming to the protocol specification. Secondly, each
   node is responsible for forwarding routing protocol control traffic
   on behalf of other nodes in the network. Thus incorrect behavior of a
   node can result from either a node generating incorrect control mes-
   sages or from incorrect relaying of control traffic from other nodes.

   Correctly generating and forwarding control traffic can be considered
   as a criterion for having a correctly functioning routing. In other
   words, that the routing protocol is able to consistently provide a
   correct view of the network topology in each network node. This
   assumption implies that all nodes in the network correctly implement
   the routing protocol - specifically that each node correctly pro-
   cesses and emits control traffic. Note that this, in and by itself,
   is not sufficient to ensure that data packets are being correctly
   routed in the network. Indeed, independently of the routing protocol
   being proactive or reactive, a misbehaving node may generate, process
   and relay control traffic correctly while actually not perform data
   traffic forwarding.

   In the remainder of this section, we will investigate how these
   incorrect behaviors may appear in OLSR. We note, that while we employ
   OLSR for the purpose of our descriptions, much of the following
   applies equally for other proactive routing protocols.

2.1.  Jamming

   One vulnerability, common for all routing protocols operating a wire-
   less ad hoc network, is that of ``jamming'' - i.e. that a node gener-
   ates massive amounts of interfering radio transmissions, which will
   prevent legitimate traffic (e.g. control traffic for the routing pro-
   tocol as well as data traffic) on part of a network. This vulnerabil-
   ity cannot be dealt with at the routing protocol level (if at all),
   leaving the network without the ability to maintain connectivity.
   Jamming is somewhat similar to that of network overload and

[Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT       Securing OLSR Problem Statement    14 February 2005

   subsequent denial of service: a sufficiently significant amount of
   routing protocol control traffic is lost, preventing routes to be
   constructed in the network.

2.2.  Incorrect Traffic Generation

   OLSR employs, basically, two different kinds of control traffic:
   HELLO messages and TC messages.  While there are other types of OLSR
   messages (such as MID or HNA), they don't introduce any fundamentally
   different issues, and we therefore concentrate on HELLOs and TCs.  
In
   this section, we will describe how a non-conforming node may affect
   the network connectivity through incorrect generation of HELLO and TC
   messages.

   In general, we observe that with respect to control traffic genera-
   tion, a node may misbehave in two different ways: through generating
   control traffic ``pretending'' to be another node (i.e. Identity
   Spoofing) or through advertising incorrect information (links) in the
   control messages (i.e. Link Spoofing). In both cases, the net effect
   is, that incorrect link-state information is introduced into the net-
   work. This incorrect information then leads to the algorithms of the
   routing protocol to operate on incorrect data-sets and, possibly,
   yield incorrect results as a concequence.

2.2.1.  Incorrect HELLO Message Generation

   In terms of HELLO messages, identity spoofing implies that a node
   sends HELLO messages pretending to have the identity of another node.
   E.g. node X sends HELLO messages with the originator address set to
   that of node A, as illustrated in Figure 1. This may result in the
   network containing conflicting routes to node A. Specifically, node X
   will choose MPRs from among its neighbors, signaling this selection
   pretending to have the identity of node A. The MPRs will, subse-
   quently, advertise that they can provide ``last hop'' to node A in
   their TC messages. Conflicting routes to node A, with possible loops,
   may result from this.

    Figure 1: Identity Spoofing of Hello messages. Node X assumes
    the identity of node A for sending HELLO messages. Node B and
    node C may subsequently announce reachability to node A through
    their TC messages.

   Similarly, link spoofing implies that a node sends HELLO messages,
   signaling an incorrect set of neighbors. This may take either of two
   forms: if the set is incomplete, i.e. a node ``ignores'' some neigh-
   bors, the network may be without connectivity to these ``ignored''
   neighbors.

   Alternatively, a compromised node advertising a neighbor-relationship
   to non-present nodes may cause inaccurate MPR selection with the
   result that some nodes may not be reachable in the network.

2.2.2.  Incorrect TC Message Generation

   As for HELLO messages, identity spoofing with respect to TC messages
   implies that a node sends TC messages, pretending to have the iden-
   tity of another node. Effectively, this implies link spoofing since a
   node assuming the identity of another node effectively advertises
   incorrect links to the network.

   Similarly, link spoofing implies that a node sends TC messages,
   advertising an incorrect set of links. This may take either of two
   forms: if the set is incomplete, i.e. a node ``ignores'' links to
   some nodes in its MPR selector set, the network may be without con-
   nectivity to these ``ignored'' neighbors - as well as to neighbors
   which are reachable only through the ``ignored'' neighbors. A node
   may also include non-existing links (i.e. links to non-neighbor
   nodes) in a TC message. This is illustrated in Figure 2. Link spoof-
   ing in TC messages may yield routing loops and conflicting routes in
   the network.

   A node could also simply fail to produce TC control traffic: a node
   may correctly generate HELLO messages, be selected as MPR by other
   nodes, and then not generate the TC messages that indicate it has MPR
   selectors. The net concequence is, that some destinations may not be
   advertised throughout the network and.

    generates incorrect TC messages, e.g. advertising
    a link between node X and node A.


2.3.  Incorrect Traffic Relaying

   Nodes in a MANET relays two types of traffic: routing protocol con-
   trol traffic and data traffic. A node may misbehave through failing
   to forward either type of traffic correctly.

2.3.1.  Incorrect Control Traffic Relaying

   If TC messages (or routing protocol control messages in general) are
   not properly relayed, connectivity loss may result. In networks where
   no redundancy exists (e.g. in a ``strip'' network), connectivity loss
   will surely result, while other topologies may provide redundant con-
   nectivity. Similarly if a node does not forward data packets (e.g. if
   intra-node forwarding is impaired), loss of connectivity may result.

2.3.2.  Replay attack

   A replay attack is, simply, where control traffic from one region of
   the network is recorded and replayed in a different region (this type
   of attack is also known as the Wormhole attack) This may, for exam-
   ple, happen when two nodes collaborate on an attack, one recording
   traffic in its proximity and tunneling it to the other node, which
   replays the traffic. In a protocol where links are discovered by
   testing reception, this will result in extraneous link creation
   (basically, a link between the two ``attacking'' nodes).

   While this may result from an attack, we note that it may also be
   intentional: if data-traffic too is relayed over the virtual link
   over the ``tunnel'', the link being detected is, indeed valid. This
   is, for instance, used in wireless repeaters. If data traffic is not
   carried over the virtual link, an imaginary, compromised, link has
   been created.

   Replay attacks can be especially damaging if coupled with spoofing
   and playing with sequence numbers in the replayed messages, poten-
   tially destroying some important topology information in nodes all
   over the network.

2.3.3.  Incorrect Data Traffic Relaying

   Even a node correctly generating, processing and forwarding control
   traffic as required, may act in a malicious way through not forward-
   ing data traffic. The node thereby breaks connectivity in the network
   (data traffic cannot get through) however this connectivity loss is
   not detected by the routing protocol (control traffic is correctly
   relayed).

   While this indeed may be due to an attack, this type of situation is
   also encountered simply due to misconfigured nodes: routing

   capabilities (through IP forwarding) are typically disabled by
   default in most operating systems, and must manually be enabled.
   Failing to do so, effectively, triggers the situation where data
   traffic is not forwarded/routed while control-traffic (which is for-
   warded by action of the routing daemon) is transmitted correctly.
