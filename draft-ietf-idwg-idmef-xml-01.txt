1. Abstract

   The purpose of the Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format
   (IDMEF) is to define data formats and exchange procedures for sharing
   information of interest to intrusion detection and response systems,
   and to the management systems which may need to interact with them.
   The goals and requirements of the IDMEF are described in [2].

   This Internet-Draft describes a proposed implementation of the data
   format component of the IDMEF, using the Extensible Markup Language
   (XML) [3] to represent the class hierarchy defined by Debar, Huang
   and Donahoo [4].  The rationale for choosing XML is explained, a
   Document Type Definition (DTD) is developed, and examples are
   provided.

   An earlier version of this implementation was reviewed, along with
   other proposed implementations, by the IDWG at its September, 1999
   and February, 2000 meetings.  At the February meeting, it was decided
   that the XML solution was best at fulfilling the IDWG requirements.
   The rationale for this decision is presented in [10].

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT,"
   "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [5].

   An "IDMEF application" is a program or program component that reads
   and/or writes messages in the format specified by this memo.

   An "IDMEF document" is a message that adheres to the requirements
   specified by this memo, and that is exchanged by two or more IDMEF
   applications.  An "IDMEF message" is another term for an "IDMEF
   document."


3. Introduction

   The Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format (IDMEF) [2] is
   intended to be a standard data format that automated intrusion
   detection systems can use to report alerts about events that they
   have deemed suspicious.  The development of this standard format will
   enable interoperability among commercial, open source, and research
   systems, allowing users to mix-and-match the deployment of these
   systems according to their strong and weak points to obtain an
   optimal implementation.

   The most obvious place to implement the IDMEF is in the data channel
   between an intrusion detection "analyzer" (or "sensor") and the
   "manager" (or "console") to which it sends alarms.  But there are
   other places where the IDMEF can be useful:

   +  a single database system that could store the results from a
      variety of intrusion detection products would make it possible for
      data analysis and reporting activities to be performed on "the
      whole picture" instead of just a part of it;

   +  an event correlation system that could accept alerts from a
      variety of intrusion detection products would be capable of
      performing more sophisticated cross-correlation and cross-
      confirmation calculations than one that is limited to a single
      product;

   +  a graphical user interface that could display alerts from a
      variety of intrusion detection products would enable the user to
      monitor all of the products from a single screen, and require him
      or her to learn only one interface, instead of several; and

   +  a common data exchange format would make it easier for different
      organizations (users, vendors, response teams, law enforcement) to
      not only exchange data, but also communicate about it.

   The diversity of uses for the IDMEF needs to be considered when

Internet-Draft               IDMEF XML DTD                  July 6, 2000


   selecting its method of implementation.


3.1 The Extensible Markup Language

   The Extensible Markup Language (XML) [4] is a simplified version of
   the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), a text markup syntax
   defined by the ISO 8879 standard.  XML is gaining widespread
   attention as a language for representing and exchanging documents and
   data on the Internet, and as the solution to most of the problems
   inherent in HyperText Markup Language (HTML).  XML was published as a
   recommendation by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) on February 10,
   1998.

   XML is a metalanguage -- a language for describing other languages --
   that enables an application to define its own markup.  XML allows the
   definition of customized markup languages for different types of
   documents and different applications.  This differs from HTML, in
   which there is a fixed set of tags with preset meanings that must be
   "adapted" for specialized uses.  Both XML and HTML use tags
   (identifiers delimited by '<' and '>') and attributes (of the form
   "name='value'").  But where "<p>" always means "paragraph" in HTML,
   it may mean "paragraph," "person," "price," or "platypus" in XML, or
   it might have no meaning at all, depending on the particular
   application.

   The publication of XML was followed by the publication of a second
   recommendation [6] by the World Wide Web Consortium, defining the use
   of namespaces in XML documents.  An XML namespace is a collection of
   names, identified by a Universal Resource Identifier (URI).  It
   allows documents of different types, that use tags with the same
   names, to be merged with no confusion.  When using namespaces, each
   tag is identified with the namespace it comes from, allowing tags
   from different namespaces with the same names to occur in the same
   document.  For example, a single document could contain both
   "usa:football" and "europe:football" tags, each with different
   meanings.

   In anticipation of the widespread use of XML namespaces, this memo
   includes the definition of the URI to be used to identify the IDMEF
   namespace.


3.2 Rationale for Implementing IDMEF in XML

   XML-based applications are being used or developed for a wide variety
   of uses, including electronic data interchange in a variety of
   fields, financial data interchange, electronic business cards,
   calendar and scheduling, enterprise software distribution, web "push"
   technology, and markup languages for chemistry, mathematics, music,
   molecular dynamics, astronomy, book and periodical publishing, web
   publishing, weather observations, real estate transactions, and many


Curry                   Expires: January 5, 2001                [Page 6]
Internet-Draft               IDMEF XML DTD                  July 6, 2000


   others.

   XML's flexibility makes it a good choice for these applications; that
   same flexibility makes it a good choice for implementing the IDMEF as
   well.  Other, more specific reasons for choosing XML to implement the
   IDMEF are:

   +  XML allows a custom language to be developed specifically for the
      purpose of describing intrusion detection alerts.  It also defines
      a standard way to extend this language, either for later revisions
      of this document ("standard" extensions), or for vendor-specific
      use ("non-standard" extensions).

   +  Software tools for processing XML documents are widely available,
      in both commercial and open source forms.  A variety of tools and
      APIs for parsing and/or validating XML are available in a variety
      of languages, including Java, C, C++, Tcl, Perl, Python, and GNU
      Emacs Lisp.  Widespread access to tools will make adoption of the
      IDMEF by product developers easier, and hopefully, faster.

   +  XML meets IDMEF Requirement 5.1, that message formats support full
      internationalization and localization.  The XML standard specifies
      support for both the UTF-8 and UTF-16 encodings of ISO 10646
      (Unicode), making IDMEF compatible with both one- and two-byte
      character sets.  XML also provides support for specifying, on a
      per-element basis, the language in which the element's content is
      written, making IDMEF easy to adapt to "Natural Language Support"
      versions of a product.

   +  XML meets IDMEF Requirement 5.2, that message formats must support
      filtering and aggregation.  XML's integration with XSL, a style
      language, allows messages to be combined, discarded, and
      rearranged.

   +  Ongoing XML development projects, in the W3C and elsewhere, will
      provide object-oriented extensions, database support, and other
      useful features.  If implemented in XML, the IDMEF immediately
      gains these features as well.

   +  XML is free, with no license, no license fees, and no royalties.


3.3 The Debar/Huang/Donahoo IDMEF Class Hierarchy

   Debar, Huang and Donahoo [4] have proposed that intrusion detection
   alerts in the IDMEF be represented by a class hierarchy.  This
   representation has several advantages:

   +  it is flexible, and capable of describing alerts to arbitrary
      levels of complexity;

   +  it is compact, and allows applications to specify only the data


Curry                   Expires: January 5, 2001                [Page 7]
Internet-Draft               IDMEF XML DTD                  July 6, 2000


      they know; and

   +  it is easy to extend, and will allow vendors to provide additional
      information about particular alerts.

   This implementation follows the Debar/Huang/Donahoo model almost
   exactly, with the following exceptions and restrictions:

   +  XML tags have the names given to the various classes in the model,
      with a few minor exceptions where changes were made to deal with
      XML scoping rules or to increase consistency with the rest of the
      implementation.

   +  XML does not support "inheritance;" tags may only be used at the
      level at which they are declared.  Subclasses are implemented by
      making the tags for those classes child tags of the tags for the
      parent classes.

   +  Some extensions have been made, represented by the following
      elements: <Heartbeat>, <AdditionalData>, <DetectTime>,
      <AnalyzerTime>, and <portlist>.

   These changes make little difference in the overall usefulness of the
   Debar/Huang/Donahoo model, or XML as an implementation language.


4. Use of XML in the IDMEF

   This section describes how some of XML's features and requirements
   will impact the IDMEF.


4.1 The IDMEF Document Prolog

   The "prolog" of an IDMEF document, that part that precedes anything
   else, consists of the XML declaration and the document type
   declaration.


4.1.1 XML Declaration

   Every XML document (and therefore every IDMEF document) starts with
   an XML declaration.  The XML declaration specifies the version of XML
   being used; it may also specify the character set being used.

   The XML declaration looks like:

       <?xml version="1.0" ?>

   If a character encoding is specified, the declaration looks like:

       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="charset" ?>


Curry                   Expires: January 5, 2001                [Page 8]
Internet-Draft               IDMEF XML DTD                  July 6, 2000



   where "charset" is the name of the character encoding in use (see
   section 4.2).  If no encoding is specified, UTF-8 is assumed.

   IDMEF documents being exchanged between IDMEF applications MUST begin
   with an XML declaration, and MUST specify the XML version in use.
   Specification of the encoding in use is RECOMMENDED.

   IDMEF applications MAY choose to omit the XML declaration internally
   to conserve space, adding it only when the message is sent to another
   destination (e.g., a web browser).  This practice is NOT RECOMMENDED
   unless it can be accomplished without loss of each message's version
   and encoding information.


4.1.2 XML Document Type Definition (DTD)

   The Document Type Definition (DTD) specifies the exact syntax of an
   XML document.  It defines the various tags that may be used in the
   document, how the tags are related to each other, which tags are
   mandatory and which are optional, and so forth.

   The IDMEF Document Type Definition is listed in its entirety in
   section 9.

   It is expected that IDMEF applications will not normally include the
   IDMEF DTD itself in their communications.  Instead, the DTD will be
   referenced in the document type declaration in the document entity
   (see below).  Such IDMEF documents will be well-formed and valid as
   defined in [3].

   Other IDMEF documents will be specified that do not include the
   document prolog (e.g., entries in an IDMEF-format database).  Such
   IDMEF documents will be well-formed but not valid.

   Generally, well-formedness implies that a document has a single
   element that contains everything else (e.g., "<book>"), and that all
   the other elements nest nicely within each other without any
   overlapping (e.g., a "chapter" does not start in the middle of
   another "chapter").

   Validity further implies that not only is the document well-formed,
   but it also follows specific rules (contained in the Document Type
   Definition) about which elements are "legal" in the document, how
   those elements nest within other elements, and so on (e.g., a
   "chapter" does not begin in the middle of a "title").  A document
   cannot be valid unless it references a DTD (see Section 4.1.4).

   XML processors are required to be able to parse any well-formed
   document, valid or not.  The purpose of validation is to make the
   processing of that document (what's done with the data after it's
   parsed) easier.  Without validation, a document may contain elements


Curry                   Expires: January 5, 2001                [Page 9]
Internet-Draft               IDMEF XML DTD                  July 6, 2000


   in nonsense order, elements "invented" by the author that the
   processing application doesn't understand, and so forth.

   IDMEF documents MUST be well-formed.  IDMEF documents SHOULD be valid
   whenever both possible and practical.


4.1.3 IDMEF DTD Formal Public Identifier

   The formal public identifier (FPI) for the Document Type Definition
   described in this memo is:

       "-//IETF//DTD RFCxxxx IDMEF v0.1//EN"

           NOTE: The "RFCxxxx" text in  the FPI value will be replaced
                 with the actual RFC number, if this memo is published
                 as an RFC.

   This FPI MUST be used in the document type declaration within an XML
   document referencing the DTD defined by this memo, as shown in the
   following section.


4.1.4 IDMEF DTD Document Type Declaration

   The document type declaration for an XML document referencing the DTD
   defined by this memo will usually be specified in one of the
   following ways:

   <!DOCTYPE idef-message PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD RFCxxxx IDMEF v0.1//EN">

   The last component of the document type declaration is the formal
   public identifier (FPI) specified in the previous section.

   <!DOCTYPE idef-message SYSTEM "/some/path/to/the/idef-message.dtd">

   The last component of the document type declaration is a URL that
   points to a copy of the Document Type Definition.

   To be valid (see above), an XML document must contain a document type
   declaration.  However, this represents significant overhead to an
   IDMEF application, both in the bandwidth it consumes as well as the
   requirements it places on the XML parser (not only to parse the
   declaration itself, but also to parse the DTD it references).

   Implementors MAY decide, therefore, to have analyzers and managers
   agree out-of-band on the particular document type definition they
   will be using (the standard one as defined here, or one with
   extensions), and then omit the document type declaration from IDMEF
   messages.  Great care must be taken in doing this however, as the
   manager may have to accept messages from analyzers using DTDs with
   different sets of extensions.

4.2 Character Data Processing in XML and IDMEF

   The XML standard requires that XML processors support the UTF-8 and
   UTF-16 encodings of ISO 10646 (Unicode), making XML compatible with
   both one- and two-byte character sets.  While many XML processing
   applications may support other character sets, only UTF-8 and UTF-16
   can be relied upon from a portability viewpoint.

   A document's XML declaration (see section 4.1.1) specifies the
   character encoding to be used in the document, as follows:

       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="charset" ?>

   where "charset" is the name of the character set, as registered with
   the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), see [7].
   
   Consistent with the XML standard, if no encoding is specified for an
   IDMEF message, UTF-8 SHALL be assumed.

   IDMEF applications MUST NOT use, and IDMEF messages MUST NOT be
   encoded in, character encodings other than UTF-8 and UTF-16.  Note
   that since ASCII is a subset of UTF-8, it MAY be used to encode IDMEF
   messages.

   Per the XML standard, IDMEF documents encoded in UTF-16 MUST begin
   with the Byte Order Mark described by ISO/IEC 10646 Annex E and
   Unicode Appendix B (the "ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE" character,
   #xFEFF).


4.2.1 Character Entity References

   Within XML documents, certain characters have special meanings in
   some contexts.  To include the actual character itself in one of
   these contexts, a special escape sequence, called an entity
   reference, must be used.

   The characters that sometimes need to be escaped, and their entity
   references, are:

       Character        Entity Reference
       ---------------------------------
           &                 &amp;
           <                 &lt;
           >                 &gt;
           "                 &quot;
           '                 &apos;

   It is RECOMMENDED that IDMEF applications use the entity reference
   form whenever writing these characters in data, to avoid any

   possibility of misinterpretation.


4.2.2 Character Code References

   Any character defined by the ISO/IEC 10646 standard may be included
   in an XML document by the use of a character reference.  A character
   reference is started with the characters '&' and '#', and ended with
   the character ';'.  Between these characters, the character code for
   the character inserted.

   If the character code is preceded by an 'x' it is interpreted in
   hexadecimal (base 16), otherwise, it is interpreted in decimal (base
   10).  For instance, the ampersand (&) is encoded as &#38; or &#x0026;
   and the less-than sign (<) is encoded as &#60; or &#x003C;.

   Any one- or two-byte character specified in the Unicode standard can
   be included in a document using this technique.


4.2.3 White Space Processing

   XML preserves white space by default.  The XML processor passes all
   white space characters to the application unchanged.  This is much
   different from HTML (and SGML), in which, although the space/no space
   distinction is meaningful, the one space/many spaces distinction is
   not.

   XML allows tags to identify the importance of white space in their
   content by using the "xml:space" attribute:

       <tagname xml:space="action">

   where "action" is either "default" or "preserve."

   If "action" is "preserve," the application MUST treat all white space
   in the tag's content as significant.  If "action" is "default," the
   application is free to do whatever it normally would with white space
   in the tag's content.

   The intent declared with the "xml:space" attribute is considered to
   apply to all attributes and content of the element where it is
   specified, unless overridden with an instance of "xml:space" on
   another element within that content.

   All IDMEF tags support the "xml:space" attribute.


4.3 Languages in XML and IDMEF

   XML allows tags to identify the language their content is written in
   by using the "xml:lang" attribute:

Internet-Draft               IDMEF XML DTD                  July 6, 2000



       <tagname xml:lang="langcode">

   where "langcode" is a language tag as described in RFC 1766 [8].

   The intent declared with the "xml:lang" attribute is considered to
   apply to all attributes and content of the element where it is
   specified, unless overridden with an instance of "xml:lang" on
   another element within that content.
   
   IDMEF applications SHOULD specify the language in which their
   contents are encoded; in general this can be done by specifying the
   "xml:lang" attribute for the top-level <idef-message> tag.

   If no language is specified for an IDMEF message, English SHALL be
   assumed.

   All IDMEF tags support the "xml:lang" attribute.


4.4 Unrecognized Tags in IDMEF Messages

   On occasion, an IDMEF application may receive a well-formed, or even
   well-formed and valid, IDMEF message containing tags that it does not
   understand.  The tags may be either:

   +  Recognized as "legitimate" (a valid document), but the application
      does not know the semantic meaning of the tag's content; or

   +  Not recognized at all.

   IDMEF applications MUST continue to process IDMEF messages that
   contain unknown tags, provided that such messages meet the
   well-formedness requirement of section 4.1.2.  It is up to the
   individual application to decide how to process any content from the
   unknown tag(s).
   

4.5 Digital Signatures

   The joint IETF/W3C XML Signature Working Group is currently working
   to specify XML digital signature processing rules and syntax [12].
   XML Signatures provide integrity, message authentication, and/or
   signer authentication services for data of any type, whether located
   within the XML that includes the signature or elsewhere.

   The IDMEF requirements document assigns responsibility for message
   integrity and authentication to the communications protocol, not the
   message format.  However, in situations where IDMEF messages are
   exchanged over other, less secure protocols, or in cases where the
   digital signatures must be archived for later use, the inclusion of
   digital signatures within an IDMEF message itself may be desirable.

   Specifications for the use of digital signatures within IDMEF
   messages is outside the scope of this document.  However, use of the
   XML Signature standard is RECOMMENDED if such functionality is
   needed.


5. IDMEF Data Types

   XML is a typeless language; everything is simply a stream of bytes,
   and it is left to the application to extract meaning from them.

   That being said, this specification makes the following rules to
   allow interoperabity in interpreting IDMEF documents:

   1.  Integer data MUST be encoded in either Base 10 or Base 16.  Base
       10 encoding uses the digits '0' through '9' and an optional sign
       ('+' or '-').  Base 16 encoding uses the digits '0' through '9'
       and 'a' through 'f' (or their upper case equivalents), and is
       preceded by the characters "0x".  For example, the number one
       hundred twenty-three would be encoded as "123" in Base 10, or
       "0x7b" in Base 16.

   2.  Floating-point (real) data MUST be encoded in Base 10.  The
       encoding is that of the POSIX strtod() function: an optional sign
       ('+' or '-') followed by a non-empty sequence of digits
       optionally containing a radix character, then an optional
       exponent part.  An exponent part consists of an 'e' or 'E',
       followed by an optional sign, followed by one or more decimal
       digits.

   3.  Character and character string data does not require quoting, as
       the IDMEF tags provide that functionality.

   3.  Dates, as used in the <date> element, MUST be encoded as a
       four-digit year, two-digit month, and two-digit day, separated by
       dashes.  The two-digit day and its corresponding dash MAY be
       omitted to represent an entire month.  For example, March 13,
       2000 would be encoded as "2000-03-13", and December, 1999 would
       be encoded as "1999-12".

   4.  Time of day, as used in the <time> element, MUST be encoded as a
       two-digit hour, two-digit minutes, and two-digit seconds,
       separated by colons.  The two-digit seconds and corresponding
       colon MAY be omitted to represent times with less precision.  The
       seconds field MAY be followed by a decimal point and fractional
       number of seconds, if more precision is needed.  All times MUST
       be specified on a 24-hour clock.  For example, 6:00 P.M. would be
       encoded as "18:00", 3:15:27 A.M. would be encoded as "03:15:27",
       and two-tenths of a second past midnight would be encoded as
       "00:00:00.2".

   5.  NTP timestamps, as used in the <ntpstamp> element, are described
       in detail in [11].  NTP timestamps are represented as a 64-bit
       unsigned fixed-point number containing seconds relative to 0h on
       1 January 1900.  The integer part is in the first 32 bits and the
       fraction part in the last 32 bits.  Within IDMEF messages, these
       timestamps MUST be encoded as two 32-bit hexadecimal values,
       separated by a period ("."), for example, "0x123.0x456".

   6.  Port lists, as used in the <portlist> element, are encoded as a
       comma-separated list of numbers (individual integers) and ranges
       (N-M means ports N through M, inclusive).  Any combination of
       numbers and ranges may be used in a single list.  For example:
       5-25,37,42,43,53,69-119,123-514.

   7.  The identification numbers used with the "sourceid" attribute of
       the <Source> element, the "targetid" attribute of the <Target>
       element, and the "ident" attribute of the <Address>, <Node>,
       <Process>, <Service> and <User> elements MUST be unique for each
       particular combination of elements and sub-elements.  Each time
       the same entity is identified in the same way, this number SHOULD
       be the same.  Note, though, that if the same entity is identified
       in two different ways (e.g., once by host name and once by IP
       address), two different id numbers MUST be generated.  A value
       of 0 indicates that the analyzer is not capable of identifying
       these entities uniquely.

       (An easy, albeit overly complex, way to accomplish this would be
       to compute the cryptographic checksum of the element and its
       sub-elements.)

       The above does not apply to the "alertid" attribute of the
       <Alert> element, the "heartbeatid" attribute of the <Heartbeat>
       element, or the "ident" attribute of the <Analyzer> attribute,
       which have different rules.


6. Structure of an IDMEF Message

   This section describes the individual elements and attributes that
   make up an IDMEF message.  It is organized in a somewhat "top down"
   manner, in that the more significant elements are described first,
   followed by the less significant ones.

   A description of the element is provided, followed by a list of the
   element's attributes, and then a list of the sub-elements that the
   element may contain.

   For attributes, the notation "required" indicates that a value for
   the attribute must be specified, while "optional" indicates that a
   value is not required.  All optional attributes have default values
   that the manager (XML parser) will assume if no other value is
   provided.

Internet-Draft               IDMEF XML DTD                  July 6, 2000



   For sub-elements, the number of times the element may occur is given.
   Possible values are "exactly one," "zero or one," "zero or more," and
   "one or more."  Except as stated otherwise, sub-elements must occur
   in the order shown.


6.1 The IDMEF-Message Root Element

   An IDMEF message (document) contains one or more alerts and other
   message types (see below).  The <IDMEF-Message> element represents
   this; all other elements are sub-elements of <IDMEF-Message>.  Put
   another way, <IDMEF-Message> is the root element of an IDMEF
   document.

   The <IDMEF-Message> element has one attribute:

   version
        Optional.  The version of the IDMEF message specification this
        message conforms to; messages conforming to the format described
        in this memo MUST use "0.1" as the value for this attribute.

   The <IDMEF-Message> element may contain the following sub-elements,
   in any order:

   <Alert>
        Zero or more.  Description of an intrusion detection alert.  The
        data model specifies the contents of this element type.

   <Heartbeat>
        Zero or more.  Data about the "health" of the analyzer.  This is
        an extension element, not specified in the data model.


6.2 The Message Type Elements

   There are two types of IDMEF message: <Alert>, and <Heartbeat>.
   These elements are sub-elements of the <IDMEF-Message> element.

6.2.1 Alert

   The <Alert> element is used to describe an alert.  It contains the
   name of the analyzer that generated the alert, the event that caused
   the alert to be generated, and information about the source(s) and
   target(s) of the event.

   The <Alert> element has the following attributes:

   alertid
        Required.  A serial number for the alert.  This number MUST be
        unique for every alert generated by a given analyzer.  The
        default value is 0, which indicates that the analyzer cannot

   version
        Required.  The version of the class hierarchy used.  Messages
        conforming to the format described in this memo MUST use "1" as
        the value for this attribute.

   The <Alert> element has the following sub-elements:

   <Time>
        Exactly one.  The time the alert was generated.

   <Analyzer>
        Exactly one.  The analyzer sending the alert.

   <Classification>
        One or more.  The name of the vulnerability (event causing the
        alert).

   <Source>
        Zero or more.  The source(s) of the event/attack.

   <Target>
        Zero or more.  The target(s) of the event/attack.

   <ToolAlert>
        Zero or one.  Information about the tool that caused the event.

   <OverflowAlert>
        Zero or one.  Information about buffer-overflow events.

   <CorrelationAlert>
        Zero or one.  Identifies the alerts used in the correlation.

   <AdditionalData>
        Zero or more.  Additional information provided.


6.2.1.1 CorrelationAlert

   The <CorrelationAlert> sub-element of <Alert> is used to provide
   additional information about alert correlation activities.  It has
   one sub-element:

   <alertid>
        One or more.  The "alertid" strings of the alerts that were used
        by the correlation engine to generate this alert.


6.2.1.2 OverflowAlert

   The <OverflowAlert> sub-element of <Alert> is used to provide
   additional information when the alert is the result of a buffer
   overflow attack.  It has three sub-elements:

   <program>
        Exactly one.  The program that the overflow attempted to run.

   <size>
        Exactly one.  The size, in bytes, of the overflowing buffer.

   <buffer>
        Zero or one.  Some or all of the data that was sent to the
        program.

6.2.1.3 ToolAlert

   The <ToolAlert> sub-element of <Alert> is used to provide additional
   information when the analyzer recognizes the use of a particular
   attack tool or Trojan horse.  This may allow the analyzer to group
   alerts it has already received into a single "meta-alert" for display
   purposes.  <ToolAlert> has three sub-elements:

   <name>
        Exactly one.  The reason for grouping the alerts, e.g., the name
        of an attack tool.

   <command>
        Zero or one.  The command or operation the tool was asked to
        perform.

   <alertid>
        Zero or more.  The alerts that have been identified as being
        related to the name.


6.2.2 Heartbeat

   The <Heartbeat> element is used by an analyzer to provide status to a
   manager.  In its simplest form, the heartbeat simply indicates to the
   manager that the analyzer is still up and running.  In more complex
   forms, it can be used to communicate information such as restarts,
   ruleset reloads, disk and/or memory consumption statistics, and so
   on.

   The <Heartbeat> element has the following attribute:

   heartbeatid
        Required.  A serial number for the heartbeat.  This string
        SHOULD be unique for every heartbeat generated by a given
        analyzer.  It MUST NOT be possible to confuse a "heartbeatid"
        with an "alertid" from the same analyzer.

   The <Heartbeat> element has the following sub-elements:

   <Time>
        Exactly one.  The time the heartbeat was generated.

   <Analyzer>
        Exactly one.  The analyzer sending the heartbeat.

   <AdditionalData>
        Zero or more.  Additional information provided.  See Examples
        7.4 and 7.7 for suggested usage.

6.3 Time Elements

   The IDMEF data model provides for one piece of time data, the alert
   generation time.  This specification extends that, adding the event
   detection time (which, especially in the case of correlation, may be
   quite different from the alert generation time), and current analyzer
   time.


6.3.1 Time

   The <Time> element provides the time the alert or heartbeat was sent
   by the analyzer.

   The <Time> element has the following attribute:

   offset
        Optional.  Specifies the offset from Coordinated Universal Time
        (UTC, formerly referred to as "Greenwich Mean Time") that the
        <date> and <time> elements represent.  A "+" or "-" indicates
        whether the <time> is ahead of (i.e., east of) or behind (i.e.,
        west of) Universal Time.  The first two digits indicate the
        number of hours difference from Universal Time, and the last two
        digits indicate the number of minutes difference from Universal
        Time.  (Hence, "+hhmm" means +(hh * 60 + mm) minutes, and
        "-hhmm" means -(hh * 60 + mm) minutes).  The form "+0000" SHOULD
        be used to indicate a time zone at Universal Time.  Though
        "-0000" also indicates Universal Time, it is used to indicate
        that the time was generated on a system that may be in a local
        time zone other than Universal Time and therefore indicates that
        the <date>/<time> contains no information about the local time
        zone.  Default value: "+0000".

   The <Time> element has the following sub-elements:

   <ntpstamp>
        Exactly one.  The NTP timestamp.  See Section 5 for formatting
        details.

   <date>
        Exactly one.  The date.  See Section 5 for formatting details.

   <time>
        Exactly one.  The time.  See Section 5 for formatting details.

   <DetectTime>
        Zero or one.  The time the event was detected.

   <AnalyzerTime>

   In the event of a discrepancy between the time contained in the
   <ntpstamp> element and the time contained in the <date> and <time>
   elements, the time in the <ntpstamp> element shall prevail.


6.3.2 DetectTime

   The <DetectTime> element provides the time the event that generated
   this alert was detected.  This may be quite different from the time
   the alert was generated.

   The <DetectTime> element has one attribute, "offset," and three
   sub-elements, <ntpstamp>, <date>, and <time>, as described in Section
   6.3.1, above.
   

6.3.3 AnalyzerTime

   The <AnalyzerTime> element provides the current date and time on the
   analyzer.  By comparing this to its own date and time, a manager can
   compute an "adjustment" to the other times in this element,
   compensating for unsynchronized clocks.

   The <AnalyzerTime> element has one attribute, "offset," and three
   sub-elements, <ntpstamp>, <date>, and <time>, as described in Section
   6.3.1, above.


6.4 High-Level Entity Identification Elements

   There are three "high-level" entities in the IDMEF model: analyzers,
   sources, and targets.  The elements described in this section are
   used to contain the identification of those entities.


6.4.1 Analyzer

   The <Analyzer> element contains all the information that describes
   the analyzer sending the current message.  Only one analyzer may be
   encoded for each alert.  The data model does not provide a way to
   record a "stream" of analyzers (as would occur in a hierarchical
   intrusion detection system, where alerts get relayed up the tree).
   The data model does not prevent this architecture, but it doesn't
   provide any way to keep track of the relays along the path from the
   analyzer to the manager that ultimately receives the alert.

   The <Analyzer> element has the following attribute:

   ident
        Required.  Analyzer identification token.  This token MUST be
        unique within the communicating analyzers and managers.

   The <Analyzer> element has the following sub-elements:

   <Node>
        Zero or one.  Identification of the equipment on which the
        analyzer resides.

   <Process>
        Zero or one.  Process information concerning the analyzer.


6.4.2 Source

   The <Source> element contains all the information about the source of
   an event.  An event may have multiple sources (e.g., in the case of a
   distributed denial-of-service attack).

   The <Source> element has the following attributes:

   sourceid
        Optional.  See Section 5 for formatting details.

   spoofed
        Required.  An indication of whether the analyzer believes this
        to be the true source of the event.  Possible values:

        | no                    | This is the true source.
        +-----------------------+---------------------------------------

    The <Source> element has the following sub-elements:

   <Node>
        Zero or one.  Host/device name and address information.

   <User>
        Zero or one.  User information.

   <Process>
        Zero or one.  Process information.


6.4.3 Target

   The <Target> element contains all the information about the target of
   an event.  An event may have multiple targets (e.g., in the case of a
   port sweep).

   The <Target> element has the following attributes:

   targetid
        Optional.  See Section 5 for formatting details.

   decoy
        Required.  An indication of whether the analyzer believes this

6.7.1 AdditionalData

   The <AdditionalData> element is used to provide arbitrary information
   in an alert or heartbeat that does not "fit" anywhere else in the
   message.

   The <AdditionalData> element has two attributes:

   meaning
        Optional.  A string that describes the meaning of the data in
        this element.  These strings will be implementation-dependent.

   type
        Optional.  The type of the data in this element.  Possible
        values:

        +-----------------------+---------------------------------------
        | unknown               | No type given.  Default value.
        +-----------------------+---------------------------------------
        | boolean               | True/false or yes/no
        +-----------------------+---------------------------------------
        | byte                  | A single byte
        +-----------------------+---------------------------------------
        | character             | A single character
        +-----------------------+---------------------------------------
        | date                  | A date string formatted as per
        |                       | Section 5
        +-----------------------+---------------------------------------
        | integer               | An integer
        +-----------------------+---------------------------------------
        | ntpstamp              | An NTP timestamp as per Section 5
        +-----------------------+---------------------------------------
        | real                  | A floating-point number

   sub-element of the <Alert> and <Heartbeat> elements.


7. Examples

   The examples shown in this section demonstrate how the IDMEF is used
   to encode alert data.  The first eight examples are taken from [4],
   and show how the IDMEF format relates to the Debar/Huang/Donahoo
   class hierarchy.

   These examples are for demonstration purposes only.  They do not

   particular alert, and should not be construed as guidelines on how
   particular alerts should be classified.

7.3 Local Attacks

   The following examples show how some common local host attacks could
   be represented in the IDMEF.


7.3.1 The "loadmodule" Attack

   Host-based detection of the "loadmodule" exploit.  This attack
   involves tricking the "loadmodule" program to run another program;
   since "loadmodlue" is set-user-id "root," the executed program runs
   with super-user privileges.  Note the use of the <User> and <Process>
   elements to identify the user attempting the exploit and how he's
   doing it.

8. Extending the IDMEF

   There are four ways to extend the IDMEF:

   1. The <AdditionalData> element (see Section 6.7.1) can be used to
      include arbitrary data in an <Alert> or <Heartbeat>.  This


Curry                   Expires: January 5, 2001               [Page 45]
Internet-Draft               IDMEF XML DTD                  July 6, 2000


      approach SHOULD be used whenever possible.

   2. The IDMEF DTD will allow additional values to be added to certain
      attributes by redefining the "ext.attvals.Listname" parameterized
      entity reference (see below).  This approach MAY be used, with the
      caveat that extensions may not be understood by all analyzers or
      managers.

   3. The IDMEF DTD will allow additional attributes to be added to any
      element by redefining the "ext.attlist.Elementname" parameterized
      entity reference (see below).  This approach MAY be used, with the
      caveat that extensions may not be understood by all analyzers or
      managers.

   4. XML will allow the DTD to be extended by declaring additional
      elements, entities, and attributes in the document type
      declaration.  This approach SHOULD NOT be used unless the
      alternatives above are unworkable.

   This section briefly describes how to extend the IDMEF using methods
   (2), (3), and (4) above.


8.1 Extending an Existing Attribute

   Many attributes in the IDMEF DTD have a pre-defined list of values
   that the attributes may take on.  The "category" attributes of the
   <Address>, <Node>, and <User> elements are examples of this.

   The IDMEF DTD provides a standard way to extend the list of allowed
   values for these attributes by redefining the already-defined
   "ext.attvals.Listname" parameterized entity (where "Listname" is the
   name of the attribute value list -- see the DTD for the actual
   names).  Initially, this entity is defined as the empty string:

        <!ENTITY % ext.attvals.Listname         "">

   To add two new attribute values called "x-value-1" and "x-value-2" to
   the "Listname" list of values, this would be redefined as follows:

        <!ENTITY % ext.attvals.Listname         "
                | x-value-1 | x-value-2
          ">

   This redefinition is made at the time the document type is declared,
   through the document type declaration (see Section 4.1.4):

   <!DOCTYPE IDMEF-Message PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD RFCxxxx IDMEF v0.1//EN"
     "idmef-message.dtd"
   [
   <!ENTITY % ext.attvals.Listname              "
        | x-value-1 | x-value-2


Curry                   Expires: January 5, 2001               [Page 46]
Internet-Draft               IDMEF XML DTD                  July 6, 2000


   ">
   ]>

   All new attribute values defined in this manner MUST have names that
   begin with "x-".  They SHOULD also include the name of their creator
   in the name, e.g., "x-acme-specialvalue."


8.2 Adding an Attribute

   Every element in the IDMEF DTD has an attribute list associated with
   it.  At a minimum, this list contains the "xml:lang" and "xml:space"
   attributes.  Many elements also have particular attributes associated
   with them, as described in Section 6.

   The IDMEF DTD provides a standard way to extend the attribute list
   for a particular element by redefining the already-defined
   "ext.attlist.Elementname" parameterized entity (where "Elementname"
   is the name of the element to which the attribute is to be added).
   Initially, this entity is defined as the empty string:

        <!ENTITY % ext.attlist.Elementname      "">

   To add a new attribute called "x-attribute" to the "Elementname"
   element, this would be redefined as follows:

        <!ENTITY % ext.attlist.Elementname      "
            x-attribute         CDATA           #IMPLIED
          ">

   This declares the attribute as an optional attribute that may have
   any value (other possibilities, such as required attributes, a
   default value, or a fixed set of values, are also possible -- see a
   text on XML for details).

   This redefinition is made at the time the document type is declared,
   through the document type declaration (see Section 4.1.4):

   <!DOCTYPE IDMEF-Message PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD RFCxxxx IDMEF v0.1//EN"
     "idmef-message.dtd"
   [
   <!ENTITY % ext.attlist.Elementname   "
       x-attribute              CDATA           #IMPLIED
    ">
   ]>

   All new attributes defined in this manner MUST have names that begin
   with "x-".  They SHOULD also include the name of their creator in the
   name, e.g., "x-acme-specialattr."  Required attributes (those marked
   "#REQUIRED") SHOULD be avoided, as it may not be possible to cause an
   analyzer to generate that attribute.



Curry                   Expires: January 5, 2001               [Page 47]
Internet-Draft               IDMEF XML DTD                  July 6, 2000


   Existing IDMEF element attributes MAY NOT be redefined.


8.3 Adding an Element

   To add a new element, the new element is defined inside the document
   type declaration, as above.  However, the definitions of one or more
   existing elements must also be modified, to "plug in" the new element
   in the right places.

   The example below shows how to add a new element.  In this case, a
   new IDMEF message type, "x-acme-error," is added:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   
   <!DOCTYPE idef-message PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD RFCxxxx IDMEF v0.1//EN"
     "idef-message.dtd"
   [
   <!ELEMENT IDMEF-Message                      (
       (Alert | Heartbeat | x-acme-error)*
     )>
   <!ELEMENT x-acme-error (#PCDATA) >
   ]>

   All new elements defined in this manner MUST have names that begin
   with "x-".  They SHOULD also include the name of their creator in the
   name, e.g., "x-acme-specialelem."

   Any additions made in this manner MUST NOT change the existing IDMEF
   document structure as defined in this specification (i.e., elements
   may not be deleted or resequenced).

   This Internet-Draft describes a data format for the exchange of
   security-related data between security product implementations.
   There are no security considerations directly applicable to the
   format of this data.  There may, however, be security considerations
   associated with the transport protocol chosen to move this data
   between communicating entities.
