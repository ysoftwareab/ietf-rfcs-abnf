Abstract

   This Internet Draft offers seven MODP ?Diffie-Hellman? groups which
   can be used in conjunction with other IETF standards to provide
   security for Internet communications.  The groups are designed to
   allow implementers to use the same groups with different security
   protocols such as SMIME, SSH, TLS and IKE.  The prime numbers which
   form part of the definition of these groups are designed to allow
   for fast, small signatures and be of the correct form for compliance
   with standards bodies such as ANSI, NIST and the IEEE.  This draft
   includes groups with bit sizes of 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096, 6144, and
   8192. These may be used in addition to the groups already specified
   or in place of them. Since these groups are acceptable for all 
   cryptographic applications involving the difficulty of discrete 
   logarithms over GF(p) they are referred to as "universal" groups.

1 Introduction

   Numerous IETF and other security protocols call for the use of MODP 
   groups to provide security for key exchanges, digital signatures and
   proofs of possession.  However some standards specifying these 
   protocols call for the use of primes structured so they cannot be 
   effectively used in other protocols. This situation forces
   vendors which implement several different security protocols in their
   device to implement several different MODP groups when there is no
   compelling security reason to do so.  For instance the primes 
   suggested for use with the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) [RFC2409]are 
   not suitable for use in applications using the Digital Signature 
   Standard [DSS]and related cryptographic mechanisms.

   While primes of some forms may or may not be appropriate for use with
   one or another protocols, primes of the form required by the Digital
   Signature Standard [DSS] are appropriate for all IETF protocols, both
   existing and in development.  In particular, the Transport Layer 
   Security Protocol Version 1 [RFC2246] and its successor Version 1.1
   envision using the same prime for both digital signatures and 
   Diffie-Hellman key exchanges in TLS. 

   Outside the IETF, the US Government's National Institute for 
   Standards and Technology (NIST), which developed the Digital 
   Signature Standard, is developing a "Recommendation on Key 
   Establishment Schemes" [NIST-800-56] which will require primes of 
   DSS form for Diffie-Hellman key exchanges.  Once adopted, conformance
   with this standard will be required in order to receive certification 
   under NIST's FIPS-140-2, "Security Requirements for Cryptographic 
   Modules" [FIPS-140]. Such certification is required for sales to the 
   US and Canadian governments and may be required by other governments 
   and organizations as the FIPS-140 standard is migrated into the 
   Intenational Standards Organization (ISO).

   By utilizing a set of standardized primes suitable for all protocols,
   vendors can avoid having to implement many different MODP groups and
   can expend greater effort in optimizing the performance of a common
   set of suitable primes.

2 DSS Prime Structure

   The structure of primes specified in the Digital Signature Standard
   was selected to allow for fast signature creation and verification.
   Likewise the MODP groups defined by these groups put explicit 
   requirements on the size of the group and on the size of the 
   exponents used.  
 


Takahashi                                                       [Page 2]
Internet Draft                                          October 18, 2003


   This helps ensure the security of protocols using these groups as 
   well as their efficiency. The Digital Signature Standard defines
   the following parameters:

   p = a prime modulus 

   q = a divisor of p-1

   g = an element of order q in GF(p) 

   The DSS specifies that p be 1024 bits in length and q be 160 bits in
   in length.  However, this limitation is removed in the ANSI and IEEE
   specifications for the DSS. Likewise, the draft NIST publication on
   Key Establishment schemes provides a wider range of compliant p and q
   values.  Specifically, NIST provides for p and q values of (1024,
   2048, 3072, 8192) and (160, 224, 256, 384) bit sizes respectively. The q       
   values listed are the minimum values required.  This document includes more
   possibilities for p and provides q values which are more conservative
   than those presented by NIST.  Specifically, the following Universal
   MODP groups are presented:

   Length of p (in bits):  1024  1536  2048  3072  4096  6144  8192
   Length of q (in bits):   160   192   256   288   320   352   384

   By making the value q much smaller than p, computations in the DSS
   are faster and the signature size smaller than if q were close to
   p in size.

10 Security Considerations  

   The strength of a key derived from a Diffie-Hellman exchange using
   any of the groups defined here depends on the inherent strength of
   the group, the size of the exponent used, and the entropy provided by
   the random number generator used. The groups defined in this 
   document were chosen to make the work factor for solving the 
   discrete logarithm problem roughly comparable to an attack on the
   subgroup.

11 IANA Considerations

   This document contains group numbers to be maintained by the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). These numbers (19-25)
   were chosen to avoid collisions with other specifications.
   IKE [RFC-2409] defines 4 Diffie-Hellman Groups, numbered 1 through 4.
   RFC-3526 defines 6 more groups numbered 5, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18. 
   This document defines 7 more groups which can be numbers 19 to 25.
