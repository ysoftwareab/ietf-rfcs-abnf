  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The goals of this specification are:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>To create a simple incremental mechanism to provide reliable PIM message delivery in PIM version 2 for use with PIM Sparse-Mode <a href="#RFC4601">[RFC4601]</a> (including Source-Specific Multicast) and Bidirectional PIM <a href="#RFC5015">[RFC5015]</a>.</li>
<li>The reliable transport mechanism will be used for Join-Prune message transmission only.</li>
<li>When a router supports this specification, it need not use the reliable transport mechanism with every neighbor.  It can be negotiated on a per neighbor basis.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">The explicit non-goals of this specification are:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Changes to the PIM message formats as defined in <a href="#RFC4601">[RFC4601]</a>.</li>
<li>Provide support for automatic switching between the reliable transport mechanism and the regular PIM mechanism defined in <a href="#RFC4601">[RFC4601]</a>.  Two routers that are PIM neighbors on a link will always use the reliable transport mechanism if and only if both have enabled support for the reliable transport mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">This document will specify how periodic Join/Prune message transmission can be eliminated by using TCP <a href="#RFC0793">[RFC0793]</a> or SCTP <a href="#RFC4960">[RFC4960]</a> as the reliable transport mechanism for Join/Prune messages.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">This specification enables greater scalability in terms of control traffic overhead. However, for routers connected to multi-access links that comes at the price of increased control plane state overhead and the control plane overhead required to maintain this state.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">In many existing and emerging networks, particularly wireless and mobile satellite systems, link degradation due to weather, interference, and other impairments can result in temporary spikes in the packet loss. In these environments, periodic PIM joining can cause join latency when messages are lost causing a retransmission only 60 seconds later. By applying a reliable transport, a lost join is retransmitted rapidly. Furthermore, when the last user leaves a multicast group, any lost prune is similarly repaired and the multicast stream is quickly removed from the wireless/satellite link. Without a reliable transport, the multicast transmission could otherwise continue until it timed out, roughly 3 minutes later.  As network resources are at a premium in many of these environments, rapid termination of the multicast stream is critical for maintaining efficient use of bandwidth.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">PIM Over Reliable Transport (PORT) is a simple extension to PIMv2 for refresh reduction of PIM Join/Prune messages. It involves sending incremental rather than periodic Join/Prune messages over a TCP/SCTP connection between PIM neighbors.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">PORT only applies to PIM Sparse-Mode <a href="#RFC4601">[RFC4601]</a> and Bidirectional PIM <a href="#RFC5015">[RFC5015]</a> Join/Prune messages.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">This document does not restrict PORT to any specific link types.  However, the use of PORT on e.g. multi-access LANs with many PIM neighbors should be carefully evaluated. This due to the fact that there may be a full mesh of PORT connections, and that explicit tracking of all PIM PORT routers is required.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.4">PORT can be incrementally used on a link between PORT capable neighbors. Routers that are not PORT capable can continue to use PIM in Datagram Mode. PORT capability is detected using new PORT Capable PIM Hello Options.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.5">Once PORT is enabled on an interface and a PIM neighbor also announces that it is PORT enabled, only PORT Join/Prune messages will be used. That is, only PORT Join/Prune messages are accepted from, and sent to, that particular neighbor. Native Join/Prune messages are still used for PIM neighbors that are not PORT enabled.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.6">PORT Join/Prune messages are sent using a TCP/SCTP connection.  When two PIM neighbors are PORT enabled, both for TCP or both for SCTP, they will immediately, or on-demand, establish a connection. If the connection goes down, they will again immediately, or on-demand, try to reestablish the connection.  No Join/Prune messages (neither Native nor PORT) are sent while there is no connection. Also, any received native Join/Prune messages from that neighbor are discarded, even when the connection is down.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.7">When PORT is used, only incremental Join/Prune messages are sent from downstream routers to upstream routers. As such, downstream routers do not generate periodic Join/Prune messages for state for which the RPF neighbor is PORT-capable.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.8">For Joins and Prunes, which are received over a TCP/SCTP connection, the upstream router does not start or maintain timers on the outgoing interface entry. Instead, it keeps track of which downstream routers have expressed interest. An interface is deleted from the outgoing interface list only when all downstream routers on the interface, no longer wish to receive traffic. If there also are native joins/prunes from non-PORT neighbor, then one can maintain timers on the outgoing interface entry as usual, while at the same time keep track of each of the downstream PORT joins/prunes.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.9">This document does not update the PIM Join/Prune packet format.  However, for Join/Prune messages sent over TCP/SCTP connections, only what would be the IP payload of a native PIM Join/Prune is included, there is no IP Header.  Each message is contained in a PORT message.  See section <a href="#PM">Section 5</a> for details on the PORT message.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.1">All Hello messages containing PIM-over-TCP Capable or PIM-over-SCTP Capable hello options, MUST also contain the Interface ID hello option <a href="#I-D.ietf-pim-hello-intid">[I-D.ietf-pim-hello-intid]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.2">The Interface ID is used to associate a PORT Join/Prune message with the PIM neighbor that it is coming from.  When unnumbered interfaces are used or when a single Transport connection is used for sending and receiving Join/Prune messages over multiple interfaces, the Interface ID is used to convey the interface from Join/Prune message sender to Join/Prune message receiver. The value of the Interface ID hello option in Hellos sent on an interface, MUST be the same as the Interface ID value in all PORT Join/Prune messages sent to a PIM neighbor on that interface.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.3">The Interface ID need only uniquely identify an interface of a router, it does not need to identify which router the interface belongs to. This means that the Router ID part of the Interface ID MAY be 0. For details on the Router ID and the value 0, see <a href="#I-D.ietf-pim-hello-intid">[I-D.ietf-pim-hello-intid]</a>.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> Establishing Transport Connections</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">While a router interface is PORT enabled, a PIM-over-TCP or a PIM-over-SCTP option MUST be included in the PIM Hello messages sent on that interface. When a router on a PORT-enabled interface receives a Hello message containing a PIM-over-TCP/PIM-over-SCTP Option from a new neighbor, or an existing neighbor that did not previously include the option, it switches to PORT mode for that particular neighbor.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">When a router switches to PORT mode for a neighbor, it stops sending and accepting Native Join/Prune messages for that neighbor.  Any state from previous Native Join/Prune messages is left to expire as normal. It will also attempt to establish a Transport connection (TCP or SCTP) with the neighbor. If both the router and its neighbor have announced both PIM-over-TCP and PIM-over-SCTP options, SCTP MUST be used. This resolves the issue where two transports are both offered. The method prefers SCTP over TCP, because SCTP has benefits such as call collision handling and support for multiple streams, as discussed later in this document.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.3">When the router is using TCP, it will compare the TCP Connection ID it announced in the PIM-over-TCP Capable Option with the TCP Connection ID in the Hello received from the neighbor. Unless connections are opened on-demand (see below), the router with the lower Connection ID MUST do an active Transport open to the neighbor Connection ID. The router with the higher Connection ID MUST do a passive Transport open.  An implementation MAY open connections only on-demand, in that case it may be that the neighbor with the higher Connection ID does the active open, see <a href="#ondemand">Section 4.5</a>. If the router with the lower Connection ID chooses to only do an active open on-demand, it MUST do a passive open, allowing for the neighbor to initiate the connection.  Note that the source address of the active open MUST be the announced Connection ID.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.4">When the router is using SCTP, the IP address comparison need not be done since the SCTP protocol can handle call collision.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.5">If PORT is used both for IPv4 and IPv6, both IPv4 and IPv6 PIM Hello messages MUST be sent, both containing PORT Hello options.  If two neighbors announce the same transport (TCP or SCTP) and the same Connection ID in the IPv4 and IPv6 Hello messages, then only one connection is established and is shared. Otherwise, two connections are established and are used separately.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.6">The PIM router that performs the active open initiates the connection with a locally generated source transport port number and a well-known destination transport port number. The PIM router that performs the passive open listens on the well-known local transport port number and does not qualify the remote transport port number. See <a href="#PM">Section 5</a> for well-known port number assignment for PORT.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.7">When a Transport connection is established (or reestablished), the two routers MUST both send a full set of Join/Prune messages for state for which the other router is the upstream neighbor. This is needed to ensure that the upstream neighbor has the correct state. When moving from Datagram mode, or when the connection has gone down, the router cannot be sure that all the previous Join/Prune state was received by the neighbor. Any state created before the connection was established (or reestablished) that is not refreshed, MUST be left to expire and be deleted. When the non-refreshed state has expired and been deleted, the two neighbors will be in sync.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.8">It is possible that a router starts sending Hello messages with a new Connection ID, e.g. due to configuration changes.  A router MUST always use the last announced and last seen Connection IDs. A connection is identified by the local Connection ID (the one we are announcing on a particular interface), and the remote Connection ID (the one we are receiving from a neighbor on the same interface). When either the local or remote ID changes, the Connection ID pair we need a connection for changes. There may be an existing connection with the same pair, in which case the router will share that connection. Or a new connection may need to be established. Note that for link-local addresses, the interface should be regarded as part of the ID, so that connection sharing is not attempted when the same link-local addresses are seen on different interfaces.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.9">When a Connection ID changes, if the previously used connection is not needed (there are no other PIM neighborships using the same Connection ID pair), both peers MUST attempt to reset the transport connection. Next (even if the old connection is still needed), they MUST, unless a connection already exists with the new Connection ID pair, immediately or on-demand attempt to establish a new connection with the new Connection ID pair.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.10">Normally the Interface ID would not change while a connection is up. However, if it does, it does not affect the connection.  It just means that when subsequent PORT join/prune messages are received, they should be matched against the last seen Interface ID.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.11">Note that, a Join sent over a Transport connection will only be seen by the upstream router, and thus will not cause  routers on the link that do not use PIM PORT with the upstream router to possibly delay the refresh of Join state for the same state.  Similarly, a Prune sent over a Transport connection will only be seen by the upstream router, and will thus never cause routers on the link that do not use PIM PORT with the upstream router, to send a Join to override this Prune.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.12">Note also, that a datagram PIM Join/Prune message for a said (S,G) or (*,G) sent by some router on a link will not cause routers on the same link that use a Transport connection with the upstream router for that state, to suppress the refresh of that state to the upstream router (because they don't need to periodically refresh this state) or to send a Join to override a Prune (as the upstream router will only stop forwarding the traffic when all joined routers that use a Transport connection have explicitly sent a Prune for this state, as explained in <a href="#track">Section 6</a>).</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.1">TCP/SCTP packets used for PORT MUST be sent with a TTL/Hop Limit of 255 to facilitate enabling of the Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM) <a href="#RFC5082">[RFC5082]</a>. Implementations SHOULD provide a configuration option to enable the GTSM check at the receiver. This means checking that inbound packets from directly connected neighbors have a TTL/Hop Limit of 255, but MAY also allow for a different TTL/Hop Limit threshold to check that the sender is within a certain number of router hops. The GTSM check SHOULD be disabled by default.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">Implementations SHOULD support the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) <a href="#RFC5925">[RFC5925]</a> and SCTP Authenticated Chunks <a href="#RFC4895">[RFC4895]</a>.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.2">4.2.</a> Connection Maintenance</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.1">TCP is designed to keep connections up indefinitely during a period of network disconnection. If a PIM-over-TCP router fails, the TCP connection may stay up until the neighbor actually reboots, and even then it  may continue to stay up until you actually try to send the neighbor some information. This is particularly relevant to PIM, since the flow of Join/Prune messages might be in only one direction, and the downstream neighbor might never get any indication via TCP that the other end of the connection is not really there.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.2">SCTP has a heart beat mechanism that can be used to detect that a connection is working, even when no data is sent.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.3">One can detect that a PORT connection is not working by regularly sending PORT messages. This applies to both TCP and SCTP. E.g., for TCP the connection will be reset if no TCP ACKs are received after a few retries. PORT in itself does not require any periodic signaling.  PORT Join/Prune messages are only sent when there is a state change. If the state changes are not frequent enough, a PORT Keep-Alive message can be sent instead. E.g. if an implementation wants to send a PORT message, to check that the connection is working, at least every 60 seconds, then whenever there is 60 seconds since the previous message, a Keep-Alive message could be sent. If there were less than 60 seconds between each Join/Prune, no Keep-Alive messages would be needed.  Implementations SHOULD support the use of PORT Keep-Alive messages. It is RECOMMENDED that a configuration option is available to network administrators to enable it when needed.  Note that Keep-Alives can be used by a peer, independently of whether the other peer supports it.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.4">The mechanism above relies on the connection eventually going down when we don't get any ACKs for the data we send.  A quicker and more reliable way of detecting that a connection is not working, is to send regular PORT messages, and have our peer take down the connection if it doesn't receive them. This can be done by sending Keep-alive messages with a non-zero Holdtime value. If the last received Keep-alive message had a non-zero Holdtime, one tears down the connection if the time measured in seconds since the last processed PORT message exceeds the specified Holdtime.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.5">Implementations SHOULD support Keep-Alive messages. An implementation that supports Keep-Alive messages acts as follows when processing a received PORT message.  When processing a Keep-Alive message with a non-zero Holdtime value, it MUST set a timer to the value. We call this timer Connection Expiry Timer (CET). If the CET is already running, it MUST be reset to the new value. When processing a Keep-Alive message with a zero Holdtime value, the CET MUST be stopped if running.  When processing a PORT message other than Keep-Alive, the CET MUST be reset to the last received Holdtime value if running. If the CET is not running, no action is taken.  If the CET expires, the connection SHOULD be shut down.  This specification does not mandate a specific default Holdtime value. However, the dynamic congestion and flow control in TCP and SCTP can result in variable transit delay between the endpoints when capacity varies, there may be loss in the network or variable link performance. Consistent behaviour therefore requires a sufficiently large Holdtime value. E.g., 60 seconds to prevent premature termination.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.6">It is possible that a router receives Join/Prune messages for an interface/link that is down. As long as the neighbor has not expired, it is RECOMMENDED processing those messages as usual. If they are ignored, then the router SHOULD ensure it gets a full update for that interface when it comes back up. This can be done by changing the GenID (Generation Identifier, see <a href="#RFC4601">[RFC4601]</a>), or by terminating and reestablishing the connection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.7">If a PORT neighbor changes its GenID and a connection is established or attempting to be established, the local side should generally tear down the connection and do as described in <a href="#down">Section 4.3</a>. However, if the connection is shared by multiple interfaces and the GenID changes only for one of them, the local side SHOULD simply send a full update, similar to other cases when a GenID changes for an upstream neighbor.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.3">4.3.</a> <a href="#down" id="down">Actions When a Connection Goes Down</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.1">A connection may go down for a variety of reasons. It may be due to an error condition, or a configuration change.  A connection SHOULD be shut down as soon as there are no more PIM neighbors using it. That is, for the connection we have associated local and remote Connection IDs. When there is no PIM neighbor with that particular remote connection ID on any interface where we announce the local connection ID, the connection SHOULD be shut down. This may happen when a new connection ID is configured, PORT is disabled, or a PIM neighbor expires.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.2">If a PIM neighbor expires, one should free connection state and downstream oif-list state for the neighbor. A downstream router, when an upstream neighboring router has expired, will simply update the RPF neighbor for the corresponding state to a new neighbor where it would trigger Join/Prune messages. This behavior is according to <a href="#RFC4601">[RFC4601]</a> where also the term RPF neighbor is defined. It is required of a PIM router to clear its neighbor table for a neighbor who has timed out due to neighbor holdtime expiration.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.3">When a connection is no longer available between two PORT enabled PIM neighbors, they MUST immediately, or on-demand, try to reestablish the connection following the normal rules for connection establishment. The neighbors MUST also start expiry timers so that all oif-list state for the neighbor using the connection, gets expired after JP_HOLDTIME, unless it later gets refreshed by receiving new Join/Prunes.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.4">The value of JP_HOLDTIME is 215 seconds. This value is based on section 4.11 of <a href="#RFC4601">[RFC4601]</a> which says that JP_HoldTime should be 3.5 * t_periodic where the default for t_periodic is 60 seconds.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.4">4.4.</a> Moving from PORT to Datagram Mode</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.1">There may be situations where an administrator decides to stop using PORT. If PORT is disabled on a router interface, or a previously PORT enabled neighbor no longer announces any of the PORT Hello options, the router follows the rules in <a href="#down">Section 4.3</a> for taking down connections and starting timers. Next, the router SHOULD trigger a full state update similar to what would be done if the GenID changed in Datagram Mode.  The router SHOULD send Join/Prune messages for any state where the router switched from PORT to Datagram Mode for the upstream neighbor.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.5">4.5.</a> <a href="#ondemand" id="ondemand">On-demand versus Pre-configured Connections</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.1">Transport connections could be established when they are needed or when a router interface to other PIM neighbors has come up. The advantage of on-demand Transport connection establishment is the reduction of router resources. Especially in the case where there is no need for a full mesh of connections on a network interface.  The disadvantage is additional delay and queueing when a Join/Prune message needs to be sent and a Transport connection is not established yet.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.2">If a router interface has become operational and PIM neighbors are learned from Hello messages, at that time, Transport connections may be established. The advantage is that a connection is ready to transport data by the time a Join/Prune message needs to be sent. The disadvantage is there can be more connections established than needed. This can occur when there is a small set of RPF neighbors for the active distribution trees compared to the total number of neighbors. Even when Transport connections are pre-established before they are needed, a connection can go down and an implementation will have to deal with an on-demand situation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.3">Note that for TCP, it is the router with the lower Connection ID that decides whether to open a connection immediately, or on-demand. The router with the higher Connection ID SHOULD only initiate a connection on-demand. That is, if it needs to send a Join/Prune message and there is no currently established connection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.4">Therefore, this specification RECOMMENDS but does not mandate the use of on-demand Transport connection establishment.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.6">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.6">4.6.</a> Possible Hello Suppression Considerations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.1">Based on this specification, a Transport connection cannot be established until a Hello message is received. One reason for this is to determine if the PIM neighbor supports this specification and the other is to determine the remote address to use to establish the Transport connection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.2">There are cases where it is desirable to suppress entirely the transmission of Hello messages. In this case, it is outside the scope of this document on how to determine if the PIM neighbor supports this specification as well as an out-of-band (outside of the PIM protocol) method to determine the remote address to establish the Transport connection. </p>

<a href="#rfc.section.4.7">4.7.</a> Avoiding a Pair of TCP Connections between Neighbors</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.7.p.1">To ensure that there is only one TCP connection between a pair of  PIM neighbors, the following set of rules MUST be followed.  Note that this section applies only to TCP, for SCTP this is not an issue. Let A and B be two PIM neighbors where A's Connection ID is numerically smaller than B's Connection ID, and each is known to the other as having a potential PIM adjacency relationship.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">It may be desirable for scaling purposes to allow Join/Prune messages from different PIM protocol families to be sent over the same Transport connection. Also, it may be desirable to have a set of Join/Prune messages for one address-family sent over a Transport connection that is established over a different address-family network layer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">To be able to do this we need a common PORT message format.  This will provide both record boundary and demux points when sending over a stream protocol like TCP/SCTP.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.6">6.</a> <a href="#track" id="track">Explicit Tracking</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">When explicit tracking is used, a router keeps track of join state for individual downstream neighbors on a given interface.  This is done for all PORT joins and prunes. It may also be done for native join/prune messages, if all neighbors on the LAN have set the T bit of the LAN Prune Delay option. In the discussion below we will talk about ET (explicit tracking) neighbors, and non-ET neighbors. The set of ET neighbors MUST include the PORT neighbors. The set of non-ET neighbors consists of all the non-PORT neighbors unless all neighbors have set the LAN Prune Delay T bit. Then the ET neighbors set contains all neighbors.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">For some link-types, e.g. point-to-point, tracking neighbors is no different than tracking interfaces. It may also be possible for an implementation to treat different downstream neighbors as being on different logical interfaces, even if they are on the same physical link.  Exactly how this is implemented and for which link types, is left to the implementer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.3">For (*,G) and (S,G) state, the router starts forwarding traffic on an interface when a Join is received from a neighbor on such an interface. When a non-ET neighbor sends a Prune, as specified <a href="#RFC4601">[RFC4601]</a>, if no Join is sent to override this Prune before the expiration of the Override Timer, the upstream router concludes that no non-ET neighbor is interested.  If no ET neighbors are interested, the interface can be removed from the oif-list. When an ET neighbor sends a Prune, one removes the join state for that neighbor. If no other ET or non-ET neighbors are interested, the interface can be removed from the oif-list. When a PORT neighbor sends a prune, there can be no Prune Override, since the Prune is not visible to other neighbors.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.4">For (S,G,rpt) state, the router needs to track Prune state on the shared tree. It needs to know which ET neighbors have sent prunes, and whether any non-ET neighbors have sent prunes.  Normally one would forward a packet from a source S to a group G out on an interface if a (*,G)-join is received, but no (S,G,rpt)-prune. With ET one needs to do this check per ET neighbor. That is, the packet should be forwarded unless all ET neighbors that have sent (*,G)-joins have also sent (S,G,rpt)-prunes, and if a non-ET neighbor has sent a (*,G)-join, whether there also is non-ET (S,G,rpt)-prune state.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7">
<a href="#rfc.section.7">7.</a> Multiple Address-Family Support</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">To allow for efficient use of router resources, one can mux Join/Prune messages of different address families on the same Transport connection.  There are two ways this can be accomplished, one using a common message format over a TCP connection and the other using multiple streams over a single SCTP connection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">Using the common message format described previously in this specification, using different PORT options, both IPv4 and IPv6 based Join/Prune messages can be encoded within the same Transport connection.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">When using SCTP multi-streaming, the common message format is still used to convey address family information but an SCTP association is used, on a per-family basis, to send data concurrently for multiple families. When data is sent concurrently, head of line blocking, which can occur when using TCP, is avoided.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.9">9.</a> Security Considerations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.1">There are several security issues related to the use of TCP or SCTP transports. The attacks would consist of sending packets with a spoofed source address. Either establishing a connection, or injecting packets into an existing connnection.  This might allow someone to send spoofed join/prune messages, and may also allow someone to reset the connection. Mechanisms that help protect against this are discussed in <a href="#consec">Section 4.1</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.2">For authentication one may for TCP use TCP-AO <a href="#RFC5925">[RFC5925]</a>, and for SCTP use Authenticated Chunks <a href="#RFC4895">[RFC4895]</a>. Also GTSM <a href="#RFC5082">[RFC5082]</a> can be used to help prevent spoofing.  </p>
