                Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP)
          draft-boucadair-connectivity-provisioning-profile-03

Abstract

   This document describes the Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP)
   and proposes a CPP Template to capture IP connectivity requirements
   to be met within a service delivery context (e.g., Voice over IP or
   IP TV).  The CPP defines the set of IP transfer parameters to be
   supported by the underlying transport network together with a
   reachability scope and bandwidth/capacity needs.  Appropriate
   performance metrics such as one-way delay or one-way delay variation
   are used to characterize an IP transfer service.  Both global and
   restricted reachability scopes can be captured in the CPP.

   Such a generic CPP template is meant to (1) facilitate the automation
   of the service negotiation and activation procedures, thus
   accelerating service provisioning, (2) set (traffic) objectives of
   Traffic Engineering functions and service management functions and
   (3) improve service and network management systems with 'decision-
   making' capabilities based upon negotiated/offered CPPs.

Internet-Draft                     CPP                        March 2014


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP)
   and proposes a CPP Template to capture IP/MPLS connectivity
   requirements to be met within a service delivery context (e.g., Voice
   over IP, IP TV, VPN services).

   In this document, the IP connectivity service is the IP transfer
   capability characterized by a (Destination, Guarantees, Scope) tuple
   where "Destination" is a group of IP addresses, "Guarantees" reflect
   the guarantees (expressed in terms of QoS, performance and
   availability, for example) to properly forward traffic to the said
   "Destination".  Finally, the "Scope" denotes the (network) perimeter
   (e.g., between two PE (Provider Equipment) routers where the said
   guarantees need to be provided.

1.1.  Connectivity Provisioning Interface (CPI)

   Figure 1 shows the various connectivity provisioning interfaces
   covered by CPP: the Customer-Network Connectivity Provisioning
   Interface, the Service-Network Connectivity Provisioning Interface,
   and the Network-Network Connectivity Provisioning Interface.
   Services and applications whose parameters are captured by means of a
   CPP exchanged through the Service-Network Connectivity Provisioning
   Interface may be provided by the same administrative entity that
   operates the underlying network, or by another entity (for example, a
   Content Provider).

                  +---------+
                  |Service A|
                  +---+-----+
                      |    +---------+
                      |CPI |Service B|
                      |    +-+-------+
                      |      |CPI
   +----------+     +-+------+-------+     +------------+
   |Subscriber|-----|Network Provider|-----|Peer Network|
   +----------+ CPI +----------------+ CPI +------------+


              Figure 1: Connectivity Provisioning Interfaces

   The interfaces depicted in Figure 1, can be summarized as shown in
   Figure 2.

   The Customer shown in Figure 2 may be another Network Provider (e.g.,
   an IP transit provider), a Service Provider (e.g., an IP telephony
   Service Provider) which requires the invocation of resources provided

Internet-Draft                     CPP                        March 2014


   by a Network Provider, or an enterprise which wants to interconnect
   its various sites by subscribing to a VPN service provided by a
   Network Provider.  The proposed CPP can be used to expose, capture,
   and facilitate the negotiation of the service parameters between
   these various entities, thereby presenting a common template for
   describing the available connectivity services.

                            +----------------+
                            |   Customer     |
                            +-------+--------+
                                    + CPI
                            +-------+--------+
                            |Network Provider|
                            +----------------+


        Figure 2: CPP: Generic Connectivity Provisioning Interfaces

   In the rest of the document, "Customer" is used as a generic term to
   denote the business entity that subscribes to connectivity services
   offered by a Network Provider (Figure 2).

1.2.  Rationale

   Procedures for the design and the operation of IP services have
   become increasingly diverse and complex.  The time it takes to
   negotiate service parameters and then proceed with the corresponding
   resource allocation can thus be measured in days, if not weeks.  Yet,
   the bilateral discussions that usually take place between a customer
   and a Network Provider hardly rely upon some kind of standard
   checklist, where the customer would be invited to tick all the
   parameters that apply to its environment, and then negotiate these
   parameters with the Network Provider, as a function of the available
   resources, the customer's expectations, the provider's network
   planning policy, etc.

   The definition of a clear interface between the service (including
   third-party applications) and the network layers would therefore
   facilitate the said discussion, thereby improving the overall service
   delivery procedure by optimizing the design of the network
   infrastructures.  Indeed, the CPP interface aims at exposing and
   characterizing, in a technology-agnostic manner, the IP transfer
   requirements to be met when invoking IP transfer capabilities of a
   network operated by a Network Provider between a set of Customer
   Nodes (e.g., Media Gateway (section-11.2.7 [RFC2805]), Session Border
   Controller [RFC5853], etc.) .

Internet-Draft                     CPP                        March 2014


   These requirements include: reachability scope (e.g., limited scope,
   Internet-wide), direction, bandwidth requirements, QoS parameters
   (e.g., one-way delay [RFC2679], loss [RFC2680] or one-way delay
   variation [RFC3393]), protection and high availability guidelines
   (e.g., sub-50ms/sub-100ms/second restoration).

   These requirements are then translated into IP/MPLS-related technical
   clauses (e.g., need for recovery means, definition of the class of
   service, need for control plane protection, etc.).  In a later stage,
   these various clauses will be addressed by the activation of adequate
   network features and technology-specific actions (e.g., MPLS-TE
   (Multiprotocol Label Switching TE, [RFC3346]), RSVP (Resource
   Reservation Protocol, [RFC2205]), OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) or
   IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System), etc.), by means
   of CPP-derived configuration information.

   For traffic conformance purposes, a CPP also includes flow
   identification and classification rules to be followed by
   participating nodes whenever they have to process traffic according
   to a specific service as defined by the said CPP.

   The CPP template aims at capturing connectivity needs and to
   represent and value these requirements in a standardized manner.
   Service- and Customer-specific IP provisioning rules may lead to a
   dramatic increase of the number of IP transfer classes that need to
   be (pre)-engineered in the network.  Instantiating each CPP into a
   distinct class of service should therefore be avoided for the sakes
   of performance and scalability.

   Therefore, application-agnostic IP provisioning practices should be
   recommended since the requirements captured in the CPP can be used to
   identify which network class of service is to be used to meet those
   requirements/guarantees.  From that standpoint, the CPP concept is
   meant to design a limited number of generic classes, so that
   individual CPP documents, by capturing the connectivity requirements
   of services, applications and Customers, can be easily mapped to
   these classes.

   CPP may also be used as a guideline for network dimensioning and
   planning teams of a Network Provider to ensure that appropriate
   resources (e.g., network cards, routers, link capacity, etc.) have
   been provisioned.  Otherwise, (underlying) transport networks would
   not be able to meet the objectives expressed in all CPP requests.

   Such a generic CPP template:

   o  Facilitates the automation of the service negotiation and
      activation procedures, thus improving service delivery times;



Boucadair, et al.       Expires September 5, 2014               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                     CPP                        March 2014


   o  Can help setting Traffic Engineering function and service
      management function objectives, as a function of the number of CPP
      templates to be processed over a specific period of time, for
      example.
   o  Improves service and network management systems by adding
      'decision-making' capabilities based upon negotiated/offered CPPs.

   In addition, this CPP abstraction makes a clear distinction between
   the connectivity provisioning requirements and the associated
   technology-specific rules that need to be applied by participating
   nodes, and which are meant to accommodate such requirements.

   The CPP defines the set of IP/MPLS transfer guarantees to be offered
   by the underlying transport network together with a reachability
   scope and capacity needs.  Appropriate performance metrics such as
   one-way delay or one-way delay variation are used to characterize the
   IP transfer service.  Guarantees related to availability and
   resiliency are also included in the CPP.

   The CPP can be used in an integrated business environment (where the
   service and network infrastructures are managed by the same
   administrative entity) or another business environment (where an
   administrative entity manages the service while another manages the
   network infrastructure).  In the following sections, no assumption is
   made about the business environment (integrated or not).

   Service differentiation at the network layer can be enforced by
   tweaking various parameters which belong to distinct dimensions (e.g,
   forwarding, routing, processing of incoming traffic, traffic
   classification, etc.).  This document does not make any assumption on
   how network services are implemented within an networking
   infrastructure.

   An example of CPP usage is through the northbound interface
   introduced by the Application-based Network Operations (ABNO)
   framework [I-D.farrkingel-pce-abno-architecture].

1.3.  Reference Architecture

   Customer Nodes belong to a Customer (including corporate Customers)
   or a service infrastructure (see Figure 1).  In some contexts,
   Customer Nodes can be provided and managed by the Network Provider.
   The connectivity between these Customer Nodes reflects the IP
   transfer capability implemented thanks to the allocation of a set of
   IP resources.  IP transfer capabilities are considered by the above
   services as black boxes.  Appropriate notifications and reports would
   be communicated (through dedicated means) to Customer Nodes to assess
   the compliance of the experienced IP transfer service against what

   has been negotiated with the corresponding CPP.  These notifications
   may also be used to assess the efficiency of the various policies
   enforced in the networking infrastructure to accommodate the
   requirements detailed in the CPP.

   The CPP reference architectures are depicted in
   Figure 3Figure 4Figure 5.

   The Customer infrastructure can be connected over networking
   infrastructures managed by one or several Network Providers.

   be used to negotiate and enforce a given CPP are not discussed in
   this document.

   In addition to CPP clauses, other clauses may be included in an
   agreement between a Customer and a Provider (e.g., contact point,
   escalation procedure, incidents management, billing, etc.).  It is
   out of scope of this document to detail all those additional clauses.

   Examples of how to translate CPP clauses into specific policies are
   provided for illustration purposes.  It is out of scope of this
   document to provide an exhaustive list of the technical means to meet
   the objectives detailed in a CPP.

3.  Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP)

   A CPP can be seen as the inventory of connectivity provisioning
   requirements with regard to the IP transfer service.  CPP clauses are
   elaborated in the following sub-sections.  The CPP template is
   provided in Figure 6.

3.1.  Customer Nodes

   A CPP must include the list of Customer Nodes (e.g., CEs) to be
   connected to the underlying IP transport network.

   These nodes should be unambiguously identified (e.g., using a unique
   Service_identifier).  For each Customer Node, a border link or a node
   that belongs to the domain that connects the Customer Nodes should be
   identified.

   Based on the location of the Customer Node, appropriate operations to
   retrieve the corresponding border link or "Provider Node" (e.g., PE)
   should be undertaken.  This operation can be manual or automated.

   A "service site" would be located behind a given Customer Node.  A
   site identifier may be captured in the CPP for the provisioning of
   managed VPN services [RFC4026] for instance (e.g., Site_identifier).

   A Customer Node may be connected to several Provider Nodes and
   multiple Customer Nodes may be connected to the same Provider Node
   (see Figure 3).

3.2.  Scope

   The Scope specifies the reachability of each of involved Customer
   Nodes, from both an incoming and outgoing traffic perspectives,
   thereby yielding specific traffic directionality considerations.  It

Internet-Draft                     CPP                        March 2014


   is defined as an unidirectional parameter.  Both directions should be
   described in the CPP.

   The reachability scope may be defined as the set of destination
   prefixes that can be reached from a given customer site.  Both global
   and restricted reachability scopes can be captured in the CPP.  A
   restricted reachability scope means no global reachability is allowed
   and only a set of destinations can be reached from a customer site.

   Both IPv4 and IPv6 scopes may be distinguished.

   A "Scope" delimits a topological (or geographical) network portion
   beyond which the performance and availability guarantees do not
   apply.

   A scope may be defined by an "Ingress" point and an "Egress" point.
   Several types may be considered, such as:

      (1) "1:1" Pipe model.  Only point-to-point communications are
      allowed.
      (2) "1:N" Hose model.  Only communications from one site towards a
      set of destinations are allowed.
      (3) "1:any" Unspecified hose model.  All outbound communications
      are allowed.

   The Ingress and Egress points could be Customer Nodes/Provider Nodes
   or external nodes, provided that these nodes are unambiguously
   identified (e.g., IPv6 prefix), or a set of IP destinations.

3.3.  QoS Guarantees

   QoS guarantees denote a set of IP transfer performance metrics which
   characterize the quality of the IP transfer treatment to be
   experienced (when crossing an IP transport infrastructure) by a flow
   issued from or forwarded to a (set of) "Customer Node(s)".

   IP performance metrics can be expressed as qualitative or
   quantitative parameters (both quantitative and qualitative guarantees
   cannot be specified in the same CPP).  When quantitative metrics are
   used, maximum or average numerical values are provided together with
   a validity interval which should be indicated in the measurement
   method.

   Several performance metrics have been defined such as:

   o  Traffic Loss [RFC2680]
   o  One way delay [RFC2679]
   o  One way delay variation [RFC3393]

Internet-Draft                     CPP                        March 2014


   The value of these parameters may be specific to a given path or a
   given scope (e.g., between two Customer Nodes).  Concretely, IP
   performance metric values indicated in a CPP should reflect the
   measurement between a set of Customer Nodes or between a Customer
   Node and a set of Provider Nodes.

   Quantitative guarantees can only be specified for in-profile traffic
   (i.e., up to a certain traffic rate).  A CPP can include throughput
   guarantees; when specified, these guarantees are equivalent to
   quantitative or qualitative loss guarantees.

   the Meta-QoS class concept can be used when qualitative metrics are
   used [RFC5160].

3.4.  Availability Guarantees

   This clause specifies the percentage of the time during which the
   agreed IP performance guarantees apply.  The clause can be expressed
   as maximum/average.  The exact meaning of the clause value is defined
   during the CPP negotiation process.

   The guarantees cover both QoS deterioration (i.e., IP transfer
   service is available but it is below the agreed performance bounds),
   physical failures or service unavailability in general.  In order to
   meet the availability guarantees, several engineering practices may
   be enforced at the border between the customer and the Network
   Provider, such as multi-homing designs.

   The following mechanisms are provided as examples that show that
   different technical options may be chosen to meet the service
   availability objectives:

   o  When an IGP instance is running between the "Customer Node" and
      the "Provider Node", activate a dedicated protocol, such as BFD
      (Bi-directional Forwarding Detection [RFC5881][RFC5883]), to
      control IGP availability and to ensure sub-second IGP adjacency
      failure detection.
   o  Use of LSP Ping capability to detect LSP availability (check
      whether the LSP is in place or not) [RFC4379].
   o  Pre-install backup LSPs for fast-reroute purposes, when a MPLS
      network connects Customer Nodes [RFC4090].
   o  Enable VRRP [RFC5798].
   o  Enable IP Fast Reroute features (e.g., [RFC5286]).

Internet-Draft                     CPP                        March 2014


3.5.  Capacity

   This clause characterizes the required capacity to be provided by the
   underlying IP transport network.  This capacity is bound to a defined
   "Scope" (See Section 3.2) and IP transfer performance guarantees (see
   (Section 3.3)and (Section 3.4)).

   The capacity may be expressed for both traffic directions (i.e.,
   incoming and outgoing) and for every border link.  The capacity
   clause defines the limits of the application of quantitative
   guarantees.

   It is up to the administrative entity, which manages the IP transport
   network, to appropriately dimension its network [RFC5136] to meet the
   capacity requirements expressed in all negotiated CPPs.

3.6.  Conformance Traffic

   When capacity information (see Section 3.5) is included in the CPP,
   requirements for Out-of-Profile traffic treatment need to be also
   expressed in the CPP.

   Shaping/policing filters may be applied so as to assess whether
   traffic is within the capacity profile or out of profile.  Out-of-
   Profile traffic may be discarded or assigned another class (e.g.,
   using the Lower than Best Effort PDB [RFC3662]).

   Packet MTU conditions may also be indicated in the CPP.

3.7.  Overall Traffic Guarantees

   Overall traffic guarantees are defined when Traffic Volume
   (Section 3.5)/Conformance (Section 3.6) clauses are not specified.
   Or if they are actually specified, then Out-of-Profile traffic is
   assigned another class of service, but is not discarded.  Such
   guarantees can only be qualitative delay and/or qualitative loss or
   throughput guarantees.

   If overall traffic guarantees are not specified, best effort
   forwarding is implied.

3.8.  Traffic Isolation

   This clause indicates if the traffic issued by/destined to "Customer
   Nodes" should be isolated when crossing the IP transport network.

   This clause can then be translated into VPN policy provisioning
   information, such as the information pertaining to the activation of

Internet-Draft                     CPP                        March 2014


   dedicated tunnels using IPsec, BGP/MPLS VPN facilities [RFC4364], or
   a combination thereof.  The activation of such features should be
   consistent with the availability and performance guarantees that have
   been negotiated.

3.9.  Flow Identification

   To identify the flows that need to be handled within the context of a
   given CPP, flow identifiers should be indicated in the CPP.  This
   identifier is used for traffic classification purposes.

   A flow identifier may be composed of the following parameters:

   o  Source IP address,
   o  Source port number,
   o  Destination IP address,
   o  Destination port number,
   o  ToS or DSCP field,
   o  Tail-end tunnel endpoint, or
   o  Any combination thereof.

   Distinct treatments may be implemented for elastic and non elastic
   traffic (e.g., see the "Constraints on traffic" clause defined in
   [RFC5160]).

   Flow classification rules may be specific to a given link or a given
   rule may be applied for all border links.  This should be clearly
   captured in the CPP.  For incoming traffic, some practices such as
   DSCP re-marking should be indicated in CPP.  Re-marking action is
   under the responsibility of IP nodes, but this should be conditioned
   by some constraints such as maintaining the service-specific marking
   integrity (e.g., VPN service).

3.10.  Routing & Forwarding

   When outsourced routing actions are required, dedicated routes may be
   installed so as to convey the traffic to its (service) destination.
   These routes may be computed, selected and installed for traffic
   engineering purposes (e.g., to forward the traffic to some
   destination while avoiding some nodes (or ASes)).

   A requirement for setting up a logical routing topology may also be
   considered [RFC4915] or [RFC5120], e.g., to facilitate the management
   of the nodes that are involved in the forwarding of the traffic as
   defined in the CPP.

   This practice should be indicated in the CPP, otherwise path
   computation is left to the underlying IP routing capabilities.  The

Internet-Draft                     CPP                        March 2014


   forwarding behavior (e.g., Per Domain Behavior) may also be specified
   in a CPP, but remains optional.  If indicated, consistency with the
   IP performance bounds defined in the CPP should be carefully ensured.

   In the context of VoIP (Voice over IP) deployments for instance, a
   routing policy would be to avoid satellite links since this may
   degrade the offered service.

3.11.  Activation Means

   This clause indicates the required action(s) to be undertaken to
   activate access to the IP connectivity service.

   Examples of these actions would be the activation of an IGP instance,
   the establishment of a BGP [RFC4271] or MP-BGP session [RFC4760],
   etc.

3.12.  Invocation Means

   Two types are defined:

   Implicit:  This clause indicates that no explicit means to invoke the
      connectivity service is required.  Access to the connectivity
      service is primarily conditioned by the requested network
      capacity.
   Explicit:  This clause indicates the need for explicit means to
      access the connectivity service.  Examples of such means include
      the use of RSVP [RFC2205] or RSVP-TE [RFC3209].  Appropriate
      access control procedures [RFC6601] would have to be enforced to
      check whether the capacity actually used is not above the agreed
      threshold.

3.13.  Notifications

   For operation purposes (e.g., supervision) and service fulfillment
   needs, management platforms need to be notified about critical events
   which may impact the delivery of the service.

   The notification procedure should be indicated in the CPP.  This
   procedure may specify the type of information to be sent, the
   interval, the data model, etc.

   Notifications can be sent to the management platform by using SNMP,
   Syslog notifications, CPNP signals, or a phone call!

4.  CPP Template

   Figure 6 provides the RBNF (Routing Backus-Naur Form, [RFC5511])
   format of the CPP template.  A CPP document includes several
   connectivity provisioning components; each of these is structured as
   a CPP.

                          Figure 6: CPP Template

   The description of these clauses is provided in Section 3.

   The CPP may include Customer's administrative information, such as a
   name and other contact details.  An example of the RBNF format of the
   Customer's information is shown in Figure 7.

   <Customer Description> ::= <NAME> <Contact Information>
   <Contact Information> ::=  <EMAIL_ADDRESS> [<POSTAL_ADDRESS>]
                              [<TELEPHONE_NUMBER> ...]

                   Figure 7: Customer Description Clause

   The CPP may include administrative information of the Network
   Provider too (name, AS number(s), and other contact details).  An
   example of the RBNF format of the provider's information is shown in
   Figure 8.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action from IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not define an architecture nor specify a protocol.
   Yet, means to guarantee the identity and the ability of a Customer to
   expose its connectivity requirements to a Network Provider through a
   CPP and, likewise, means to guarantee the identity and the ability of
   a Network Provider to expose its capabilities and to capture the
   requirements of a Customer through a CPP should be properly
   investigated.

   CPP documents should be protected againts illegitame modifications
   (e.g., modification, withdrawal); authorization means should be
   enabled.  These means are deployment-specific.

   with E. Mykoniati and D. Griffin.  Special thanks to them.
