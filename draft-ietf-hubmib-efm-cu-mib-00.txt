Internet-Draft            EFMCu Interfaces MIB              January 2004


1. Introduction

   New Ethernet like interfaces have been defined in the Institute of
   Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.3ah project a.k.a.
   Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM) [802.3ah]. In particular 2Base-TL
   and 10Pass-TS physical interfaces (PHYs), defined over voice-grade
   copper pairs, have been specified for the long and short reach
   respectively. These interfaces, collectively called EFMCu, support
   variable rates and optional Physical Medium Instance (PMI)
   aggregation (multi-pair bonding).

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community
   to manage EFMCu interfaces.

   Note that managed objects for Operation, Administration and
   Management (OAM) and Ethernet over Passive Optical Networks (EPON)
   clauses of IEEE 802.3ah are defined in EFM-COMMON-MIB
   [I-D.ietf-hubmib-efm-mib] and EFM-EPON-MIB
   [I-D.ietf-hubmib-efm-epon-mib] respectively.

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580]. A detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3. Relation to Interfaces Group MIB

   This section specifies how the ifStackTable, as defined in the IF-MIB
   [RFC2863] and ifInvStackTable, as defined in the
   IF-INVERTED-STACK-MIB [RFC2864] are used for the EFMCu application.

Internet-Draft            EFMCu Interfaces MIB              January 2004


3.1 Layering Model

   An EFMCu interface can aggregate up to 32 Physical Medium Instance
   (PMI) sublayer devices (modems), using so called PMI Aggregation
   Function (PAF).

   *EdNote: Change all occurrences of PMI to PME after 802.3ah/D3.1 is
   out as per resolution of comment 160.*

   An generic EFMCu device can have a number of Physical Coding Sublayer
   (PCS) ports, connected to a MAC via Medium Independent Interface
   (MII) at the upper layer, and cross-connected to a number of
   underlying PMIs, with a single PCS per PMI relationship, see clause
   61.1 of [802.3ah] for more details.

   Each PMI comprising an aggregated EFMCu port is represented in the
   Interface table as a separate port with ifType of shdsl(169) for
   2Base-TL or vdsl(97) for 10Pass-TS. The ifType values are defined in
   IANAifType-MIB. ifSpeed for each PMI shall return an actual bitrate
   of the active PMI or a configured bitrate for pre-activated modems
   (note that unassigned PMI has its default bitrate).

   The ifStackTable is indexed by the ifIndex values of the aggregated
   EFMCu port (PCS) and the PMIs connected to it. ifStackTable allows a
   Network Management application to determine which PMIs are connected
   to a particular PCS and change connections (if supported by the
   application). The ifInvStackTable, being an inverted version of the
   ifStackTable, provides an efficient means for a Network Management
   application to read a subset of the ifStackTable and thereby
   determine which PCS runs on top of a particular PMI.

   A new table efmCuAvailableStackTable defined in this MIB, specifies
   for each PCS a list of PMIs, which can possibly be cross-connected to
   that PCS, determined by the cross-connect capability of the device.
   This table, modeled after ifStackTable, is read only.

   *EdNote: An alternative would be to use ifStackTable to describe
   cross-connect capability and efmCuAvailableStackTable to describe
   actual connections, so that the cross-connect action would be done in
   the EFM-CU-MIB by modifying the efmCuAvailableStackTable (and not in
   IF-MIB).*

3.2 PMI Aggregation Function (PAF)

   The PMI Aggregation Function (PAF) is optional and may not be
   supported. Note however that it is mandatory for the agent to report
   on the PAF capability for all EFMCu ports (2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS).

   *EdNote: Add more info.*

3.3 Discovery Operation

   This MIB allows a Network Management application to control EFM
   Discovery mechanism and query its results. Note that the Discovery
   mechanism can work only if PAF is supported and enabled.

   Two tables are used by Discovery mechanism: ifStackTable and
   efmCuAvailableStackTable defined. The following pseudo-code defines
   an example of Discovery for a generic PAF enabled multi-PCS EFMCu
   device, located at Central Office (CO):

   foreach PCS[i] in Device
   { if ( PCS[i].PAFSupported ) // Discover only on ports supporting  PAF
       { dc = PCS[i].DiscoveryCode = MAC[i]; // unique 6 byte code per PCS
         // go over all currently disconnected PMIs, which can
         // pottentially be connected to PCS[i]
         foreach PMI[j] in efmCuAvailableStackTable[PCS[i]] and
                        not in ifStackTable[PCS[i]]
           { PMI[j].RemoteDiscoveryCode = dc;	// Set if Clear
             r = PMI[j].RemoteDiscoveryCode;	// Get
             if ( r == dc )
               { // Remote CPE connected via PMI[j] is/was a peer for
                 // PCS[i]. Connect this PMI to the PCS
                 Add PMI[j] to ifStackTable[PCS[i]];
                 // Discover all other currently disconnected PMIs,
                 // attached to the same CPE and connect them to the PCS
                 foreach PMI[k] in efmCuAvailableStackTable[PCS[i]] and
                                not in ifStackTable[PCS[i]]
                   { r = PMI[k].RemoteDiscoveryCode;	// Get
                     if ( r == dc )
                       Add PMI[k] to ifStackTable[PCS[i]];
                   }
               }
             // Discovered all PMIs which lead to the same CPE and
             // connected them to PCS[i]. Go to the next PCS.
             break;
           }
       }
   }

   The SNMP Agent builds efmCuStackTable according to the information
   contained in the Clause 45 PMI_Available_register (see [802.3ah]
   61.1.5.3 and 45.2.3.20).

   Adding a PMI to the ifStackTable row for a specific PCS, involves
   actual connection of the PMI to the PCS, which can be done by

   modifying Clause 45 PMI_Aggregate_register (see [802.3ah] 61.1.5.3
   and 45.2.3.21).

3.4 Relation to SHDSL MIB

   SHDSL modems, similar to PMI(s) comprising a 2BaseTL port are
   described in HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB [RFC3276]. While
   HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB describes standard G.SHDSL modems according to
   ITU-T G.991.2, IEEE 802.3ah uses soon to be approved G.SHDSL.bis
   spec, extended to support higher constellations and rates. In
   addition not all attributes of G.SHDSL modems reflected in
   HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB have adequate management objects in the EFM
   standards.

   Because of these differences and for the purposes of simplicity and
   name consistency it was decided not to reference HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB
   objects, but define all the relevant objects in this MIB.

3.5 Relation to VDSL MIB

   PMI(s) comprising a 10PassTS port are described in VDSL-LINE-MIB
   [I-D.ietf-adslmib-vdsl]. In cases where VDSL-LINE-MIB and 802.3ah
   differ, the definitions in 802.3ah take precedence.

   Because of these differences and for the purposes of simplicity and
   name consistency it was decided not to reference VDSL-LINE-MIB
   objects, but define all the relevant objects in this MIB.

3.6 Relation to Ethernet-Like and MAU MIBs

   The implementation of EtherLike-MIB [RFC3635] and MAU-MIB [RFC3636]
   is REQUIRED for the EFMCu interfaces. As such EFMCu interfaces
   2Base-TL/10Pass-TS SHALL return an ifType of ethernetCsmacd(6).
   Information on the particular flavor of EFMCu that an interface is
   running is available from ifSpeed in the IF-MIB [RFC2863], and
   ifMauType in the MAU-MIB.

   The MAU-MIB shall be augmented to include the following new values
   for ifMauType (instances of dot2MauType):

   o  dot3MauType2BaseTL - voice grade UTP Phy specified in Clause 61
      and 63

   o  dot3MauType10PassTS - voice grade UTP Phy specified in Clause 61
      and 62

   o  *EdNote: Should we also include -O/-R subtypes?*

3.7 Mapping of IEEE 802.3ah Managed Objects

   This section contains the mapping between managed objects defined in
   [802.3ah] Clause 30, and managed objects defined in this document and
   in associated MIB modules, i.e., the IF-MIB [RFC2863] and the MAU-MIB
   [RFC3636].

             This object is writable for the CO subtype PMIs (10PassTS-O).
             It is read-only for the CPE subtype (10PassTS-R).

             The SET operation sets a target for the PHY's Downstream Payload
             Bitrate as seen at the MII. If the payload rate of the selected
             profile cannot be achieved based on the loop environment,
             bandplan and PSD mask, the PHY shall drop the link.

             Changing Downstream Payload Rate Profile must be performed
             when the link is Down. Attempts to change this object MUST be
             rejected with the error inconsistentValue, if the link is Up or

          DESCRIPTION
             "This table, modeled after ifStackTable from [IF-MIB],
             contains information on the possible 'on-top-of'
             relationships between the multiple sub-layers of network
             interfaces (as opposed to actual relationships in
             ifStackTable).  In particular, it contains information on
             which PCS ports (sub-layers) can possible run 'on top of'
             which PMIs (sublayers), as determined by cross-connect
             capability of the EFMCu device, where each sub-layer
             corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.  For example,
             when the PCS port with ifIndex value x can be connected
             to run on top of the PMI with ifIndex value y, then this table
             contains:

               efmCuAvailableStackStatus.x.y=active

             For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies a PCS or PMI
             interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows
             in this table associated with I.  For one of these rows, I
             is the value of efmCuAvailableStackHigherLayer; for the other,
             I is the value of efmCuAvailableStackLowerLayer.
             Note that there's always at least on PCS for each PMI and at
             least one PMI for each PCS in the EFMCu devices.
             This table is ready only as it describes device capability"

5. Security Considerations

   There is a number of managed objects defined in this MIB module that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create. Most objects
   are writeable only when the link is Down. Writing to these objects
   can have potentially disruptive effects on network operation, for
   example:

   o  Changing of efmCuPortSide may lead to a potential locking of the
      link, as same PHYs of the same sub-type may not be able to
      exchange handshake messages.

   o  Changing of efmCuPAFAdminState to enabled may lead to a potential
      locking of the link, if the peer Phy does not support PAF.

   o  Changing of efmCuPAFDiscoveryCode before the discovery operation
      may lead to a wrongful discovery with possile multiple -O ports
      connecting to the same -R (both -O ports have the same Discovery
      register value) and similar cases.

   o  Changing any of the efmCuPmd2* or efmCuPmd10P* configuration may
      lead to anything from link quality and rate degradation to a
      complete disabling of the link.

   o  Finally activation of a PMI can cause a severe degradation of
      service for another EFMCu Phy whose PMI(s) may be affected by the
      cross-talk from the newly activated PMI.

   The user of this MIB module must therefore be aware that support for
   SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection
   can have a negative effect on network operations.

   The readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with MAX-ACCESS
   other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in some
   environments since, collectively, they provide information about the

   performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of
   their configuration.  In particular since EFMCu can be carried over
   Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) voice grade copper in a bundle with
   other pairs belonging to another operator/customer, it is
   theoretically possible to evasdrop to an EFMCu transmission simply by
   "listening" to a cross-talk from an EFMCu pair, especially if the
   parameters of the EFMCu link in question are known. In such
   environments it is important to control even GET and NOTIFY access to
   these objects and possibly even to encrypt their values when sending
   them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
   if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even
   then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed
   to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
