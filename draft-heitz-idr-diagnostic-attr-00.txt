                   draft-heitz-idr-diagnostic-attr-00

Abstract

   A BGP path attribute for the purpose of network diagnostics is
   described.  It is non-transitive, such that BGP speakers will not
   forward it by default.  It is structured as a list of elements.  An
   element begins with the BGP identifier and AS number of the speaker
   that adds the element and includes a list of TLVs.  Any speaker can
   add or remove an element to/from the list.  TLVs for a timestamp and
   for a checksum are described.

1.  Introduction

   A BGP path attribute for the purpose of network diagnostics is
   described.  It is non-transitive, such that BGP speakers will not
   propagate it by default.  It is structured as a list of elements.  An
   element begins with the BGP identifier and AS number of the speaker
   that adds the element and includes a list of TLVs.  Any speaker can
   add or remove an element to/from the list.  TLVs for a timestamp and
   for a checksum are described.  The diagnostic attribute may be sent
   in a withdraw message.

2.  Data Formats

   The BGP diagnostic consists of a series of elements, each of which is
   formatted as follows.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The fields are as follows:

      ASN             - 4 octet Autonomous System Number of the speaker
                        that added this element.

      BGP Identfifier - BGP Identifier of the speaker that added this
                        element.

      Length          - The number of octets comprising this element, If
                        there were no TLVs included, this length would
                        be 10.

      TLVs            - Any number of TLVs as further described.  Each
                        TLV is optional.

2.1.  Timestamp TLV

   The time at which the indicated speaker created this attribute during
   the process of creating to message to be sent.  The precision of the
   timestamp depends upon the diagnostic application that requires it
   and is out of scope of this document.

      Type       - 1.

      Length     - 12.

      Seconds    - The number of Seconds since 0 h 1 January 1900 UTC as
                   further described in Section 6 of [RFC5905].

      Fraction   - A fraction of the above seconds also described in
                   Section 6 of [RFC5905].

2.2.  Checksum TLV

   A checksum of the BGP message, including the marker field.  The
   checksum is only valid between the sending and receiving speaker.
   Since a receiving speaker may propagate an update, it will likely
   change the set of attributes or their order in its own update
   message, thus making the checksum useless in the propagated update.
   A BGP speaker MAY remove the checksum TLV from a propagated
   Diagnostic Path Attribute.

   |          Type = 2             |        Length = 6             |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |           Checksum            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The fields are as follows:

      Type       - 2.

      Length     - 6.

      Checksum   - The 16 bit checksum computed according to [RFC1071].

3.  Operational Considerations

   As with any new BGP attribute, if it is propagated, NLRI packing into
   BGP UPDATE messages may be affected.  This needs to be taken into
   consideration when using the Timestamp TLV to measure bulk update
   message timing.

   The Checksum TLV is useful to narrow down a source of corruption of
   UPDATE messages in each of the software and hardware layers between
   the actual BGP processes.

   The Diagnostic Path Attribute MAY be sent in an UPDATE message that
   does not contain an NLRI field [RFC4271] or an MP_REACH_NLRI Path
   Attribute [RFC4760].  When carried in such a message, it is unlikely
   to be propagated, although it is possible.

4.  Error Handling

   A checksum error shall not be treated as a protocol error.  The
   response is implementation dependent.

   A TLV length error shall be treated as attribute-discard according to
   [RFC7606].

   An unrecognized TLV MUST not be treated as a protocol error.

5.  Security Considerations

   This attribute is not forwarded by default.  Therefore, it should
   cause no unexpected ill effects.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a BGP path attribute value for the BGP
   Diagnostic Path Aattribute.

   IANA is requested to create and maintain a registry for the TLV
   types.  The allocation policies as per [RFC8126] are stated for the
   range of values.
