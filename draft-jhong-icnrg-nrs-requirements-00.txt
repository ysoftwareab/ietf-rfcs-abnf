              Requirements for Name Resolution Service in ICN
                 draft-jhong-icnrg-nrs-requirements-00.txt


Abstract

   This document discusses the motivation and requirements for Name
   Resolution Service (NRS) in ICN. The NRS in ICN is to translate
   object names into routing hints such as locators, where names are
   location-independent and locators are network addresses.

Internet-Draft            NRS Requirements                  March 2017


1. Introduction

   The current Internet is a host-centric networking, where hosts are
   uniquely identified with IP addresses and communication is possible
   between any pair of hosts. Thus, information in the current Internet
   is identified by the name of host where the information is stored.
   In contrast to the host-centric networking, the primary
   communication objects in Information-centric networking (ICN) are
   the named data objects (NDOs) and they are uniquely identified by
   the location-independent names. Thus, ICN aiming to the efficient
   dissemination and retrieval of the NDOs in a global scale has been
   identified and acknowledged as the most promising technology for the
   future Internet architecture to overcome the limitations of the
   current Internet such as scalability, mobility, etc.[28][29]

   ICN also has been emerged as a candidate architecture for IoT
   environment since IoT focuses on data and information rather than
   end-to-end communications [30][31][32]. In addition, the following
   ICN features are fulfilling well the architectural requirements of
   IoT such as naming, name resolution, scalability, resource
   constraints, mobility, caching, security, privacy, etc.[33][34]:

   - Naming of data, devices, and services independently from their
      locations

   - Distributed caching and processing

   - Decoupling between sender and receiver

   - Mobility support

   - Authentication and verification of content

   Since naming data independently from the current location where it
   is stored is a primary concept of ICN, how to discover the NDO using
   the location-independent name is one of the most important design
   challenges in ICN. Thus, most ICN architectures, such as DONA[4],
   PURSUIT[5], NDN[7][10], CCN[8], SAIL[6], MobilityFirst[9] are
   centered around routing for content retrieval.

   ICN routing generally involves three steps:

   - Name resolution[11][12][14][15][17][18]: matches/translates a
      content name to locators of providers/sources that can provide the
      content.

Internet-Draft            NRS Requirements                  March 2017


   - Content request routing: routes the content request towards the
      producer either based on the name or the locator. The process of
      name resolution and content request routing can be integrated. If
      integrated, the content request is routed by name, such as in
      NDN/CCN. If not integrated, the content request is routed by the
      locator obtained from the previous name resolution step, such as
      in DONA, PURSUIT, SAIL, MobilityFirst.

   - Content delivery: Constructs a path for transferring the content
      from the provider to the requester.  In the integrated approach,
      content can be routed using breadcrumbs left by the request to
      define a reverse path, or by some other mechanism, such as
      including a locator for the requester in the content request. In
      the uncombined approach, the content can be routed from the
      provider back to the request through an independent path.

   Thus the name resolution process in ICN architectures either can be
   separated from the message routing (e.g. routing of content request
   message) as a standalone process or can be integrated with the
   message routing as one combined process. The former is referred as
   standalone name resolution approach, the latter is referred as name
   based routing approach in this document.

   The following compares the standalone name resolution and name based
   routing approaches from different aspects:

   - Update message overhead: The update message overhead is due to the
      change of content reachability, which may include content caching
      or expiration, content producer mobility etc. The name based
      routing approach may require to flood part of the network for
      update propagation. In the worst case, the name based routing
      approach may flood the whole network (but mitigating techniques
      may be used to scope the flooding). The standalone name resolution
      approach only requires to update propagation in part of the name
      resolution overlay.

   - Resolution capability: The standalone name resolution approach can
      guarantee the resolution of any content in the network if it is
      registered to the name resolution overlay (assuming the content is
      being broadcast in the overlay after it is registered). On the
      other hand, the name based routing approach can only promise a
      high probability of content resolution, depending on the flooding
      scope of the content availability information (i.e. content
      publishing message and name based routing table).

   - Node failure impact: Nodes involved in the standalone name
      resolution approach are the name resolution overlay servers (e.g.


Hong, et al.         Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            NRS Requirements                  March 2017


      Resolution Handlers in DONA), while the nodes involved in the name
      based routing approach are routers which route messages based on
      locally maintained name based routing tables (e.g. NDN routers).
      Node failures in the standalone name resolution approach may cause
      some content resolution to fail even though the content is
      available. This problem does not exist in the name based routing
      approach because other alternative paths can be discovered to
      bypass the failed ICN routers, given the assumption that the
      network is still connected.

   - Maintained databases: The storage usage for the standalone name
      resolution approach is different from that of the name based
      routing approach. The standalone name resolution approach
      typically needs to maintain two databases: name to locator mapping
      in the name resolution overlay and routing tables in the routers
      on the data forwarding plane. The name based routing approach
      needs to maintain different databases: name routing table and
      optionally breadcrumbs for reverse routing of content back to the
      requester.

   Despite the coexistence of different name resolution approaches, the
   Name Resolution Service (NRS) is most essential service that shall
   be provided by the ICN infrastructure. Thus, in this document, we
   give the definition of NRS in ICN and discuss the motivation and the
   requirements in designing the NRS for ICN.

3. Motivation

   In this section, we give the definition of NRS in ICN and discuss
   the motivation why NRS is needed in ICN.



3.1. Name Resolution Service in ICN

   The Name Resolution Service (NRS) is defined as the service that is
   provided by ICN infrastructure to help a client to reach a specific
   piece of content, service, or host using a persistent name.

   The NRS could take the standalone name resolution approach to return
   the client with the locators of the content, which will be used by
   the underlying network as the identifier to route the client's
   request to one of the producers. There are several ICN projects that
   use the standalone name resolution approach such as DONA[4],
   PURSUIT[5], SAIL[6], MobilityFirst[9], IDNet[35], etc.

   The NRS could take the name based routing approach, which integrates
   the name resolution with the content request message routing as in
   NDN[7]/CCN[8].

   In the case that the content request also specifies the reverse
   path, as in NDN/CCN, the name resolution mechanism also determines
   the routing path for the data. This adds a requirement on the name
   resolution service to propagate interest in a way that is consistent
   with the subsequent data forwarding. Namely, the interest must
   select a path for the data based upon the finding the copy of the
   content, but also properly delivering the data.

   The NRS could also take hybrid approach which can perform name based
   routing approach from the beginning, when it fails at certain
   router, the router can go back to the standalone name resolution
   approach. The alternative hybrid NRS approach also works, which can
   perform standalone name resolution approach to find locators of
   routers which can carry out the name based routing of the client's
   request.

   A hybrid approach would combine name resolution as a subset of
   routers on the path with some tunneling in between (say, across an
   administrative domain) so that only a few of the nodes in the
   architecture perform name resolution in the name-based routing
   approach.

Internet-Draft            NRS Requirements                  March 2017


   Additionally, some other intermediary step may be included in the
   name resolution, namely the mapping of one name to other names, in
   order to facilitate the retrieval of named content, by way of a
   manifest[24][25]. The manifest is resolved using one of the two
   above approaches, and it may include further mapping of names to
   content and location. The steps for name resolution then become:
   first translate the manifest name into a location of a copy of the
   manifest; the manifest includes further names of the content
   components, and potentially locations for the content. The content
   is then retrieved by using these names and/or location, potentially
   resulting in additional name resolutions.

   No matter which approach is taken by the NRS in ICN, it is the most
   essential component or service of the ICN infrastructure.



3.2. Handling Heterogeneous Names in ICN

   In ICN design, a name is used to identify an entity, such as named
   data content, a device, an application, a service. ICN requires
   uniqueness and persistency of the name of any entity to ensure the
   reachability of the entity within certain scope and with proper
   authentication and trust guarantees. The name does not change with
   the mobility and multi-home of the corresponding entity. A client
   can always use this name to retrieve the content from network and
   verify the binding of the content and the name.

   Ideally, a name can include any form of identifier, which can be
   flat, hierarchical, and human readable or non-readable.



3.3. Handling Dynamism in ICN

                                                                      I
   ICN has the dynamic features like mobility, multi-homing, migration,
   and replication of named resources such as content, devices,
   services, etc. The dynamism of the names resources will be more in
   future networking contexts such as 5G or when services are
   virtualized over wider geography due to the namespace expansion into
   the routing/forwarding.

4. Requirements for NRS in ICN

   In this section, we provide the requirements for designing NRS in
   ICN in terms of operability, security and manageability,
   respectively.



4.1. Requirements on Operability

   The requirements on operability aspect are things that should be
   considered when the key operations of NRS are designed.

4.1.1. Scalability

   The NRS system must to be extremely scalable to support a large
   number of content objects as well as billions of users, who may
   access the system through various connection methods and devices.
   Especially in IoT applications, the data size is small but
   frequently generated by sensors. Message forwarding and processing,
   routing table building-up and name records propagation must be
   efficient and scalable. The memory requirement for NRS nodes should
   be achievable by the current memory technologies.

4.1.2. Delay sensitivity

   The name resolution process provided by the NRS must not introduce
   significant latencies. With more number of name record replications,
   the number of nodes involved in the name resolution may be reduced.
   For example, in the standalone name resolution approach, with the
   name record being replicated to higher hierarchy or the peer NRS
   server in the overlay, the name resolution can be responded more
   promptly. In the name based routing approach, with the content based
   routing table being broadcast within the larger scope in the
   network, the name resolution and request routing can have higher
   probability to successfully reach the nearer copy of the requested
   content.

   The NRS deployment should balance the number of nodes involved in
   the name resolution and the overhead/cost for the name record
   replication. To ensure the low latency, the NRS should be able to
   route a content request to the closest copy. Message forwarding and
   processing should be efficient and computation complexity should be
   reasonable low and affordable by the current processor technologies.

Internet-Draft            NRS Requirements                  March 2017


4.1.3. Time transiency

   The NRS should support time-transient content, which is frequently
   created in and disappearing from the network. This kind of content
   only stays in the network for a short time, which requires the NRS
   to be able to promptly reflect the records of them in the system.
   For example, some video clip only exists in the network for a very
   short time, which requires the NRS to promptly update their name
   records.

4.1.4. Minimum inter-domain traffic

   The NRS must attempt to minimize total traffic, and inter-domain
   traffic in particular. In order to achieve that, message propagation
   for name resolution and retrieval should retain the locality and
   should be kept in the network domain if that domain contains both
   the client and the content copy.

   For example, a client is requesting the temperature data of the
   building that he/she is residing in, the NRS should be able to
   return or route to the nearest gateway in the building that stores
   such data instead of a remote server in the cloud.

4.1.5. Fault tolerance

   The NRS must ensure resilience to node failures. After a NRS node
   fails, the NRS system must be able to restore the name records
   stored in the NRS node. The NRS must also ensure resolution failure
   at one NRS node would be resolved and corrected by other NRS nodes.

   For example, in the standalone name resolution approach, when a NRS
   overlay server fails, the name records should be able to transferred
   and recovered in its peer server or its replacement. In the name
   based approach, the failure of one ICN router does not cause much
   trouble in the name resolution, because the other alternative paths
   can be established that bypass the failed ICN router. However, it
   requires that the ICN router has propagated its name based routing
   information in the network.

4.1.6. Resolution guarantee

   The NRS must ensure the name resolution success if the matching
   content exists in the network, regardless of its popularity, number
   of cached copies.

Internet-Draft            NRS Requirements                  March 2017


4.1.7. Accuracy

   The NRS must provide accurate and up-to-date information on how to
   reach the producer(s) of requested content with minimum overhead in
   propagating the update information. Content mobility and expiration
   must be reflected in the corresponding records in the NRS system
   with minimum delay to guarantee the accurate resolution.

   For example, a content can be moved from one domain to another
   domain due to the mobility of the producer, then the old name record
   should be deleted from the NRS system and a new name record should
   be added and updated with minimum delay.

4.1.8. Heterogeneity

   There are heterogeneous content naming schemes[16][19] and name
   resolution approaches from different ICN architectures. For example:

   - Names in DONA[1] consist of the cryptographic hash of the
   principal's public key P and a label L uniquely identifying the
   information with respect to the principal. Name resolution in DONA
   is provided by specialized servers called Resolution Handlers (RHs).

   - Content in PURSUIT[5] is identified by a combination of a scope ID
   and a rendezvous ID. The scope ID represents the boundaries of a
   defined dissemination strategy for the content it contain. The
   rendezvous ID is the actual identity for a particular content. Name
   resolution in PURSUIT is handled by a collection of Rendezvous Nodes
   (RNs), which are implemented as a hierarchical Dynamic Hash Table
   (DHT)[13][14].

   - Names in NDN/CCN[8][10] are hierarchical and may be similar to
   URLs. Each name component can be anything, including a dotted human-
   readable string or a hash value. NDN/CCN adopts the name based
   routing. The NDN router forwards the interest by doing the longest-
   match lookup in the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) based on the
   content name and the interest is stored in the Pending Interest
   Table (PIT).

   - In MobilityFirst[9], every network entity, content has a Global
   Unique Identifier (GUID). GUIDs are flat 160-bit strings with no
   semantic structure. Name Resolution in MobilityFirst all is carried
   out via a Global Name Resolution Service (GNRS).

   Although the existing naming schemes are different, they all need to
   provide basic functions for identifying a content, supporting trust
   provenance, content lookup and routing. The NRS may combine the

Internet-Draft            NRS Requirements                  March 2017


   advantages of different mechanisms. The NRS may be able to provide a
   generic naming schema to resolve any type of content name, either it
   is flat or hierarchical.

4.1.9. Unspecified content name

   Currently, both the standalone name resolution and name based
   routing approaches assume that the content name is known (or
   potentially retrieved from some other service) and specified to the
   network by the client, which is sometimes not the case. A client may
   not know the exact name of the data that he/she is requesting. For
   example, a client wants to retrieve the temperature data on
   07/21/2015 in San Diego. In this case, the client is only able to
   specify some semantics and contextual information of the data that
   he/she is looking for.

   The NRS may be able to resolve those requests by having a northbound
   interface to the other services, which can return the content
   name(s) matching the client's request.



4.2. Requirements on Manageability

   Requirements on manageability are things that should be considered
   in terms of the system management aspect.

4.2.1. Manageability

   NRS has to be manageable since some parts of the system may grow or
   shrink dynamically and a name resolution server may be added or
   deleted.

4.2.2. Deployability

   Deployability is important for a real world system. If the NRS can
   be deployed from the edges, then the deployment can be simplified.

4.2.3. Interoperability

   Considering the emergence of IoT applications, many standard bodies
   for IoT have settled their ways for resource/data management. For
   example:

   - oneM2M[19] uses tree structure to store resources. Each resource
   is addressable by its URI. oneM2M resources are linked together by
   parent-child relationship or link relationship with pointers.


Hong, et al.         Expires September 14, 2017              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft            NRS Requirements                  March 2017


   Resource resolution is indicated in the hierarchical name of the
   resources. With one entrance, a client can go anywhere within the
   tree structure. As an example, a content is stored under the
   container with URI prefix of /CSEBase-ID/AE-ID/container
   ID/contentInstance-ID. From the URI of the content, a client would
   be able to easily do the name resolution and go to the oneM2M server
   identified by CSEBase-ID.

   - IETF CoRE[21] specifies the Resource Directory (RD) [23] for
   resource registration and resolution. A RD is a database that stores
   links about resources hosted by endpoints (EP), which are called RD
   entries. An EP is a server that is associated with a scheme (e.g.
   CoAP[22] by default, or HTTP), IP address and port.

   It is likely that a physical IoT node may host one or more Eps. The
   RD provides a set of RESTful interface for EPs to register and
   maintain sets of RD entries, and for clients to look up resources.

   In order for the ICN infrastructure to support IoT applications, the
   NRS should provide the interoperability between those existing
   resource registries as well as integration of them into the ICN
   infrastructure. The NRS should allow different providers to coexist
   and for requesters to choose one or more preferred providers on
   their own.

4.2.4. Support for manifest

   The NRS should support resolution using manifests. Namely, if a
   content object is described by a manifest, the NRS should support
   efficient recursive resolution of the names included in the
   manifest. Alternatively, if the manifest contains mapping of content
   names to location (for instance, DASH manifest may contain
   additional Base URL for a specific content stream), then this should
   be consistent with the mapping obtained from the NRS.

4.2.5. Resolution result selection

   The NRS may be able to return some of the active producers or all of
   them for the client's selection or select the best producer based on
   the client's criteria and context information, e.g. producer with
   least load, with least response time, etc.

Internet-Draft            NRS Requirements                  March 2017


4.3. Requirements on Security

   Requirements on security are things that should be considered in
   terms of the security aspect for both the node and data.



4.3.1. Accessibility

   The NRS system must be prevented from the malicious users attempting
   to hijack or corrupt name records.

   The name records must have proper access rights such that the
   information contained in the name record would not be revealed to
   unauthorized users.

   The name records may be associated within certain domain, and cannot
   be propagated outside the domain. For example, for content that is
   only shared within the community should be restricted within the
   community network, outside of which the content may not exist.

4.3.2. Authentication

   Users/nodes that register themselves with NRS server require the
   authentication to ensure who claims to be. For example, the attacker
   can act as a fake NRS server which causes disruption or intercepts
   the data.

4.3.3. Data confidentiality

   NRS has to keep the data confidentiality to prevent a lot of
   sensitive data from reaching unauthorized data requestor in IoT
   environment.

4.3.4. Privacy

   When a private data is registered in the system, NRS has to support
   the privacy to avoid the information leaking. Otherwise,
   unauthorized entity may disclose the privacy.

5. Use cases of NRS

   In this section, we describe usages of NRS in the ICN literature.

5.1. Flat Name routing support

   In ICN, data objects must be identified by names regardless their
   location or container [RFC 7927] and the names are divided into two
   types of schemes: hierarchical and flat namespaces. A hierarchical
   scheme used in CCN and NDN architectures has a structure similar to
   current URIs, where the hierarchy improves scalability of routing
   system. It is because the hierarchy enables aggregation of the name
   resulting in reducing the size of RIB or FIB as similar to IP
   routing system.

   In a flat scheme, on the other hand, name routing is not easy since
   names in a flat namespace cannot be aggregated anymore, which would
   cause more the scalability problem in routing system. In order to
   address such problem, a flat name is resolved to some information
   which is routable through NRS or a sort of NRS in various ICN
   literatures.

   In PURSUIT [5], names are flat and the rendezvous functions are
   defined for NRS, which is implemented by a set of Rendezvous Nodes
   (RNs), the Rendezvous Network (RENE). Thus a name consisted of a
   sequence of scope IDs and a single rendezvous ID is routed by RNs in
   RENE. Thus, PURSUIT decouples name resolution and data routing,
   where NRS is performed by the RENE.

   In MobilityFirst [9], a name called a global unique Identifier
   (GUID) derived from a human-readable name via a global naming
   service is flat typed 160-bits strings with self-certifying
   function. Thus, MobilityFirst defines a global name resolution
   service (GNRS) which resolves GUIDs to network addresses and
   decouples name resolution and data routing as similar to PURSUIT.

5.2. Publisher Mobility support

   In ICN literature, it is said that mobility can be achieved in
   fundamental feature of ICN. Especially, consumer or client mobility
   can be achieved by allowing information requests to basic procedure
   from different interfaces or through attachment point of the new
   network. Moreover, seamless mobility service in ICN ensures that
   content reception continues without any disruption in ICN
   application, so in consumer point of view, seamless mobility can be
   easily supported.



Hong, et al.         Expires September 14, 2017              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft            NRS Requirements                  March 2017


   However, producer or publisher mobility in ICN is more complicated
   to be supported. If a publisher moves into different authority
   domain or network location, then the request for a content published
   by the moving publisher with origin name would be hardly forwarded
   to the moving publisher. Especially in a hierarchical name scheme,
   publisher mobility support is much harder than in a flat name scheme
   since the routing tables related in broad area should be updated
   according to the publisher movement. Therefore, various ICN
   literatures would adopt NRS to achieve the publisher mobility, where
   NRS can be implemented in different ways such as rendezvous
   mechanism, mapping, etc.

   In NDN, for publisher mobility support, rendezvous mechanisms have
   been proposed to build interests rendezvous (RV) with data generated
   by a mobile producer (MP) [36]. There can be classified two
   approaches such as chase mobile producer and rendezvous data.
   Regarding MP chasing, rendezvous acts as a mapping service that
   provides the mapping from the name of the data produced by the MP to
   the MP's current point of attachment (PoA) name. Alternatively, the
   RV serves as a home agent like as IP mobility support, so the RV
   enables consumer's interest message to tunnel towards the MP at the
   PoA. Regarding rendezvous data, moving the data produced by the MP
   have been hosting at data depot instead of forwarding interest
   messages. Thus a consumer's interest message can be forwarded to
   stationary place as called data rendezvous, so it would either
   return the data or fetch it using another mapping solution.
   Therefore, RV or other mapping functions are in the role of NRS in
   NDN.

   In [37], forwarding-label (FL) object is referred to enable
   identifier (ID) and locator (LID) namespaces to be split in ICN.
   Generally, IDs are managed by applications, while locators are
   managed by a network administrator, so that IDs are mapping to
   heterogeneous name schemes and LIDs are mapping to network domains
   or specific network elements. Thus the proposed FL object acts as a
   locator (LID) and provides the flexibility to forward Interest
   messages through mapping service between IDs and LIDs. Therefore,
   the mapping service in control plane infrastructure can be
   considered as NRS in this draft.

   In MobilityFirst [9], both consumer and publisher mobility can be
   primarily handled by the global name resolution service (GNRS) which
   resolves GUIDs to network addresses. Thus, the GNRS  must be updated
   for mobility support when a network attached object changes its
   point of attachment, which differs from NDN/CCN.

Internet-Draft            NRS Requirements                  March 2017


5.3. Scalable Routing support

   In ICN, application names identifying contents are used directly for
   packet delivery, so ICN routers run a name-based routing protocol to
   build name-based routing and forwarding tables. As same as
   scalability of IP routing, if non-aggregated name prefixes are
   injected to the Default Route Free Zone (DFZ) of ICN, then they
   would be driving the growth of the DFZ routing table size. Thus a
   solution to keep the routing table size under control is needed,
   which can be done by defining indirection layer.

   In [38], a well-known concept of Map-and-Encap is applied to provide
   a simple and secure namespace mapping solution to address the
   routing scalability problem in NDN's DFZ. In the proposed map-and-
   encap design, data whose name prefixes do not exist in the DFZ
   forwarding table can be retrieved by a distributed mapping system
   called NDNS, which maintains and lookups the mapping information
   from a name to its globally routed prefixes. Therefore, NDNS is a
   kind of NRS.



5.4. Nameless object support

   In CCNx 1.0, the concept of "Nameless Objects" that are a Content
   Object without a Name is introduced to provide a means to move
   Content between storage replicas without having to rename or re-sign
   the content objects for the new name. Nameless Objects can be
   addressed by the ContentObjectHash that is to restrict Content
   Object matching by using SHA-256 hash [39].

   An Interest message would still carry a Name and a
   ContentObjectHash, where a Name is used for routing, while a
   ContentObjectHash is used for matching. However, on the reverse
   path, if the Content Object's name is missing, it is a "Nameless
   Object" and only matches against the ContentObjectHash. Therefore, a
   consumer needs to resolve proper name and hashes through an outside
   system, which can be considered as NRS.

   This document makes no specific request of IANA.



8. Conclusions

   In this draft, we broaden the definition of NRS in the ICN
   infrastructure as the service which can help a client to reach a
   producer of the requested content. Thus the NRS could take the
   approaches of standalone name resolution, name based routing or
   hybrid of the two. With the essence of NRS, it is urgent to identify
   the requirements for the NRS design in ICN. In the draft, we propose
   the NRS requirements from the different aspects and elaborate each
   of them with examples for verification of its importance. We also
   discuss the use cases of NRS in the ICN literature.
