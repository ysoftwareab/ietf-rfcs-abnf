Internet-Draft          Net2Cloud Gap Analysis             October 2018


1. Introduction

   [Net2Cloud-Problem] describes the problems that enterprises face
   today in transitioning their IT infrastructure to support digital
   economy, such as connecting enterprises' branch offices to dynamic
   workloads in different Cloud DCs.

   This document analyzes the technological gaps to interconnect
   dynamic workloads & apps hosted in various locations, especially in
   cloud data centers that the enterprise existing VPN service
   providers might not have the physical infrastructure to reach.

   For ease of description, SD-WAN edge node and CPE are used
   interchangeably throughout this document.



2. Conventions used in this document

   Cloud DC:   Off-Premise Data Centers that usually host applications
               and workload owned by different organizations or
               tenants.



   Controller: Used interchangeably with SD-WAN controller to manage
               SD-WAN overlay path creation/deletion and monitor the
               path conditions between sites.

   CPE-Based VPN: Virtual Private Secure network formed among CPEs.
               This is to differentiate from most commonly used PE-
               based VPNs a la RFC 4364.

   OnPrem:     On Premises data centers and branch offices

   SD-WAN:     Software Defined Wide Area Network, which can mean many
               different things. In this document, "SD-WAN" refers to
               the solutions specified by ONUG (Open Network User
               Group), which build point-to-point IPsec overlay paths
               between two end-points (or branch offices) that need to
               intercommunicate.

3. Gap Analysis of CPEs Registration Protocol

   SD-WAN, conceived in ONUG (Open Network User Group) a few years ago
   as a means to aggregate multiple connections between any two points,
   has emerged as an on-demand technology to securely interconnect the
   OnPrem branches with the workloads instantiated in Cloud DCs that do
   not connect to BGP/MPLS VPN PEs or have very limited bandwidth.

   Some SD-WAN networks use the NHRP protocol [RFC2332] to register SD-
   WAN endpoints with a "Controller" (or NHRP server), which then has
   the ability to map a private VPN address to a public IP address of
   the destination node. DSVPN [DSVPN] or DMVPN [DMVPN] are used to
   establish tunnels among SD-WAN endpoints.

   NHRP was originally intended for ATM address resolution, and as a
   result, it misses many attributes that are necessary for dynamic
   endpoint CPE registration to controller, such as:

   - Location identifier, such as Site Identifier, System ID, and/or Port ID.
   - CPE-attached GW information. When a CPE is instantiated within a Cloud
     DC, the Cloud DC operator's Gateway to which the CPE is attached.
   - CPE attached NAT properties if the CPE is using private addresses, such
     as the NAT type, Private address, Public address, Private port, Public
     port, etc. which are needed when the CPEs use private addresses.
   - IPsec attributes, which are needed for peers to build Security
     Associations.
   - CPE supported encapsulation types, such as IPsec-GRE, IPsec-VxLAN, or
     others.


   [BGP-SDWAN-EXT] describes the protocol extension for SD-WAN edge
   nodes to advertise its tunnel end-point properties to other SD-WAN
   edge nodes with which they need communication.

4. Gap Analysis in aggregating VPN paths and Internet paths

   Most likely, enterprises, especially large ones, already have their
   CPEs interconnected by providers' VPNs, such as EVPN, L2VPN, or
   L3VPN. The VPN can be PE based or CPE based as shown in the

   following diagram. The commonly used CPE-based VPNs have CPE
   directly attached to PEs, therefore the communication is considered
   as secure. BGP can (also) be used to distribute routes among CPEs,
   even though sometimes routes among CPEs are statically configured.

                      Figure 1: L2 or L3 VPNs over IP WAN



   To use SD-WAN to aggregate Internet routes with the VPN routes, the
   CPEs need to have some ports connected to PEs and other ports
   connected to the Internet. NHRP & DSVPN/DMVPN can be used for the
   CPEs to be registered with their SD-WAN Controllers to establish
   secure tunnels among relevant CPEs.

   That means the CPEs need to participate in two separate control
   planes: EVPN&BGP for CPE-based VPNs via links directly attached to
   PEs and NHRP & DSVPN/DMVPN. Two separate control planes not only add
   complexity to CPEs, but also increase operational cost.

 4.1. Gap analysis of Using BGP to cover SD-WAN paths

   Since BGP is widely deployed, it is desirable to consider using BGP
   to control the SD-WAN paths instead of NHRP and DSVPN/DMVPN. This
   section analyzes the gaps of using BGP to control SD-WAN.

   RFC5512 and [Tunnel-Encap] describe methods for endpoints to
   advertise tunnel information and to trigger tunnel establishment.
   RFC5512 & [Tunnel-Encaps] have the Endpoint Address to indicate IPv4
   or IPv6 address format, the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute to
   indicate different encapsulation formats, such as L2TPv3, GRE,
   VxLAN, IP-in-IP, etc. There are sub-TLVs to describe the detailed
   tunnel information for each of the encapsulations.

   [Tunnel-Encaps] removed SAFI =7 (which was specified by RFC5512) for
   distributing encapsulation tunnel information. [Tunnel-Encap]
   require Tunnels being associated with routes.

   There is also the Color sub-TLV to describe customer-specified
   information about the tunnels (which can be creatively used for SD-
   WAN)

   To express the support of multiple Encap types, multiple Extended
   BGP communities with SAFI value = 7 can be used.

   Here are some of the gaps using [Tunnel-Encap] to control SD-WAN:


Dunbar, et al.             Expires Jan 2019                    [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          Net2Cloud Gap Analysis             October 2018


   - The mechanisms described by [Tunnel-Encap] cannot be effectively used
     for SD-WAN overlay network because a SD-WAN Tunnel needs to be
     established before data arrival. There is no routes to be associated
     with the SD-WAN Tunnel.
     There is a suggestion on using a "Fake Route" for a SD-WAN node to
     use [Tunnel-Encap] to advertise its SD-WAN tunnel end-points
     properties. However, using "Fake Route" can create deployment
     complexity for large SD-WAN networks with many tunnels. For
     example, for a SD-WAN network with hundreds of nodes, with each
     node having many ports & many end-points to establish SD-WAN
     tunnels to their corresponding peers, the node would need many
     "fake addresses". For large SD-WAN networks (such as has more than
     10000 nodes), each node might need 10's thousands of "fake
     addresses", which is very difficult to manage and needs lots of
     configuration to get the nodes provisioned.

   -
   - Doesn't have fields to carry detailed information of the remote CPE:
     such as Site-ID, System-ID, Port-ID
   - Does not have the proper field to express IPsec attributes among the SD-
     WAN edge nodes to establish proper IPsec Security Associations.
   - Does not have proper way for two peer CPEs to negotiate IPSec keys,
     based on the configuration sent by the Controller.
   - UDP NAT private address <-> public address mapping
   - CPEs tend to communicate with a few other CPEs, not all the CPEs need to
     form mesh connections.  Without any BGP extension, many nodes can get
     dumped with too much information of other nodes that they never need to
     communicate with.
     .

   [VPN-over-Internet] describes a way to securely interconnect CPEs
   via IPsec using BGP. This method is useful, however, it still misses
   some aspects to aggregate CPE-based VPN routes with internet routes
   that interconnect the CPEs. In addition:

  -  The draft assumes that CPE "registers" with the RR. However, it does not
     say how. It assumes that the remote CPEs are pre-configured with the
     IPsec SA manually. In SD-WAN, Zero Touch Provisioning is expected. It is
     not acceptable to require manual configuration.
  -  For RR communication with CPE, this draft only mentioned IPSec. Missing
     TLS/DTLS.
  -  The draft assumes that CPEs and RR are connected with an IPsec tunnel.
     With zero touch provisioning, we need an automatic way to synchronize the
     IPsec SA between CPE and RR. The draft assumes:



Dunbar, et al.             Expires Jan 2019                    [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          Net2Cloud Gap Analysis             October 2018


          A CPE must also be provisioned with whatever additional information
          is needed in order to set up an IPsec SA with each of the red RRs

  -  IPsec requires periodic refreshment of the keys. to the draft hasn't
     addressed how to synchronize the refreshment among multiple nodes.
  -  IPsec usually only sends configuration parameters to two endpoints and
     let the two endpoints negotiate the KEY. Now we assume that RR is
     responsible for creating the KEY for all endpoints. When one endpoint is
     compromised, all other connections are impacted.


 4.2. Gaps in preventing attacks from Internet facing ports

   When CPEs have ports facing Internet, it brings in the security
   risks of potential DDoS attacks to the CPEs from the ports facing
   internet.

   To mitigate security risks, it is absolutely necessary to enable
   Anti-DDoS features on those CPEs to prevent major DDoS attacks.

5. Gap analysis of CPEs not directly connected to VPN PEs

   Because of the ephemeral property of the selected Cloud DCs, an
   enterprise or its network service provider may not have the direct
   links to the Cloud DCs that are optimal for hosting the enterprise's
   specific workloads/Apps. Under those circumstances, SD-WAN is a very
   flexible choice to interconnect the enterprise on-premises data
   centers & branch offices to its desired Cloud DCs.

   However, SD-WAN paths over public Internet can have unpredictable
   performance, especially over long distances and across domains.
   Therefore, it is highly desirable to place as much as possible the
   portion of SD-WAN paths over service provider VPN (e.g.,
   enterprise's existing VPN) that have guaranteed SLA to minimize the
   distance/segments over public Internet.

   MEF Cloud Service Architecture [MEF-Cloud] also describes a use case
   of network operators needing to use SD-WAN over LTE or public
   Internet for last mile accesses where they are not present.

   Under those scenarios, one or both of the SD-WAN endpoints may not
   directly be attached to the PEs of a SR Domain.

Internet-Draft          Net2Cloud Gap Analysis             October 2018


   Using SD-WAN to connect the enterprise existing sites with the
   workloads in Cloud DC, the enterprise existing sites' CPEs have to
   be upgraded to support SD-WAN.  If the workloads in Cloud DC need to
   be connected to many sites, the upgrade process can be very
   expensive.

   [Net2Cloud-Problem] describes a hybrid network approach that
   integrates SD-WAN with traditional MPLS-based VPNs, to extend the
   existing MPLS-based VPNs to the Cloud DC Workloads over the access
   paths that are not under the VPN provider control. To make it work
   properly, a small number of the PEs of the MPLS VPN can be
   designated to connect to the remote workloads via SD-WAN secure
   IPsec tunnels.  Those designated PEs are shown as fPE (floating PE
   or smart PE) in Figure 3. Once the secure IPsec tunnels are
   established, the workloads in Cloud DC can be reached by the
   enterprise's VPN without upgrading all of the enterprise's existing
   CPEs. The only CPE that needs to support SD-WAN would be a
   virtualized CPE instantiated within the cloud DC.

   In Figure 3, the optimal Cloud DC to host the workloads (due to
   proximity, capacity, pricing, or other criteria chosen by the
   enterprises) does not happen to have a direct connection to the PEs
   of the MPLS VPN that interconnects the enterprise's existing sites.


5.1. Gap Analysis of Floating PEs to connect to Remote CPEs

   To extend MPLS VPNs to remote CPEs, it is necessary to establish
   secure tunnels (such as IPsec tunnels) between the Floating PEs and
   the remote CPEs.

   Gap:

   Even though a set of PEs can be manually selected to act as the
   floating PEs for a specific cloud data center, there are no standard
   protocols for those PEs to interact with the remote CPEs (most
   likely virtualized) instantiated in the third party cloud data
   centers (such as exchanging performance or route information).

   When there is more than one fPE available for use (as there should
   be for resiliency or the ability to support multiple cloud DCs
   scattered geographically), it is not straightforward to designate an
   egress fPE to remote CPEs based on applications.  There is too much
   applications' traffic traversing PEs, and it is not feasible for PEs
   to recognize applications from the payload of packets.


5.2. NAT Traversal

   Most cloud DCs only assign private addresses to the workloads
   instantiated. Therefore, traffic to/from the workload usually need
   to traverse NAT.
   A SD-WAN edge node can inquire STUN (Session Traversal of UDP
   Through Network Address Translation RFC 3489) Server to get the NAT
   property, the public IP address and the Public Port number to pass
   to peers.

5.3. Complication of using BGP between PEs and remote CPEs via Internet

   Even though an EBGP (external BGP) Multi-hop design can be used to
   connect peers that are not directly connected to each other, there
   are still some complications/gaps in extending BGP from MPLS VPN PEs
   to remote CPEs via any access paths (e.g., Internet).

   The path between the remote CPEs and VPN PE can traverse untrusted
   nodes.

   EBGP Multi-hop scheme requires static configuration on both peers.
   To use EBGP between a PE and remote CPEs, the PE has to be manually
   configured with the "next-hop" set to the IP addresses of the CPEs.
   When remote CPEs, especially remote virtualized CPEs are dynamically
   instantiated or removed, the configuration on the PE Multi-Hop EBGP
   has to be changed accordingly.

   Gap:

     Egress peering engineering (EPE) is not enough. Running BGP on
     virtualized CPEs in Cloud DC requires GRE tunnels being
     established first, which in turn requires address and key
     management for the remote CPEs. RFC 7024 (Virtual Hub & Spoke) and
     Hierarchical VPN is not enough.

     Also there is a need for a method to automatically trigger
     configuration changes on PE when remote CPEs' are instantiated or
     moved (leading to an IP address change) or deleted.

     EBGP Multi-hop scheme does not have an embedded security
     mechanism. The PE and remote CPEs need secure communication
     channels when connecting via the public Internet.

   Remote CPEs, if instantiated in Cloud DC, might have to traverse NAT
   to reach PE. It is not clear how BGP can be used between devices
   outside the NAT and the entities behind the NAT. It is not clear how
   to configure the Next Hop on the PEs to reach private IPv4
   addresses.




5.4. Designated Forwarder to the remote edges

   Among multiple floating PEs available for a remote CPE, multicast
   traffic from the remote CPE towards the MPLS VPN can be forwarded
   back to the remote CPE due to the PE receiving the multicast data
   frame forwarding the multicast/broadcast frame to other PEs that in
   turn send to all attached CPEs. This process may cause traffic loop.

   Therefore, it is necessary to designate one floating PE as the CPE's
   Designated Forwarder, similar to TRILL's Appointed Forwarders
   [RFC6325].

   Gap: the MPLS VPN does not have features like TRILL's Appointed
   Forwarders.

5.5. Traffic Path Management

   When there are multiple floating PEs that have established IPsec
   tunnels to the remote CPE, the remote CPE can forward the outbound
   traffic to the Designated Forwarder PE, which in turn forwards the

   traffic to egress PEs to the destinations. However, it is not
   straightforward for the egress PE to send back the return traffic to
   the Designated Forwarder PE.

   Example of Return Path management using Figure 3 above.

   - fPE-1 is DF for communication between App-1 <-> Host-a due to
   latency, pricing or other criteria.
   - fPE-2 is DF for communication between App-1 <-> Host-b.



6. Manageability Considerations

      Zero touch provisioning of SD-WAN edge nodes is expected in SD-
     WAN deployment. It is necessary for a newly powered up SD-WAN
     edges to establish a secure connection (such as TLS, DTLS, etc.)
     to its controller.

7. Security Considerations

     The intention of this draft is to identify the gaps in current and
     proposed SD-WAN approaches that can address requirements
     identified in [Net2Cloud-problem].

     Several of these approaches have gaps in meeting enterprise
     security requirements when tunneling their traffic over the
     Internet, as is the general intention of SD-WAN. See the
     individual sections above for further discussion of these security
     gaps.
