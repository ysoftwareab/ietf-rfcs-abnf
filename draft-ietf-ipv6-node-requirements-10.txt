Abstract

   This document defines requirements for IPv6 nodes.  It is expected
   that IPv6 will be deployed in a wide range of devices and
   situations.  Specifying the requirements for IPv6 nodes allows IPv6
   to function well and interoperate in a large number of situations
   and deployments.

1. Introduction

   The goal of this document is to define the common functionality
   required from both IPv6 hosts and routers.  Many IPv6 nodes will
   implement optional or additional features, but all IPv6 nodes can be
   expected to implement the mandatory requirements listed in this
   document.

   This document tries to avoid discussion of protocol details, and
   references RFCs for this purpose.  In case of any conflicting text,
   this document takes less precedence than the normative RFCs, unless
   additional clarifying text is included in this document.

   Although the document points to different specifications, it should
   be noted that in most cases, the granularity of requirements are
   smaller than a single specification, as many specifications define
   multiple, independent pieces, some of which may not be mandatory.

   As it is not always possible for an implementer to know the exact
   usage of IPv6 in a node, an overriding requirement for IPv6 nodes is
   that they should adhere to Jon Postel's Robustness Principle:

      Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept
      from others [RFC-793].

1.1 Requirement Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC-
   2119].

1.2 Scope of this Document

   IPv6 covers many specifications.  It is intended that IPv6 will be
   deployed in many different situations and environments.  Therefore,
   it is important to develop the requirements for IPv6 nodes, in order
   to ensure interoperability.

   This document assumes that all IPv6 nodes meet the minimum
   requirements specified here.

1.3 Description of IPv6 Nodes

   From Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification [RFC-2460] we
   have the following definitions:

Internet-Draft


   An IPv6 node must include support for one or more IPv6 link-layer
   specifications.  Which link-layer specifications are included will
   depend upon what link-layers are supported by the hardware available
   on the system.  It is possible for a conformant IPv6 node to support
   IPv6 on some of its interfaces and not on others.

   As IPv6 is run over new layer 2 technologies, it is expected that
   new specifications will be issued.  This section highlights some
   major layer 2 technologies and is not intended to be complete.

3.1 Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks - RFC2464

   Nodes supporting IPv6 over Ethernet interfaces MUST implement
   Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks [RFC-2464].

3.2 IP version 6 over PPP - RFC2472

   Nodes supporting IPv6 over PPP MUST implement IPv6 over PPP [RFC-
   2472].

3.3 IPv6 over ATM Networks - RFC2492

   Nodes supporting IPv6 over ATM Networks MUST implement IPv6 over ATM
   Networks [RFC-2492].  Additionally, RFC 2492 states:

      A minimally conforming IPv6/ATM driver SHALL support the PVC mode
      of operation. An IPv6/ATM driver that supports the full SVC mode
      SHALL also support PVC mode of operation.

4. IP Layer

4.1 Internet Protocol Version 6 - RFC2460

   The Internet Protocol Version 6 is specified in [RFC-2460]. This
   specification MUST be supported.

   Unrecognized options in Hop-by-Hop Options or Destination Options
   extensions MUST be processed as described in RFC 2460.

   The node MUST follow the packet transmission rules in RFC 2460.

   Nodes MUST always be able to send, receive and process fragment
   headers.  All conformant IPv6 implementations MUST be capable of
   sending and receving IPv6 packets; forwarding functionality MAY be
   supported

   RFC 2460 specifies extension headers and the processing for these
   headers.



Loughney (editor)           August 12, 2004                    [Page 5]





Internet-Draft


      A full implementation of IPv6 includes implementation of the
      following extension headers: Hop-by-Hop Options, Routing (Type
      0), Fragment, Destination Options, Authentication and
      Encapsulating Security Payload. [RFC-2460]

   An IPv6 node MUST be able to process these headers.  It should be
   noted that there is some discussion about the use of Routing Headers
   and possible security threats [IPv6-RH] caused by them.

4.2 Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 - RFC2461

   Neighbor Discovery SHOULD be supported.  RFC 2461 states:

      "Unless specified otherwise (in a document that covers operating
      IP over a particular link type) this document applies to all link
      types. However, because ND uses link-layer multicast for some of
      its services, it is possible that on some link types (e.g., NBMA
      links) alternative protocols or mechanisms to implement those
      services will be specified (in the appropriate document covering
      the operation of IP over a particular link type).  The services
      described in this document that are not directly dependent on
      multicast, such as Redirects, Next-hop determination, Neighbor
      Unreachability Detection, etc., are expected to be provided as
      specified in this document.  The details of how one uses ND on
      NBMA links is an area for further study."

   Some detailed analysis of Neighbor Discovery follows:

   Router Discovery is how hosts locate routers that reside on an
   attached link. Router Discovery MUST be supported for
   implementations.

   Prefix Discovery is how hosts discover the set of address prefixes
   that define which destinations are on-link for an attached link.
   Prefix discovery MUST be supported for implementations. Neighbor
   Unreachability Detection (NUD) MUST be supported for all paths
   between hosts and neighboring nodes. It is not required for paths
   between routers.  However, when a node receives a unicast Neighbor
   Solicitation (NS) message (that may be a NUD's NS), the node MUST
   respond to it (i.e. send a unicast Neighbor Advertisement).

   Duplicate Address Detection MUST be supported on all links
   supporting link-layer multicast (RFC2462 section 5.4 specifies DAD
   MUST take place on all unicast addresses).

   A host implementation MUST support sending Router Solicitations.

   Receiving and processing Router Advertisements MUST be supported for



Loughney (editor)           August 12, 2004                    [Page 6]





Internet-Draft


   host implementations. The ability to understand specific Router
   Advertisement options is dependent on supporting the specification
   where the RA is specified.

   Sending and Receiving Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor
   Advertisement (NA) MUST be supported. NS and NA messages are
   required for Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).

   Redirect functionality SHOULD be supported. If the node is a router,
   Redirect functionality MUST be supported.

4.3 Path MTU Discovery & Packet Size

4.3.1 Path MTU Discovery - RFC1981

   Path MTU Discovery [RFC-1981] SHOULD be supported, though minimal
   implementations MAY choose to not support it and avoid large
   packets.  The rules in RFC 2460 MUST be followed for packet
   fragmentation and reassembly.

4.3.2 IPv6 Jumbograms - RFC2675

   IPv6 Jumbograms [RFC-2675] MAY be supported.

4.4  ICMP for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) - RFC2463

   ICMPv6 [RFC-2463] MUST be supported.

4.5 Addressing

4.5.1 IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture - RFC3513

   The IPv6 Addressing Architecture [RFC-3513] MUST be supported as
   updated by [DEP-SL].

4.5.2 IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration - RFC2462

   IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration is defined in [RFC-2462].
   This specification MUST be supported for nodes that are hosts.

   Nodes that are routers MUST be able to generate link local addresses
   as described in RFC 2462 [RFC-2462].

   From 2462:

      The autoconfiguration process specified in this document applies
      only to hosts and not routers. Since host autoconfiguration uses
      information advertised by routers, routers will need to be



Loughney (editor)           August 12, 2004                    [Page 7]





Internet-Draft


      configured by some other means. However, it is expected that
      routers will generate link-local addresses using the mechanism
      described in this document. In addition, routers are expected to
      successfully pass the Duplicate Address Detection procedure
      described in this document on all addresses prior to assigning
      them to an interface.

   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) MUST be supported.

4.5.3 Privacy Extensions for Address Configuration in IPv6 - RFC3041

   Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [RFC-
   3041] SHOULD be supported.  It is recommended that this behavior be
   configurable on a connection basis within each application when
   available.  It is noted that a number of applications do not work
   with addresses generated with this method, while other applications
   work quite well with them.

4.5.4 Default Address Selection for IPv6 - RFC3484

   The rules specified in the Default Address Selection for IPv6 [RFC-
   3484] document MUST be implemented. It is expected that IPv6 nodes
   will need to deal with multiple addresses.

4.5.5 Stateful Address Autoconfiguration

   Stateful Address Autoconfiguration MAY be supported. DHCPv6 [RFC-
   3315] is the standard stateful address configuration protocol; see
   section 5.3 for DHCPv6 support.

   Nodes which do not support Stateful Address Autoconfiguration may be
   unable to obtain any IPv6 addresses aside from link-local addresses
   when it receives a router advertisement with the 'M' flag (Managed
   address configuration) set and which contains no prefixes advertised
   for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (see section 4.5.2).
   Additionally, such nodes will be unable to obtain other
   configuration information such as the addresses of DNS servers when
   it is connected to a link over which the node receives a router
   advertisement in which the 'O' flag ("Other stateful configuration")
   is set.

4.6 Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPv6 - RFC2710

   Nodes that need to join multicast groups SHOULD implement MLDv2
   [MLDv2]. However, if the node has applications, which only need
   support for Any-Source Multicast [RFC3569], the node MAY implement
   MLDv1 [MLDv1] instead. If the node has applications, which need
   support for Source-Specific Multicast [RFC3569, SSMARCH], the node



Loughney (editor)           August 12, 2004                    [Page 8]





Internet-Draft


   MUST support MLDv2 [MLDv2].

   When MLD is used, the rules in "Source Address Selection for the
   Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) Protocol" [RFC-3590] MUST be
   followed.

4.7 Special header fields

   If a node supports the Traffic Class field, it MUST do so in
   accordance with [RFC-2474], [RFC-3168], or both. Hosts that do not
   support this field MUST set it to zero when sending packets. Routers
   that do not support this field MUST NOT change its value when
   forwarding packets.

   If a node supports the Flow Label field, it MUST do so in accordance
   with [RFC-3697]. Hosts that do not support this field MUST set it to
   zero when sending packets. Routers that do not support this field
   MUST NOT change its value when forwarding packets.

5. DNS and DHCP

5.1 DNS

   DNS is described in [RFC-1034], [RFC-1035], [RFC-3152], [RFC-3363]
   and [RFC-3596].  Not all nodes will need to resolve names, and those
   that will never need to resolve DNS names do not need to implement
   resolver functionality.  However, the ability to resolve names is a
   basic infrastructure capability that applications rely on and
   generally needs to be supported.  All nodes that need to resolve
   names SHOULD implement stub-resolver [RFC-1034] functionality, in
   RFC 1034 section 5.3.1 with support for:

    - AAAA type Resource Records [RFC-3596];
    - reverse addressing in ip6.arpa using PTR records [RFC-3152];
    - EDNS0 [RFC-2671] to allow for DNS packet sizes larger than 512
      octets.

   Those nodes are RECOMMENDED to support DNS security extentions
   [DNSSEC-INTRO], [DNSSEC-REC] and [DNSSEC-PROT].

   Those nodes are NOT RECOMMENDED to support the experimental A6 and
   DNAME Resource Records [RFC-3363].

5.2 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) - RFC3315

5.2.1 Managed Address Configuration

   The method by which IPv6 Nodes that use DHCP for address assignment



Loughney (editor)           August 12, 2004                    [Page 9]





Internet-Draft


   can obtain IPv6 addresses and other configuration information upon
   receipt of a Router Advertisement with the 'M' flag set is described
   in section 5.5.3 of RFC 2462.

   In addition, in the absence of a router, those IPv6 Nodes that use
   DHCP for address assignment MUST initiate DHCP to obtain IPv6
   addresses and other configuration information, as described in
   section 5.5.2 of RFC 2462.  Those IPv6 nodes that do not use DHCP
   for address assignment can ignore the 'M' flag in Router
   Advertisements.

5.2.2 Other Configuration Information

   The method by which IPv6 Nodes that use DHCP to obtain other
   configuration information can obtain other configuration information
   upon receipt of a Router Advertisement with the 'O' flag set is
   described in section 5.5.3 of RFC 2462.

   Those IPv6 Nodes that use DHCP to obtain other configuration
   information initiate DHCP for other configuration information upon
   receipt of a Router Advertisement with the 'O' flag set, as
   described in section 5.5.3 of RFC 2462.  Those IPv6 nodes that do
   not use DHCP for other configuration information can ignore the 'O'
   flag in Router Advertisements.

   An IPv6 Node can use the subset of DHCP described in [DHCPv6-SL] to
   obtain other configuration information.

5.3.3 Use of Router Advertisements in Managed Environments

   Nodes using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6
   (DHCPv6) are expected to determine their default router information
   and on-link prefix information from received Router Advertisements.

6. IPv4 Support and Transition

   IPv6 nodes MAY support IPv4.

6.1 Transition Mechanisms

6.1.1 Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers - RFC2893

   If an IPv6 node implements dual stack and tunneling, then RFC2893
   MUST be supported.

   RFC 2893 is currently being updated.

7. Mobile IP



Loughney (editor)           August 12, 2004                   [Page 10]





Internet-Draft


   The Mobile IPv6 [MIPv6] specification defines requirements for the
   following types of nodes:

       - mobile nodes
       - correspondent nodes with support for route optimization
       - home agents
       - all IPv6 routers

   Hosts MAY support mobile node functionality described in Section 8.5
   of [MIPv6], including support of generic packet tunneling [RFC-2473]
   and secure home agent communications [MIPv6-HASEC].

   Hosts SHOULD support route optimization requirements for
   correspondent nodes described in Section 8.2 of [MIPv6].

   Routers SHOULD support the generic mobility-related requirements for
   all IPv6 routers described in Section 8.3 of [MIPv6]. Routers MAY
   support the home agent functionality described in Section 8.4 of
   [MIPv6], including support of [RFC-2473] and [MIPv6-HASEC].

8. Security

   This section describes the specification of IPsec for the IPv6 node.

8.1 Basic Architecture

   Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol [RFC-2401] MUST be
   supported. RFC-2401 is being updated by the IPsec Working Group.

8.2 Security Protocols

   ESP [RFC-2406] MUST be supported. AH [RFC-2402] MUST be supported.
   RFC-2406 and RFC 2402 are being updated by the IPsec Working Group.


8.3 Transforms and Algorithms

   Current IPsec RFCs specify the support of transforms and algorithms
   for use with AH and ESP: NULL encryption, DES-CBC, HMAC-SHA-1-96,
   and HMAC-MD5-96.  However, "Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation
   Requirements For ESP And AH" [CRYPTREQ] contains the current set of
   mandatory to implement algorithms for ESP and AH.  It also specifies
   algorithms that should be implemented because they are likely to be
   promoted to mandatory at some future time.  IPv6 nodes SHOULD
   conform to the requirements in [CRYPTREQ] as well as the
   requirements specified below.

   Since ESP encryption and authentication are both optional, support



Loughney (editor)           August 12, 2004                   [Page 11]





Internet-Draft


   for the NULL encryption algorithm [RFC-2410] and the NULL
   authentication algorithm [RFC-2406] MUST be provided to maintain
   consistency with the way these services are negotiated. However,
   while authentication and encryption can each be NULL, they MUST NOT
   both be NULL.  The NULL encryption algorithm is also useful for
   debugging.

   The DES-CBC encryption algorithm [RFC-2405] SHOULD NOT be supported
   within ESP.  Security issues related to the use of DES are discussed
   in [DESDIFF], [DESINT], [DESCRACK].  DES-CBC is still listed as
   required by the existing IPsec RFCs, but updates to these RFCs will
   be published soon.  DES provides 56 bits of protection, which is no
   longer considered sufficient.

   The use of HMAC-SHA-1-96 algorithm [RFC-2404] within AH and ESP MUST
   be supported.  The use of HMAC-MD5-96 algorithm [RFC-2403] within AH
   and ESP MAY also be supported.

   The 3DES-CBC encryption algorithm [RFC-2451] does not suffer from
   the same security issues as DES-CBC, and the 3DES-CBC algorithm
   within ESP MUST be supported to ensure interoperability.

       The AES-128-CBC algorithm [RFC-3602] MUST also be supported
   within
       ESP.  AES-128 is expected to be a widely available, secure, and
       efficient algorithm.  While AES-128-CBC is not required by the
       current IPsec RFCs, it is expected to become required in the
   future.
8.4 Key Management Methods

   An implementation MUST support the manual configuration of the
   security key and SPI.  The SPI configuration is needed in order to
   delineate between multiple keys.

   Key management SHOULD be supported.  Examples of key management
   systems include IKEv1 [RFC-2407] [RFC-2408] [RFC-2409], IKEv2
   [IKEv2] and Kerberos; S/MIME and TLS include key management
   functions.

   Where key refresh, anti-replay features of AH and ESP, or on-demand
   creation        of Security Associations (SAs) is required,
   automated keying MUST be supported.

   Key management methods for multicast traffic are also being worked
   on by the MSEC WG.

9. Router-Specific Functionality




Loughney (editor)           August 12, 2004                   [Page 12]





Internet-Draft


   This section defines general host considerations for IPv6 nodes that
   act as routers.  Currently, this section does not discuss routing-
   specific requirements.

9.1 General

9.1.1 IPv6 Router Alert Option - RFC2711

   The IPv6 Router Alert Option [RFC-2711] is an optional IPv6 Hop-by-
   Hop Header that is used in conjunction with some protocols (e.g.,
   RSVP [RFC-2205], or MLD [RFC-2710]). The Router Alert option will
   need to be implemented whenever protocols that mandate its usage are
   implemented.  See Section 4.6.

9.1.2 Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 - RFC2461

   Sending Router Advertisements and processing Router Solicitation
   MUST be supported.

10. Network Management

   Network Management MAY be supported by IPv6 nodes.  However, for
   IPv6 nodes that are embedded devices, network management may be the
   only possibility to control these nodes.

10.1 Management Information Base Modules (MIBs)

   The following two MIBs SHOULD be supported by nodes that support an
   SNMP agent.

10.1.1  IP Forwarding Table MIB

   IP Forwarding Table MIB [RFC-2096BIS] SHOULD be supported by nodes
   that support an SNMP agent.

10.1.2 Management Information Base for the Internet Protocol (IP)

   IP MIB [RFC-2011BIS] SHOULD be supported by nodes that support an
   SNMP agent.

11. Security Considerations

   This draft does not affect the security of the Internet, but
   implementations of IPv6 are expected to support a minimum set of
   security features to ensure security on the Internet.  "IP Security
   Document Roadmap" [RFC-2411] is important for everyone to read.

   The security considerations in RFC2460 describe the following:



Loughney (editor)           August 12, 2004                   [Page 13]





Internet-Draft


      The security features of IPv6 are described in the Security
      Architecture for the Internet Protocol [RFC-2401].
