1.  Introduction

   A number of new technologies, such as 5G, NFV and SDN are not only
   evolving the network from a pure technological perspective but also
   are changing the concept in which new services are offered to the
   customers [I-D.homma-slice-provision-models] by introducing the
   concept of network slicing.

   The transport network is an essential component in the end-to-end
   delivery of services and, consequently, it is necessary to understand
   what could be the way in which the transport network is consumed as a
   slice.  For a definition of IETF network slice refer to
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition].

   In this document it is assumed that there exists a (logically)
   centralized component in the transport network, namely IETF Network
   Slice Controller (NSC) with the responsibilities on the control and
   management of the IETF network slices invoked for a given service, as
   requested by IETF network slice customers.

   This document analyses different use cases deriving the needs of
   potential IETF network slice customers in order to identify the
   functionality required on the North Bound Interface (NBI) of the NSC
   to be exposed towards such IETF network slice customers.  Solutions
   to construct the requested IETF network slices are out of scope of
   this document.

   This document addresses some of the discussions of the TEAS Slice
   Design Team.  However, it is not at this stage an official outcome of
   the Design Team.

2.  Conventions used in this document and terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this draft will be aligned in forthcoming versions
   with the final terminology selected for describing the notion of IETF
   network slice when applied to IETF technologies, which is currently
   under discussion.  By now same terminology as used in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition] and
   [I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework] is primarily used here.

   The term "transport network" in the context of this draft refers in
   broad sense to WAN, MBH, IP backbone and other network segments
   implemented by IETF technologies.

3.  Northbound Interface for IETF Network Slices

   In a general manner, the transport network supports different kinds
   of services.  These services consume capabilities provided by the
   transport network for deploying end-to-end services, interconnecting
   network functions or applications spread across the network and
   providing connectivity toward the final users of these services.

   Under the slicing approach, a IETF network slice customer requests to
   a IETF network slice controller a slice with certain characteristics
   and parametrization.  Such request it is assumed here to be done
   through a NBI exposed by the NSC to the customer, as reflected in
   Figure 1.

                 Figure 1: IETF network slice NBI concept

   The functionality supported by the NBI depends on the requirements
   that the slice customer has to satisfy.  It is then important to
   understand the needs of the slice customers as well as the way of
   expressing them.

4.  IETF Network Slice Use Cases

   Different use cases for slice customers can be identified, as
   described in the following sections.

4.1.  5G Services

   5G services natively rely on the concept of network slicing. 5G is
   expected to allow vertical customers to request slices in such a
   manner that the allocated resources and capabilities in the network
   appear as dedicated for them.

   In network slicing scenarios, a vertical customer requests a network
   operator to allocate a network slice instance (NSI) satisfying a
   particular set of service requirements.  The content/format of these
   requirements are highly dependent on the networking expertise and use
   cases of the customer under consideration.  To deal with this
   heterogeneity, it is fundamental for the network operator to define a
   a unified ability to interpret service requirements from different
   vertical customers, and to represent them in a common language, with
   the purposes of facilitating their translation/mapping into specific
   slicing-aware network configuration actions.  In this regard, model-
   based network slice descriptors built on the principles of
   reproducibility, reusability and customizability can be defined for
   this end.

   As a starting point for such a definition, GSMA developed the idea of
   having a universal blueprint that, being offered by network
   operators, can be used by any vertical customer to order the
   deployment of an NSI based on a specific set of service requirements.
   The result of this work has been the definition of a baseline network
   slice descriptor called Generic network Slice Template (GST).  The
   GST contains multiple attributes that can be used to characterize a
   network slice.  A Network Slice Type (NEST) describes the
   characteristics of a network slice by means of filling GST attributes
   with values based on specific service requirements.  Basically, a
   NEST is a filled-in version of a GST.  Different NESTs allow
   describing different types of network slices.  For slices based on
   standardized service types, e.g. eMBB, uRLLC and mIoT, the network
   operator may have a set of readymade, standardized NESTs (S-NESTs).
   For slices based on specific industry use cases, the network operator
   can define additional NESTs.

   Service requirements from a given vertical customer are mapped to a
   NEST, which provides a self-contained description of the network
   slice to be provisioned for that vertical customer.  According to
   this reasoning, the NEST can be used by the network operator as input
   to the NSI preparation phase, which is defined in [TS28.530]. 3GPP is

   working on the translation of the GST/NEST attributes into NSI
   related requirements, which are defined in the "ServiceProfile" data
   type from the Network Slice Information Object Class (IOC) in
   [TS28.541].  These requirements are used by the 3GPP Management
   System to allocate the NSI across all network domains, including
   transport network.  The IETF network slice defines the part of that
   NSI that is deployed across the transport network.

   Despite the translation is an on-going work in 3GPP it seems
   convenient to start looking at the GST attributes to understand what
   kind of parameters could be required for the IETF network slice NBI.

4.1.1.  3GPP network slice

   A 3GPP network slice represents a logical network that provides
   specific capabilities and network characteristics, supporting the
   service requirements of one or more network slice customers.  The
   service requirements of each network slice customer are captured into
   a separate "ServiceProfile" artifact within the network slice class
   (see Network Slicing NRM fragment in TS 28.541).

   A 3GPP network slice spans from 5GNR access nodes to the UPF that
   terminates the PDU session, i.e. PSA UPF.  In this in-slice data
   path, there are TN segments (e.g. backhaul) that are out of scope of
   3GPP management domain.  For the provisioning and operation of these
   TN segments, usually referred to as transport Network Slice Subnets
   (TN-NSS), the 3GPP management system relies on an external TN
   management system, which hosts (among other components) the IETF NSC.
   To proceed with this delegation, the 3GPP management system needs to
   make available to the TN management system the information described
   in the following sub-sections.

4.1.1.1.  Topology of the TN-NSS

   The TN management system needs to know the transport termination/end
   points to determine the transport resources, either physical or
   virtual nodes.  3GPP management system systems need to provide the
   transport endpoints of 3GPP managed functions that are part of the
   RAN-NSS (e.g., gNB-CU-UP, gNB-CU-CP) and CN-NSS (e.g., UPF, AMF), and
   if applicable further information such as the next-hop router IP
   address configured in a RAN-NSS or CN-NSS.  The TN management system
   should be able to correlate this with the transport network topology
   and derive the site or border routers connecting to 3GPP managed
   functions.

Internet-Draft       IETF NSC NBI based on use cases           July 2021


4.1.1.2.  Traffic segregation and mapping to S-NSSAI list

   As network functions can be shared by many network slices, it will be
   necessary to segregate the traffic belonging to specific slices on
   transport interfaces.

   One option for traffic segregation is to assign application endpoints
   to specific sets of S-NSSAI values.  The transport network can map
   packets to connectivity services based on local remote or remote
   endpoints, provided that the allocation of S-NSSAI to endpoints is
   known and exposed, and provided that the application endpoints are
   visible on the transport layer.  The application endpoints visible in
   a RAN-NSS and CN-NSS are already mapped to a specific set of S-NSSAI.
   Figure 2 illustrates an example of this solution, whereby a 3GPP
   network slice with S-NSSAI=1 is mapped to specific application
   endpoints (e.g., N3 tunnel endpoint 1) by the access network node.
   In this example, the TN management system decides to map application
   endpoints 1 and 2 to the same transport connectivity service A.  This
   mapping is implemented by the site router connecting to the access
   network node.  On the core network slice, a similar mapping is done
   by the border router.  Demultiplexing the packet streams belonging to
   different transport interfaces is based on regular routing and
   reachability of endpoint IP addresses.

      Figure 2: Mapping of S-NSSAI to specific application endpoints

   Despite the simplicity of the above-referred approach, notice that it
   is not a universal solution as the application endpoint addresses are
   not always visible to the TN, for example when they are encrypted by
   IPSec tunnels.  In such a case, the application endpoints are not
   visible to the site router, and thus cannot be used for transport
   connectivity mappings.  To deal with these situations, an alternative
   solution is to use the concept of logical transport interfaces.  A
   logical transport interface is a virtual interface separate from
   application endpoints; it can be for example a specific IP address /
   VLAN combination that corresponds to an IPSec termination point, an
   identifier (e.g., MPLS label, segment ID) that the TN recognizes, or
   it can be just a logical interface defined on top of top a physical
   transport interface.  As long as the interface identity can derived
   from packet headers, the TN nodes can perform the mapping to
   transport connectivity services.  In this regard, it is useful to
   indicate to the TN which traffic types are carried over an interface
   (e.g., N3 user plane packets, N2 control plane packets, etc.).

   Figure 3 illustrates an example on the use of this solution.  As
   seen, logical transport need to be exposed from 3GPP management
   system to TN management system, so that the latter can create
   transport network topology and determine the TN resources to support
   the 3GPP slice.

                  Figure 3: Logical Transport Interfaces

   For traffic segregation, though solutions might be valid, 3GPP
   prefers the second solution: on the use of concept of transport
   logical interface.  The reason is that it does not impose 1:1 mapping
   between application endpoint and transport interface (allowing for
   better redundancy) and that it always works, no matter if encryption.
   To support this solution, the 3GPP has recently extended the Network
   Slice NRM fragment, including a new Information Object Class called
   EP_Transport.  This class provides a complete characterization of the
   logical transport interface, including transport level information
   (i.e., IP address, reachability information, QoS profile) and the set



Contreras, et al.       Expires January 13, 2022                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       IETF NSC NBI based on use cases           July 2021


   of application endpoints aggregated to this interface.  For further
   information on reachability information and QoS profile, see next
   subsections.  For further details on fields of EP_Transport, see
   Network Slice NRM fragment in TS 28.541.

4.1.1.3.  Reachability information

   Each physical or logical transport interface will carry the traffic
   associated with some 3GPP application endpoints that may be using IP
   addresses separate from the transport interface.  These IP addresses
   must be reachable within the TN-NSS, and hence they need to be
   advertised to populate forwarding tables.  A 3GPP network function
   can advertise such reachability information by running a dynamic
   routing protocol towards the next hop router.  If that is not
   possible, it can create association between the reachability data
   with the logical transport interface and expose it towards the 3GPP
   and TN management system.  This information can be derived from the
   IP addresses available for application and transport endpoints.

4.1.1.4.  QoS profiling

   Each TN-NSS may be associated a "TNSliceSubnetProfile", which hosts
   the SLO requirements (e.g., guaranteed throughput, bounded latency,
   maximum jitter) that the TN-NSS must support.  "TNSliceSubnetProfile"
   is a 3GPP artifact that result from the decomposition of e2e service
   requirements ("ServiceProfile" artifact ) into domain-specific
   service requirements ("RANSliceSubnetProfile", "CNSliceSubnetProfile"
   and "TNSliceSubnetProfile") applicable to RAN-NSS, CN-NSS and TN-NSS
   respectively.  Unlike "RANSliceSubnetProfile" and
   "CNSliceSubnetProfile", there is not agreement yet on the specific
   parameters to be captured by the "TNSliceSubnetProfile".  Further
   work in this regard in the upcoming 3GPP SA5 meetings.

   Upon receiving the "TNSliceSubnetProfile" from the 3GPP management
   system, the TN management system translates the SLO requirements
   therein into a QoS profile, which includes applicability and use of
   DSCPs and other QoS related properties onto the TN-NSS realization.
   To enable this, each logical interface may have an associated QoS
   profile.  The QoS profile is just a reference to the detailed profile
   parameters which are logically provisioned on both sides of a logical
   transport interface.

4.1.2.  Generic network Slice Template

   The structure of the GST is defined in [GSMA].  The template defines
   a total of 35 attributes.  For each of them, the following
   information is provided:




Contreras, et al.       Expires January 13, 2022               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft       IETF NSC NBI based on use cases           July 2021


   o  Attribute definition, which provides a formal definition of what
      the attribute represents.

   o  Attribute parameters, including:

      *  Value, e.g. integer, float.

      *  Measurement unit, e.g. milliseconds, Gbps

      *  Example, which provides examples of values the parameter can
         take in different use cases.

      *  Tag, which allow describing the type of parameter, according to
         its semantics.  An attribute can be tagged as a
         characterization attribute or a scalability attribute.  If it
         is characterization attribute, it can be further tagged as a
         performance-related attribute, a functionality-related
         attribute or an operation-related attribute.

      *  Exposure, which allow describing how this attribute interact
         with the slice customer, either as an API or a KPI.

   o  Attribute presence, either mandatory, conditional or optional.

   Attributes from GST can be used by the network operator (slice
   controller) and a vertical customer (slice customer) to agree SLA.

   GST attributes are generic in the sense that they can be used to
   characterize different types of network slices.  Once those
   attributes become filled with specific values, it becomes a NEST
   which can be ordered by slice customers.

4.1.3.  Categorization of GST attributes

   Not all the GST attributes as defined in [GSMA] have impact in the
   transport network since some of them are specific to either the radio
   or the mobile core part.

   In the analysis performed in this document, the attributes have been
   categorized as:

   o  Directly impactive attributes, which are those that have direct
      impact on the definition of the IETF network slice, i.e.,
      attributes that can be directly translated into requirements
      required to be satisfied by a IETF network slice.

   o  Indirectly impactive attributes, which are those that impact in an
      indirect manner on the definition of the IETF network slice, i.e.,



Contreras, et al.       Expires January 13, 2022               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft       IETF NSC NBI based on use cases           July 2021


      attributes that indirectly impose some requirements to a IETF
      network slice.

   o  Non-impactive attributes, that are those which do not have impact
      on the IETF network slice at all.

   The following sections describe the attributes falling into the three
   categories.

4.1.3.1.  Attributes with direct impact on the IETF network slice
          definition

   The following attributes impose requirements in the IETF network
   slice

   o  Availability

   o  Deterministic communication

   o  Downlink throughput per network slice

   o  Energy efficiency

   o  Group communication support

   o  Isolation level

   o  Maximum supported packet size

   o  Mission critical support

   o  Performance monitoring

   o  Slice quality of service parameters

   o  Support for non-IP traffic

   o  Uplink throughput per network slice

   o  User data access (i.e., tunneling mechanisms)

4.1.3.2.  Attributes with indirect impact on the IETF network slice
          definition

   The following attributes indirectly impose requirements in the IETF
   network slice to support the end-to-end service.





Contreras, et al.       Expires January 13, 2022               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft       IETF NSC NBI based on use cases           July 2021


   o  Area of service (i.e., the area where terminals can access a
      particular network slice)

   o  Delay tolerance (i.e., if the service can be delivered when the
      system has sufficient resources)

   o  Downlink (maximum) throughput per UE

   o  Network functions owned by Network Slice Customer

   o  Maximum number of (concurrent) PDU sessions

   o  Performance prediction (i.e., capability to predict the network
      and service status)

   o  Root cause investigation

   o  Session and Service Continuity support

   o  Simultaneous use of the network slice

   o  Supported device velocity

   o  UE density

   o  Uplink (maximum) throughput per UE

   o  User management openness (i.e., capability to manage users'
      network services and corresponding requirements)

   o  Latency from (last) UPF to Application Server

4.1.3.3.  Attributes with no impact on the IETF network slice definition

   The following attributes do not impact the IETF network slice.

   o  Location based message delivery (not related to the geographical
      spread of the network slice itself but with the localized
      distribution of information)

   o  MMTel support, i.e. support of and Multimedia Telephony Service
      (MMTel)as well as IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) support.

   o  NB-IoT Support, i.e., support of NB-IoT in the RAN in the network
      slice.

   o  Maximum number of (simultaneous) UEs

   o  Positioning support

   o  Radio spectrum

   o  Synchronicity (among devices)

   o  V2X communication mode

   o  Network Slice Specific Authentication and Authorization (NSSAA)

4.1.4.  Provisioning procedures

   3GPP identifies in [TS28.541] a number of procedures for the
   provisioning of a network slice in general.  It can be assumed that
   similar procedures may also apply to a transport slice, facilitating
   a consistent management and control of end-to-end slices.

   The envisioned procedures are the following:

   o  Slice instance allocation: this procedure permits to create a new
      slice instance (or reuse an existing one).

   o  Slice instance de-allocation: this procedure decommissions a
      previously instantiated slice.

   o  Slice instance modification: this procedure permits the change in
      the characteristics of an existing slice instance.

   o  Get slice instance status: this procedure helps to retrieve run-
      time information on the status of a deployed slice instance.

   o  Retrieval of slice capabilities: this procedure assists on getting
      information about the capabilities (e.g. maximum latency
      supported).

   All these procedures fit in the operation of transport network
   slices.

4.2.  NFV-based services

   NFV technology allows the flexible and dynamic instantiation of
   virtualized network functions (and their composition into network
   services) on top of a distributed, cloud-enabled compute
   infrastructure.  This infrastructure can span across different points
   of presence in a carrier network.  By leveraging on transport network
   slicing, connectivity services established across geographically
   remote points of presence can be enriched by providing additional QoS




Contreras, et al.       Expires January 13, 2022               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft       IETF NSC NBI based on use cases           July 2021


   guarantees with respect present state-of-the-art mechanisms, as
   conventional L2/L3 VPNs.

4.2.1.  Connectivity attributes

   The connectivity services are expressed through a number of
   attributes as listed:

   o  Incoming and outgoing bandwidth: bandwidth required for the
      connectivity services (in Mbps).

   o  Qos metrics: set of metrics (e.g., cost, latency and delay
      variation) applicable to a specific connectivity service

   o  Directionality: indication if the traffic is unidirectional or
      bidirectional.

   o  MTU: value of the largest PDU to be transmitted in the
      connectivity service.

   o  Protection scheme: indication of the kind of protection to be
      performed (e.g., 1;1, 1+1, etc.)

   o  Connectivity mode: indication of the service is point-to-point of
      point-to-multipoint

   All those attributes will assist on the characterization of the
   connectivity slice to be deployed, and thus, are relevant for the
   definition of a IETF network slice supporting such connectivity.

4.2.2.  Provisioning procedures

   ETSI NFV defines the role of WAN Infrastructure Manager (WIM) as the
   component in charge of managing and controlling the connectivity
   external to the PoPs.  In [IFA032] a number of interfaces are
   identified to be exposed by the WIM for supporting the multi-site
   connectivity, thus representing the capabilities expected for a
   transport network slice, as well, in case of satisfying such
   connectivity needs by means of the slice concept.

   The interfaces considered are the following:

   o  Multi-Site Connectivity Service (MSCS) Management: this interface
      permits the creation, termination, update and query of MSCSs,
      including reservation.  It also enables subscription for
      notifications and information retrieval associated to the
      connectivity service.




Contreras, et al.       Expires January 13, 2022               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft       IETF NSC NBI based on use cases           July 2021


   o  Capacity Management: this interface allows querying about the
      capacity (e.g. bandwidth), topology, and network edge points of
      the connectivity service, as well as about information of consumed
      and available capacity on the underlying network resources.

   o  Fault Management: this interface serves for the provision of
      alarms related to the MSCSs.

   o  Performance Management: this interface assists on the retrieval of
      performance information (measurement results collection and
      notifications) related to MSCSs.

4.3.  Network sharing

   Network sharing is one of the means network operators exploit for
   increasing efficiencies.  There are different scenarios of network
   sharing, being especially popular in the deployment of mobile
   networks, typically referred to as Radio Access Network (RAN)
   sharing.  From an operational perspective, in RAN sharing we have two
   roles: master operator, being the actor (e.g. infrastructure
   provider, network operator) to which the deployment and daily
   operation of shared RAN elements are entrusted to; and the
   participant operators, who are the mobile operators who share the RAN
   facilities provided by the master operator.  Note that in this
   context the master and participant operator can be seen as provider
   and customer, respectively.

   While there exist different modes of RAN sharing [TS23.251],
   including passive RAN sharing (infrastructure site sharing) and
   active RAN sharing (e.g.  Multi-Operator Core Networks or MOCN), most
   of the cases require the establishment of separated connections in
   order to separate the traffic per participant operator.  Such
   connections typically extend from the cell site to some pre-defined
   and agreed interconnection points, from which the traffic is routed
   and delivered to individual participant operators.

   The above-referred connections can have specific attributes.  Aspects
   like guaranteed bandwidth (in line with the expected load from the
   aggregated cells), redundancy, bounded latency (per kind of traffic),
   or secure delivery of the information should be considered.

   The master operator is the one in charge of provisioning the
   connections and collecting management data (e.g. performance
   measurements, telemetry, fault alarms, trace data) for individual
   participant operators.  The use of network slicing could make the
   network sharing approach more flexible by allowing the other
   operators control and manage the established connections [MEF].

Internet-Draft       IETF NSC NBI based on use cases           July 2021


   The implications of the RAN sharing scenario here described can be
   extended to either fixed networks or even to mobile networks
   leveraging on radio functional split (i.e., including fronthaul and
   midhaul network segments).

4.3.1.  Connectivity attributes

   The connections for RAN sharing typically consider attributes like:

   o  Maximum and Guaranteed Bit Rate (MBR and GBR respectively).

   o  Bounded latency (e.g., for user plane, control plane, etc)

   o  Packet loss rate.

   o  IP addressing (consistent among the operators sharing the
      infrastructure).

   o  L2/L3 reachability.

   o  Recovery time (on the event of failures).

   o  Secure connection (e.g., encryption support).

4.3.2.  Provisioning procedures

   The expected provisioning procedures are:

   o  Connection provisioning between site and interconnection point.
      Those connections could evolve in time in terms of capacity
      depending on the capacity growth of each particular site.

   o  Collection of management data, including performance measurements,
      fault alarms and trace data.

4.4.  SD-WAN

   SD-WAN is a solution to provide a virtual overlay network for
   connecting between customer's sites, (virtual) private cloud, or
   public cloud/Internet.  SD-WAN operates over one or more underlay
   networks, and enables to offer more differentiated service delivery
   capabilities.  SD-WAN can be esteemed as a type of network slices or
   can be established over underlay networks provided as network slices.
   The definitions, specification, service attributes, and framework of
   SD-WAN is defined in Metro Ethernet Forum ([MEF-70]).

   SD-WAN forwards traffic based on application flows, and the policies
   include rules and constraints on the forwarding of the application

   flows.  In SD-WAN, it may be required from the customer to adjust the
   behaviors based on its needs in near real time.  The service provider
   is required to monitor the performance of the service and modify the
   forwarding policies based on the real-time telemetry from the
   underlying network components.

4.4.1.  SD-WAN Structure

   SD-WAN has three logical constructs:

   o  SD-WAN virtual connection

   o  SD-WAN virtual connection endpoint

   o  SD-WAN UNI

   Several additional components may be visible to the customer.  These
   include:

   o  Customer network

   o  Service provider network

   o  Underlay connectivity

   o  Tunnel virtual connection

   The following figure shows the overview of SD-WAN structure.  In this
   case, the customer sites are connected with underlay connectivity#1
   and they are also connected to remote private cloud with underlay
   connectivity#2.  An SD-WAN endpoint is usually located in each
   customer network site as a CPE or a customer edge, and it allocates
   application flow to appropriate underlay connectivity.

   SD-WAN may be provided as a network slice, or it is realized on
   several network slices provided as underlay connectivities.  In the
   former case, a network slice PE will be mapped to CE in SD-WAN.  In
   the later case, PEs of the provider of underlay connectivities will
   behave as network slice PEs.

4.4.2.  Connectivity Attributes

   SD-WAN defined in MEF-70 has several attributes on its connectivity
   as below:

   o  SD-WAN Identifier:  the value is a string that is used by the
      customer and service provider to uniquely identify an SD-WAN
      connectivity.

   o  Endpoint list:  the value is a list contains endpoint identifiers
      and their connected endpoints.

   o  Service Uptime Objective:  the value is the proportion of time

   o  Reserved Prefixes:  the values are IP prefixes reserved by the
      service provider for use for SD-WAN within its own network or for
      distribution to the customer via DHCP or SLAAC.

   o  List for Policies:  the value is a list of policies applied to
      application flows and application flow groups at endpoints.  An
      SD-WAN policy list contains policy name and list of policy
      criteria.  Support of the criteria listed below would be required:

      * Encryption:  indicates whether or not the application flow
         requires encryption

      *  Public-Private:  indicates whether the application flow can
         traverse public or private underlay connectivity services (or
         both).

      *  Internet-Breakout:  indicates whether the application flow
         should be forwarded to an Internet destination.

      *  Billing-Method:  indicate the application flow can be sent over
         an underlay connectivity service that has usage-based or flat-
         rate billing.

      *  Backup:  indicates whether this application flow can use a TVC
         designated as aEUR&#157;backupaEUR&#157;.

      *  Bandwidth:  specifies a rate limit on the application flow.

   o  List of Application Flow Groups:  the value is a list of
      application flow groups that application flows can be members of.
      An application flow group list contains application flow group
      name and application flow group policy.

   o  List of Application Flows:  the value is a list of the application
      flows that are recognized by the SD-WAN.  An application flow list
      contains application flow name, list of application flow criteria,
      and application flow group name.  The criteria is listed below:

      *  Ethertype

      *  C-VLAN ID list

      *  IPv4 source address

      *  IPv4 destination address

      *  IPv4 source or destination address

4.4.3.  SD-WAN Endpoint Attributes

   SD-WAN contains some endpoints as boundary nodes between underlay
   connections and customers sites.  [MEF-70] defines some attributes
   for SD-WAN endpoints as below:

   o  Endpoint Identifier:  the value is for identification of SD-WAN
      endpoint for management purposes.

   o  Endpoint UNI:  the value is for identification of the UNI that the
      endpoint is associated with.

   o  Endpoint policy map:  the value is for mapping policies to
      application flows and application flow groups.

4.4.4.  SD-WAN UNI Attributes

   SD-WAN UNI is a reference point that represents the demarcation
   between the responsibility of the customer and the responsibility of
   the provider.  Some attributes for UNI is defined in [MEF-70] as
   below:

   o  SD-WAN UNI Identifier:  the value is for identification of the UNI
      for management purposes.

   o  SD-WAN UNI L2 Interface:  the value describes the underlay L2
      interface for the UNI.

   o  SD-WAN UNI Maximum L2 Frame Size:  the value specifies the maximum
      length L2 frame that is accepted by the provider.

   o  SD-WAN UNI IPv4 connection addressing:  the value describes IPv4
      connection address mechanisms (e.g., Static or DHCP).

   o  SD-WAN UNI IPv6 connection addressing:  the value describes IPv6
      connection address mechanisms (e.g., DHCP, SLAAC, Static or Link-
      Local-only).

4.5.  Radio functional splits

   The disaggregation of the software stack in radio base stations
   allows the centralization of some of the radio processing functions.
   O-RAN is promoting the interoperability of implementations of radio
   functional splits, defining an architecture where three main entities
   can be considered: the Radio Unit (RU), with some basic processing,
   the Distributed Unit (DU) with the rest of real-time processing
   capabilities, and the Centralized Unit (CU) with the non-real-time
   processing of the software stack.  The network segment between RU and
   DU is known as fronthaul (FH), while the segment between DU and CU is
   referred as midhaul (MH).  Figure 5 shows this situation.

               .................................................
               :  Radio functional split                       :
 +-------+     :                                               :

 +-------+     :                                               :
               :                                               :
               :...............................................:

                  Figure 5: Logical Transport Interfaces

   The fronthaul leverages on eCPRI protocol which can be transported
   directly on Ethernet frames or encapsulated in IP/UDP (for the user
   plane).  The midhaul can be transported in a similar way as the
   backhaul.

   With current specifications, individual service flows being carried
   by FH cannot be distinguished, so no possibility of differentiating
   connectivity slices at that point.  Similar thing happens for MH.
   The only possible differentiation per flow can happen in downstream
   direction from CU to DU, but this basically can only help for
   policing traffic at that point (i.e., slice is yet the same).

   Advanced scenarios such as RU sharing could allow traffic
   differentiation per mobile operator based on e.g. vlans, being each
   of those vlans mapped to a different slice.

4.5.1.  Attributes and procedures

   The attributes of IETF network slices for the conveniently supported
   the radio functional split are based on main characteristics of FH/
   MH: Latency, BW, and packet loss, as specified in [O-RAN].
   Geographical location could have an impact due to latency
   restrictions for FH.

   Regarding slice management procedures, it can be assumed a similar
   lifecycle as in 3GPP slices.
