Internet-Draft              SSRC Multiplexing                  july 2010


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4588] documents two methods to multiplex RTP sessions: Session-
   multiplexing and SSRC-multiplexing.
   [I-D.ietf-avt-ports-for-ucast-mcast-rtp] and
   [I-D.ietf-avt-ports-for-ucast-mcast-rtp] currently specify the use of
   the first method: sessions multiplexing.  This document specifies the
   second method: SSRC multiplexing method.  The main motivation being
   the acceleration of real time services like fast retransmission (RET)
   and rapid multicast source acquisition (RAMS) in presence of NAT.

   Section 1 develops the motivation.  Section 2 specifies the SSRC
   multiplexing for RET and RAMS.  Section 3 discusses the solution.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   The following terms are given to avoid misunderstanding between
   [I-D.ietf-avt-ports-for-ucast-mcast-rtp], [RFC4588] and [RFC5760]
   Terminology.

   session-multiplexing: [RFC4588]specifies Session-multiplexing as a
   scheme by which the original stream and the associated retransmission
   stream are sent into two different RTP sessions.

   SSRC-multiplexing: [RFC4588]specifies SSRC-multiplexing as a scheme
   by which the original stream and the retransmission stream are sent
   in the same RTP session with different SSRC values.

   source1: The initial source (e.g. multicast source) of content is
   named 'source1' in this document. source1 is sometime named 'Media
   sender'.

   source2: The additional source (e.g.  RAMS and RET server) of content
   to multiplex with the initial source is named 'source2' in this
   document.  Source2 is sometime named 'Distribution Source'.

   Retransmission (RET): [RFC4588] specifies Retransmission request as a
   means by which an RTP receiver is able to request the retransmission
   of the original packet.  Usually, an RTCP FB NACK packet as specified
   in[RFC4588]is used as retransmission request for lost packets.

   Rapid multicast source acquisition (RAMS):

   [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp]specifies the RTCP FB RAMS
   request based on [RFC4588] is used to request for the burst of
   packets of the new channel.


3.  Motivation

   The delay to switch from one TV channel to another is much longer on
   IP multicast than on broadcast network because on IP networks the
   receiver does not receive all the channels simultaneously.  The loss
   of IP packets multicasted over IP networks decreases the quality of
   the video received because it introduces blockyness.

   RAMS [draft-ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp-10] defines a method
   that reduces the acquisition delay when a receiver switch among
   different multicast session, such as video broadcasts.  RET [RFC4588]
   defines an RTP retransmission method that repairs packet losses
   between an RTP sender and a receiver.

   SSRC multiplexing is part of this effort.  The motivation for this
   draft is to specify a method that reduces the number of packets
   exchanged and the processing time to improve and guarantee RAMS and
   RET performance.

   Briefly saying, SSRC multiplexing is based on the sharing of the same
   transport parameters by a request/response procedure like RET or
   RAMS, each direction having its own SSRC identifier: The RTCP request
   initiates the NAT binding for downloading the RTP content.  As the 2
   directions share the NAT binding there is not port mapping need.

   Per design RET and RAMS must improve the QoE of the multicast video
   session considered.  The usage of RET must reduce the blockyness.
   The usage of RAMS must reduce the zapping duration.  Both rely on the
   ability of the server 'source2' to send the data requested in real
   time over RTP.  Delaying the response must be avoided because it
   reduces the improvement of the QoE intrinsically expected.
   Additional processing must be avoided because it introduces non
   deterministic delay which may jeopardize the initial objective.

   SSRC-multiplexing reduces the processing duration in the server and
   in the terminal.  It reduces the processing in the server.  It
   reduces the processing and simplifies the logic in the terminal: the
   response arrives naturally on the port which sent the request.
   Furthermore, the real time request/response approach of the SSRC-
   multiplexing guarantees the aliveness of the NAT binding.

4.  SSRC multiplexing

   This section specifies SSRC-multiplexing for RET and RAMS.  According
   to [RFC4588], when ssrc-multiplexed is selected, each RTP session has
   its own SSRC, so that RTCP messages can distinguish them whatever RTP
   sessions are multicast or unicast.

4.1.   SSRC-multiplexing for RET

   This section specifies SSRC-multiplexing for RET.

   In the figure below SSRC multiplexing occurs because the new RTP
   session created by source2 to send the missing packets shares the
   transport parameters (addresses, port) of the session which requests
   the packets retransmission.  Consequently the streams corresponding
   to the 2 SSRCs share the natural NAT binding.  The RTCP upstream
   opens the NAT for the RTP download stream.

   Figure 1: SSRC-multiplexing for RET

   Step 1: source1 sends RTP packets with SSRC_ChA that identifies the
   video session.  Source2 receives the packets.  Receiver detects
   several lost of packets.

   Step 2: The receiver requests a fast retransmission (RET) of the
   packets not received, it sends a RTCP FB NACK message in a session
   identified by a SSRC chosen by itself.  This message identifies the
   packets of channel A requested.

   Step 3: source2 sends the retransmission packet with the same ports
   and IP addresses than the RTCP FB message received.  The flow of
   retransmitted packet is identified by a new SSRC SSRC_C.

4.2.   SSRC-multiplexing for RAMS

   This section specifies SSRC-multiplexing for RAMS.

   In the figure below SSRC multiplexing occurs because the new RTP
   session created by source2 to send the burst of channel B content
   reuses the transport parameters (addresses, port) of the RTCP
   request: SSRC_B and SSRC_C are multiplexed over the same transport
   session.

   Figure 2: SSRC-multiplexing for RAMS

   Step 1: Source1 sends RTP packets of Channel A in a session
   identified with SSRC_ChA.

   Step 2: when the user switches to channel B, its terminal sends a
   RTCP RAMS request in a session identified by a SSRC choosen locally,
   SSRC_B. The RAMS request includes the identifier of the new channel
   selected, the SSRC of Channel_B.

   Step 3: source2 sends the retransmission packet with the same ports
   and IP addresses than the RTCP RAMS request received.  The flow of
   retransmited packet is identified by a new SSRC SSRC_C choosen
   locally by source2.

   After receiving the RAMS content the terminal switches to the regular
   source of Channel B content, source1.

5.  Discussion

   Keep Alive:

   The adding of extra signaling and processing does not benefit of NAT
   binding naturally created by the request .  One consequence is the
   need of additional messages to maintain the session open on the NAT.
   In other term the bootstrap of the session may be so long that the
   NAT has closed the session before the RET or the RAMS traffic is sent
   by the server source2.

   Performance:

   RET and RAMS were introduced to improve the QoE of multicast video
   sessions.  RET is designed to reduce the blockyness.  RAMS is
   designed to reduce the zapping duration.  Both rely on the ability of
   the server 'source2' to send the data requested in real time over
   RTP.  The adding of extra signaling and processing delays the
   response and consequently reduces the improvement of the QoE
   intrisically expected.  SSRC-multiplexing reduces the processing
   duration in the server and in the terminal.  It reduces the
   processing in the server.  It reduces the processing and simplifies
   the logic in the terminal: the response arrives naturally on the port
   which sent the request without additional processing.

   Scalability:

   The adding of extra signaling and processing like Keeplive and NAT
   binding management adds non deterministic processing duration and
   resource comsumption in the server source2.  This prevent any
   optimization of the deployment of RET and RAMS services.

   NAT binding management:

   NAT binding maps the local transport parameters on the public
   transport parameters.  It must be performed for each service request
   to capture any change of local transport parameters.  The adding of
   extra signaling and processing during the binding must be avoided at
   this step to keep the delay of response as low as possible.
