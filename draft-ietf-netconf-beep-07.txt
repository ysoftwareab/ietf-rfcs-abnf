Internet-Draft              NETCONF over BEEP             September 2005


1.  Introduction

   The NETCONF protocol [1] defines a simple mechanism through which a
   network device can be managed.  NETCONF is designed to be usable over
   a variety of application protocols.  This document specifies an
   application protocol mapping for NETCONF over the Blocks Extensible
   Exchange Protocol (BEEP) [7] .

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

1.1  Why BEEP?

   Use of BEEP is natural as an application protocol for transport of
   XML.  As a peer to peer protocol, BEEP provides an easy way to
   implement NETCONF, no matter which side of the connection was the
   initiator.  This "bidirectionality" allows for either manager or
   agent to initiate a connection.  This is particularly important to
   support large number of intermittently connected devices, as well as
   those devices that must reverse the management connection in the face
   of firewalls and network address translators (NATs).

   BEEP makes use of the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)
   [3].  The SASL profile used by BEEP allows for a simple and direct
   mapping to the existing security model for CLI, while transportlayer
   security (TLS) [4] provides a strong well tested encryption mechanism
   with either server or server and client-side authentication.

Internet-Draft              NETCONF over BEEP             September 2005


2.  BEEP Transport Mapping

   All NETCONF over BEEP implementations MUST implement the profile and
   functional mapping between NETCONF and BEEP as described below.

2.1  NETCONF Session Establishment

   Managers may be either BEEP listeners or initiators.  Similarly,
   agents may be either listeners or initiators.  Thus the initial
   exchange takes place without regard to whether a manager or the agent
   is the initiator.  After the transport connection is established, as
   greetings are exchanged, they SHOULD each announce their support for
   TLS and optionally SASL.  Once greetings are exchanged, if TLS is to
   be used and available by both parties, the listener STARTs a channel
   with the TLS profile.

   Once TLS has been started, a new greeting is sent by both initiator
   and listener, as required by the BEEP RFC.

   At this point, if SASL is desired, the initiator starts a BEEP
   channel to perform a SASL exchange to authenticate itself.  Upon
   completion of authentication the channel is closed.  That is, the
   channel is exclusively used to authenticate.

   Examples of both TLS and SASL profiles can be found in [7].

   It is anticipated that the SASL PLAIN mechanism will be heavily used
   in conjunction with TLS.[5]  In such cases, in accordance with RFC
   2595 the PLAIN mechanism MUST NOT be advertised in the first BEEP
   <greeting>, but only in the one following a successful TLS
   negotiation.  This applies only if TLS and SASL PLAIN mechanisms are
   both to be used.  The SASL PLAIN mechanism MUST NOT be used
   unencrypted channels to avoid risk of eavesdropping.  More specifics
   about the use of SASL and TLS are mentioned in Security
   Considerations below.

   Once authentication has occurred, there is no need to distinguish
   between initiator and listener.  We now distinguish between manager
   and agent, and it is assumed that each knows its role in the
   conversation.

2.2  Starting a Channel for NETCONF

   The manager now establishes new channel and specifies the single
   NETCONF profile.  For example:

Internet-Draft              NETCONF over BEEP             September 2005


         (M = Manager ; A = Agent )

         M: MSG 0 1 . 10 48 101
         M: Content-type: application/beep+xml
         M: <start number="1">
         M:   <profile uri="http://iana.org/beep/netconf" />
         M: </start>
         M: END
         A: RPY 0 1 . 38 87
         A: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
         A:
         A: <profile uri="http://iana.org/beep/netconf" />
         A: END

   At this point we are ready to proceed on BEEP channel 1 with NETCONF
   operations.

   Next the manager and the agent exchange NETCONF <hello> elements on
   the new channel so that each side learns the other's capabilities.
   This occurs through a MSG.  Each side will then respond with
   positively.  The following example is adapted from [1] Section 8.1:


       A: MSG 1 0 . 0 442
       A: Content-type: application/beep+xml
       A:
       A: <hello xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
       A:   <capabilities>
       A:     <capability>
       A:       urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0
       A:     </capability>
       A:     <capability>
       A:       urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:capability:startup:1.0
       A:     </capability>
       A:     <capability>
       A:       http:/example.net/router/2.3/core#myfeature
       A:     </capability>
       A:   </capabilities>
       A:   <session-id>4</session-id>
       A: </hello>
       A: END

       M: RPY 1 0 . 0 0
       M: END


   Certain NETCONF capabilities may require additional BEEP channels.
   When such capabilities are defined, a BEEP mapping must be defined as

   well.

   At this point, the NETCONF session is established, and capabilities
   have been exchanged.

2.3  NETCONF Session Usage

   Nearly all NETCONF operations are executed through the <rpc> tag.  To
   issue an RPC, the manager transmits on the operational channel a BEEP
   MSG containing the RPC and its arguments.  In accordance with the
   BEEP standard, RPC requests may be split across multiple BEEP frames.

   Once received and processed, the agent responds with BEEP RPY
   messages on the same channel with the response to the RPC.  In
   accordance with the BEEP standard, responses may be split across
   multiple BEEP frames.

2.4  NETCONF Session Teardown

   Upon receipt of <close-session> from the manager, once the agent has
   completed all RPCs, it will close BEEP channel 0.  When an agent
   needs to initiate a close it will do so by closing BEEP channel 0.
   Although not required to do so, the agent should allow for a
   reasonable period for a manager to release an existing lock prior to
   initiating a close.  Once the agent has closed channel 0, all locks
   are released, and each side follows tear down procedures as specified
   in [8].  Having received a BEEP close or having sent <close-session>,
   a manager MUST NOT send further requests.  If there are additional
   activities due to expanded capabilities, these MUST cease in an
   orderly manner, and should be properly described in the capability
   mapping.

2.5  BEEP Profile for NETCONF

   Profile Identification: http://iana.org/beep/netconf

3.  Security Considerations

   Configuration information is by its very nature sensitive.  Its
   transmission in the clear and without integrity checking leaves
   devices open to classic so-called "person in the middle" attacks.
   Configuration information often times contains passwords, user names,
   service descriptions, and topological information, all of which are
   sensitive.  A NETCONF application protocol, therefore, must minimally
   support options for both confidentiality and authentication.

   The BEEP mapping described in this documents addresses both
   confidentiality and authentication in a flexible manner through the
   use of TLS and SASL profiles.  Confidentiality is provided via the
   TLS profile, and is used as discussed above.  In addition, the server
   certificate shall serve as the server's authentication to the client.
   The client MUST be prepared to recognize a valid server certificate.
   While distribution of such certificates is beyond the scope of this
   document, the implementor is cautioned to be aware of any
   interdependencies that may be placed on the network infrastructure
   through the use of protocols that validate trust anchors.

   For client-side authentication there are several options.  The client
   MAY provide a certificate during the initiation phase of TLS, in
   which case the subject of that certificate shall be considered
   principle for authentication purposes.  Once again, server
   implementors should be aware of any interdependencies that could be
   created through protocols used to validate trust anchors.

   In the case where the client has not authenticated through TLS, the
   server SHOULD advertise one or more SASL profile, from which the
   client will choose.  In the singular case where TLS is established
   the minimum profile MAY be PLAIN.  Otherwise, implementations MUST
   support the DIGEST-MD5 profile as described in [6], and they MAY
   support other profiles such as OTP.[10]

   Different environments may well allow different rights prior to and
   then after authentication.  An authorization model is not specified
   in this document.  When an operation is not properly authorized then
   a simple rpc-error containing "permission denied" is sufficient.
   Note that authorization information may be exchanged in the form of
   configuration information, which is all the more reason to ensure the
   security of the connection.
