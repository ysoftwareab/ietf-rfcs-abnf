     IODEF extension for Reporting Cyber-Physical System Incidents
                     draft-murillo-mile-cps-00.txt

Abstract

   This draft document will extend the Incident Object Description
   Exchange Format (IODEF) defined in [RFC5070] to support the reporting
   of incidents dealing with attacks to physical infrastructure through
   the utilization of IT means as a vehicle or as a tool.  These systems
   might also be referred as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Operational
   Technology Systems, Industrial Control Systems, Automatic Control
   Systems, or simply Control Systems.  These names are used
   interchangeably in this document.  In this context, an incident is
   generally the result of a cybersecurity issue whose main goal is to
   affect the operation of a CPS.  It is considered that any
   unauthorized alteration of the operation is always malign.  This
   extension will provide the capability of embedding structured
   information, such as identifier- and XML-based information.  In its
   current state, this document provides important considerations for
   further work in implementing Cyber-Physical System incident reports,
   either by utilizing any already existing industry formats (XML-
   encoded) and/or by utilizing atomic data.

   In addition, this document should provide appropriate material for
   helping making due considerations in making an appropriate decision
   on how a CPS reporting is done: 1) through a data format extension to
   the Incident Object Description Exchange Format [RFC5070], 2) forming
   part of an already existing IODEF-extension for structured
   cybersecurity information (currently draft
   draft-ietf-mile-sci-11.txt), or others.  While the format and
   contents of the present document fit more the earlier option, these
   can also be incorporated to the later.

1.  Introduction

   Cyber-Physical and related systems have taken a key role in all types
   of infrastructures for decades.  These are now at a higher risk to be
   the target of attacks by motivated and highly-skilled attackers,
   these being individuals, groups, or nation-states [ACS].  Among the
   issues that catalyse this higher risk are: i) these systems are
   gradually becoming more interconnected, ii) legacy systems do not
   have proper cybersecurity protection, iii) the existence of highly-
   skilled individuals and motivations, iv) some these systems are
   generally considered critical, v) these are a natural extension of IT
   cyber-attacks, vi) the emergence of the Internet of Things (IOT), and
   vi) these attacks can be carried out remotely and quite
   inexpensively.

   While over 90% of critical control system infrastructure is currently
   owned by private enterprises, these can have direct repercussions on
   national security [SFC].  Indeed, various of these systems are key
   parts of nuclear reactor facilities, missile systems, transportation
   systems, electric power distribution, oil and natural gas
   distribution, water and waste-water treatment, dam infrastructure,
   and others.  They are also at the core of health-care devices and
   transportation management.  The disruption of these control systems
   could have a significant impact on public health, safety, and lead to
   large economic losses.

   Sections Section 2 and Section 3 of this document provide an overview
   of the terminology, architecture, and process of a cyber-physical
   event.  Section Section 4 introduces the high-level report format and
   how to use it.  Sections Section 5 and Section 6 will describe the
   data elements of the cyber-physical extensions.  The appendices will
   include an XML schema for the extensions and a few examples Cyber-
   Physical Systems reports.

1.1.  What are Cyber-Physical Systems?

   Cyber-Physical Systems are computer- or microprocessor- or
   microcontroller-based systems that monitor and control physical
   processes [ACS].  A basic example of a control system is the heating
   system of a room.  The system is composed of a regulation knob,
   regulating box, heating device, thermostat, and appropriate cabling
   that links these devices.  A human sets the desired temperature and
   the control system continuously regulates the heating device in order
   to maintain the desired temperature throughout the day.  The current
   temperature of the room, which naturally will be much influenced by
   outside conditions, is continuously read by the controller through
   one or many sensors.  Such reading is fed back to the regulating box,
   which holds a control system algorithm that provides the rules on how



Murillo                       Informational                     [Page 5]
 
RFC 6684                     IODEF Extension               December 2013


   this regulation will take place.  More complex control systems are
   the core of industries such as oil, gas, water, nuclear, electric
   grid, and others.  For example, the electricity industry utilizes
   industry control systems to control the nuclear processes for the
   delivery of electricity.  In this case, the operators will be located
   in control rooms that continuously display the health of the systems
   and request asynchronous input from the operators.

   "Industrial control system" is a general term that include
   supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, distributed
   control systems (DCS), and others.  One of the primary differences
   between the two is that DCS are usually located within a more
   confined factory or plant-centric area, when compared to
   geographically dispersed SCADA field sites [RKAL].

1.2.  Components of a Cyber-Physical System

   Figure 1 illustrates a general composition of an industrial control
   system [ACS], [SFC].  Devices located at the Corporation Workspace
   (a), network (b), and operation workstation (c) could be considered
   mainstream IT infrastructure; these workstations run special programs
   that display the status of processes and are connected to a Local
   Area Network, a Wide Area Network, and possibly the Internet.

   From the control network (d) downwards, the infrastructure differs,
   with specialized protocols for control networks, specialized devices
   (PLCs and RTUs) that house automation algorithms (e), sensors and
   actuators that operate and measure physical variables (g), and
   specialized networking infrastructure and protocols (f).  The
   Operator Workstation (b) provides supervisory commands which are
   generally given by humans.  Partly as a result of the advent of the
   Internet and new powerful devices, control system infrastructure is
   increasingly inheriting some infrastructure from IT systems [SFC].

   Sensors (g) are devices that can measure temperature, pressure, water
   level, nuclear centrifuge rotor speed, and others.  Actuators (g)
   enable/disable/regulate heating elements, motor speed, water pumps,
   reservoir locks, and others.  Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)
   (e) house special control system algorithms that read sensors and
   command the actuators based on these readings and a multitude of
   control schemes; such task is done automatically in real-time.  PLCs
   are generally utilized to coordinate work in closed environments,
   while Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) are generally utilized to
   coordinate remote operations, task generally coordinated by control
   servers (c).

   An important fact about ICS is that Control networks are often more
   complex than plain IT systems and require a different level of

RFC 6684                     IODEF Extension               December 2013


   expertise: control networks are typically managed by control
   engineers, not IT personnel [SFC].

1.3.  Incidents in Cyber-Physical Systems

   In the context of cyber-physical systems (i.e. industrial control
   systems), an incident can be a mainstream IT incident itself (a, b,
   c) or the misbehaviour of a cyber-physical system (d, e, f, g, h) as
   a result of an IT incident.  See Figure 1.  The IT incident might
   intentionally seek to infiltrate the very PLCs and RTUs with aim to
   monitor and, in extreme scenarios, alter the operation of these
   devices and thus influence the operation of physical infrastructure.
   Incidents are known to be originated because numerous reasons,



Murillo                       Informational                     [Page 7]
 
RFC 6684                     IODEF Extension               December 2013


   including adversarial sources such as hostile governments, terrorist
   groups, industrial spies, disgruntled employees, malicious intruders,
   and natural sources such as system complexities, human errors and
   accidents, equipment failures, and natural disasters [SFC].

1.3.1.  Mainstream IT computer security incident

   As per IODEFs, an incident can be a:

   a.  Benign configuration issue

   b.  computer/network incident

   c.  infraction to a service level agreement (SLA)

   d.  system compromise

   e.  socially engineered phishing attack

   f.  denial-of-service (DoS) attack

   g.  others

1.3.2.  Cyber-physical system incident

   A Cyber-physical incident can imply the presence of all the above IT
   computer security incidents.  However, given the extra tasks carried
   out at lower layers (i.e. d - h) and the presence of dynamic physical
   infrastructure, the following issues are added to the incident list:

   a.  Control room alarm as a result of a 1) IT system misbehaviour
       (i.e one or more of the above), or 2) as a result of a physical
       system misbehaviour due to and IT system compromise, which might
       or might not have been detected

   b.  Misbehaviour of a physical system as noticed at the physical
       infrastructure level: explosion, flooding, pressure loss, and
       others

   c.  Misconfiguration or degradation of control system performance, as
       noticed by an operator.  Extremely sophisticated attacks carried
       out by control system experts might carry out these types of
       attacks (i.e. compromising/missconfiguring control system schemes
       such as feedback control, robust control, optimal control, fault
       detection and estimation, others)

   d.  The disruption of control systems operation due to the blocking
       of the flow of information through corporate or control networks



Murillo                       Informational                     [Page 8]
 
RFC 6684                     IODEF Extension               December 2013


       (d, f), thus causing information transfer bottlenecks or denial
       of service by IT-resident services (such as DNS) [SFC]

   e.  Illegal or unauthorized changes made to programmed instructions
       or variables in PLCs, RTUs, DCS, or SCADA controllers (alarm
       thresholds changed, unauthorized commands issued to control
       equipment).  This change can be benign or malign, with goals of
       damaging or disabling equipment (if tolerances are exceeded),
       premature shutdown of processes (i.e. electricity or gas
       transmission lines), and physical damage (explosion, flooding,
       and others).

   f.  False information sent to control system operators or to
       corporate HQ either to disguise unauthorized changes or to
       initiate inappropriate actions by system operators or other
       stakeholders SFC [SFC]

   g.  The modification of control system software or configuration
       settings, producing unpredictable results

   h.  Malicious software (e.g., virus, worm, Trojan horse) introduced
       into the system

   i.  Recipes (i.e., the materials and directions for creating a
       product) or work instructions modified in order to bring about
       damage to products, equipment, or personnel

   It is important to note that, regardless on how the attack in
   originated (Internet, portable storage, insider job), there will
   generally always be, at least, IT components involved.  Whether
   critical infrastructure is connected to the Internet is not a
   determinant on whether such will be attacked.

1.4.  Why the appropriate reporting of a control system is needed

   Control system incidents can cause irreparable harm to the physical
   system being controlled and to individuals.  The reporting of a
   control system incident could save lives.  A main goal of a well
   designed CPS attack will generally be to be unperceived and bypass
   basic (or mainstream) IT security defences in order to affect the
   physical world.  In these situations, a possible incident will be
   abnormal operation of a physical system, generally represented by a
   control room alarm, perceived odd behaviour, or, in extreme
   scenarios, explosions, flooding, or other forms of physical
   infrastructure misbehaviour.

   In this context, holding to report a physical incident until an IT
   incident surfaces (in case of a zero-day-worm attack, for example)



Murillo                       Informational                     [Page 9]
 
RFC 6684                     IODEF Extension               December 2013


   can be a matter of life and death, more when other similar facilities
   are operated in other points, or when these operate in conjunction
   with the others (i.e. electric grid, gas pipelines).  This is the
   case of the STUXNET worm, whose first observed symptom were the
   misbehaviour of nuclear centrifuges, with no control room alarms.  It
   was months until researchers were able to detect the IT worm.  The
   reporting of control system incidents from different locations could
   have possibly lead to its earlier detection.

   Thus, the reporting of a cyber-physical incident is extremely
   important.  By using a common format, it becomes easier for
   organizations to engage in coordination as well as correlation of
   information from multiple data sources or products into a cohesive
   view.  As the number of data sources increases, a common format
   becomes even more important, since otherwise multiple tools would be
   needed to interpret the different sources of data.  An important
   advantage of a common format is the ability to automate many of the
   analysis tasks and significantly speed up the response activities.

1.5.  Examples of physical system attacks/incidents (Eventual case
      studies for validation of the incident report)

   a.  Australia

   b.  US

   c.  Iran

   d.  Others

1.6.  What types of incidents to report?

   a.  Physical system incident, as observed by a stakeholder outside
       the control room (i.e. flooding, explosion, etc)

   b.  All incidents of Section Section 1.3.2

   c.  Mainstream cybersecurity incident in a control system
       infrastructure context, as observed by mainstream IT tools and
       reported by IODEF and its structured cybersecurity extension

   d.  Incidents related of the Internet of Things, especially in the
       context of the automation of buildings, vehicles, and other
       infrastructure

   e.  A combination of the above

RFC 6684                     IODEF Extension               December 2013


1.7.  Why a special extension is needed

   IODEF provides a means to describe a cyber-physical incident
   information, but it would need to include various non-structured
   types of incident-related data tailored to physical systems in order
   to convey more specific details about what is occurring.  Similarly,
   the IODEF-extension for structured cybersecurity information,
   currently a draft (draft-ietf-mile-sci-11.txt), would increase the
   machine readability of CPS incidents; however it would still need to
   be considerably modified in order to provide appropriate contextual
   machine readability.

   Further structure within IODEF through any means increases the
   machine-readability of the document thus providing a means for better
   automating certain cybersecurity operations.  Furthermore, because
   Cyber-Physical Systems are real-time and are for the most part
   automated, machine friendly data is paramount for effective incident
   response and coordination.  This is even more relevant when very
   frequent reports are needed in these real-time systems that can have
   complex dynamics.  Naturally this is also applicable, at a degree, to
   information in control room and even in corporate headquarters.

   For instance, a worm might use zero-day attack and a PLC rootkit to
   attack a nuclear reactor.  Special anomaly detection technology and
   backup sensors might detect unusual centrifuge control system input
   and output patterns.  The institution might have similar facilities
   in different points in the nation.  Then, enriched IODEF incident
   reports would be sent to other plants and to a central database.
   Such exchange of information would increase the chances to know
   quicker the source of the problem and to provide remediation.  In the
   context of several independent systems, incident reports would help
   control equipment vendors quickly pinpoint weaknesses or exploits
   that were taken advantage of and make adequate fixes.  In the case
   that a physical system is damaged, prompt incident reporting would
   avoid the same happening in other points.

   This reporting is not limited to public or mainstream private
   infrastructure (industry), but also to home automation systems and
   various environments that form part of the Internet of Things and
   could pose significant physical dangers if compromised.

1.8.  Relation to the IODEF Data Model

   Instead of defining a new report format, this document seeks to
   define an extension to [RFC5070].  The IODEF defines a flexible and
   extensible format and supports a granular level of specificity.
   These cyber-physical extensions will reuse subsets of the IODEF data
   model and specify new data elements.  Leveraging an existing



Murillo                       Informational                    [Page 11]
 
RFC 6684                     IODEF Extension               December 2013


   specification allows for more rapid adoption and reuse of existing
   tools in organizations.  For clarity, and in order to eliminate
   duplication, only the additional structures necessary for describing
   the exchange of cyber-physical activity will be provided; however the
   context of the location (i.e. different levels) will be considered in
   making appropriate decisions.

2.  Terminology Used in This Document

   Since many people use different but similar terms to mean the same
   thing, we underline the use of the following terminology in this
   document.

   a.  Cyber-Physical System.  Also referred in this document as
       Operational Technology Systems or Industry Control System or
       Automatic Control Systems.  Portions of a cyber-physical system
       can be considered a subset of Information Technology.

   b.  Cyber-physical event.  The compromise of the Control Network,
       Field Area Network, Physical Infrastructure, or the compromise of
       any resource that influences the operation of the those entities

   c.  Physical infrastructure.  Any physical infrastructure and
       premises that is part of a Cyber-physical system.  Among many
       others, this categorization includes: nuclear reactors, oil and
       gas pipelines, water and electricity distribution systems,
       electricity generation systems, chemical plants, oil refineries,
       weapons systems, railway systems, traffic control systems,
       health-related systems, and critical infrastructure that form
       part of the Internet of Things.

   d.  Control room.  Part of a control system infrastructure where
       humans monitor the overall status of the processes and make
       appropriate changes.  These changes can be: set-points for
       processes (i.e. the power/level at which nuclear centrifuges will
       function), shutting down processes under a failure, and others..

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The Elements of a physical system attack

   A cyber-physical attacks are normally comprised of the following
   components.  Data related to these elements or actors is key to
   capture in order make the event analysis and correlation with other



Murillo                       Informational                    [Page 12]
 
RFC 6684                     IODEF Extension               December 2013


   events more useful:

   a.  The main attacker or party perpetrating the sabotaging activity.
       Most times this party is not readily identifiable.

   b.  The command and control centre.  Generally compromised servers
       are at different locations.  These can be used for sending
       instructions and for acquiring data, among others.

   c.  The ultimately targeted physical infrastructure (nuclear
       centrifuges, boilers, pressure chambers, pipelines, liquid
       control systems, dams, room heating, traffic lights, railway
       systems etc).  Note that IT cybersecurity events might not have
       as a goal to target physical infrastructure, however might cause
       adverse consequences to these, as a result of a DoS attack, for
       example.

   d.  The devices that control the physical infrastructure: Control
       Network node(s), Field Area Network devices, Control Severs, and
       the wired and wireless networks and special protocols that
       connect them

   e.  Sensors and/or actuators that measure and manipulate physical
       infrastructure

   f.  The wired and/or wireless control network or field area network

   g.  The special control system algorithms that reside in PLCs,
       Control Servers, or sensor networks.  These algorithms are based
       on control theory that determines the type of control to use
       (basic feedback control, robust control, optimal control, and
       others) and its gain parameters (proportional, integral,
       derivative, etc) [SFC]

   h.  Special supervisory and fault detection and estimation agents
       that monitor processes.[MMJS]

   i.  Sensor networks, generally locally distributed sets of wireless
       devices that measure and actuate physical devices.  These are
       gradually being part of critical infrastructure.

   j.  The Internet or a removable device through which the malware
       infects the cyber-physical system

   k.  A human being, whom, willingly or unwillingly transports (and in
       some cases, injects) malware





Murillo                       Informational                    [Page 13]
 
RFC 6684                     IODEF Extension               December 2013


   l.  A control room operator (or operators) that regulate set-points,
       react to alarms, and carry out supervisory duties

   m.  Detection information and Analysis output

   n.  Input/Output logs.

3.1.  Cyber-Physical System Extensions to the IODEF-Document

   Cyber-Physical System events are reported in a Cyber-physical
   activity report, which is an instance of an XML IODEF-Document
   Incident element with added EventData and AdditionalData elements.
   The additional fields in the EventData specific to cyber-physical
   incidents are enclosed in a CyberPhysicalReport XML element.

   As a Cyber-Physical System attack may generate multiple reports to an
   incident team, multiple CyberPhysicalReports may be combined into one
   EventData structure, and multiple EventData structures may be
   combined into one incident report.  One IODEF incident report may
   record one or more individual Cyber-physical events and may include
   multiple EventData elements.

   This document will define new extension elements for the EventData
   IODEF XML elements and identifies those required in a
   CyberPhysicalReport.  The appendices will contain sample activity
   reports and a complete schema.  This Cyber-physical extension reuses
   subsets of the IODEF data model and, where appropriate, utilizes
   other extensions or specifies new data elements.

   The IODEF Extensions defined in this document comply with Section 4,
   "Extending the IODEF Format" in [RFC5070].

4.  Cyber-physical Reporting via IODEF-Documents

4.1.  Report Types

   As described in the following subsections, reporting cyber-physical
   events has three primary components: choosing a report type, a format
   for the data, and how to check the correctness of the format.

   Similarly, there are three actions relating to reporting CPS events.
   First, a reporter or an automated system may *create* and exchange a
   new report on a new event.  Secondly, a reporter may *update* a
   previously exchanged report to indicate new information.  Lastly, a
   reporter may have realized that the report is in error or contains
   significant incorrect data and that the prudent reaction is to
   *delete* the report.




Murillo                       Informational                    [Page 14]
 
RFC 6684                     IODEF Extension               December 2013


   The three types of reports are denoted through the use of the ext-
   purpose attribute of an Incident element.  A new report contains an
   empty or a "create" ext-purpose value; an updated report contains an
   ext-value value of "update"; a request for deletion contains a
   "delete" ext-purpose value.  Note that this is actually an advisory
   for the report originator or recipients; operations might decide to
   file a new report with updated information.  The nature of industry
   control systems will generally favour the later one, with exception
   of erroneously human-generated serious incidents.

   Furthermore, administrators might decide to utilize this reporting in
   order to coordinate operations among different facilities, including
   SCADA networks.  The machine friendliness of the report favour such,
   especially when automated reports are needed and when new
   infrastructure arises.  Utilized in an automated way, it can be a
   tool to determine the health of most of the CPS infrastructure and
   conveniently inform various stakeholders in an standardized and
   straightforward manner.  Other applications within CPS systems can
   vary, including its incorporation as a mainstream communication
   scheme.

4.2.  CyberPhysicalReport Report XML (possible/alternative)
      Representations

   The IODEF Incident element ([RFC5070], Section 3.2) is summarized
   below.  It and the rest of the data model presented in Section
   Section 5 is expressed in Unified Modeling Language (UML) syntax as
   used in the IODEF specification.  The UML representation is for
   illustrative purposes only; elements are specified in XML as defined
   in Appendix A.

   embedded in the iodef:AdditionalData element of iodef:EventData.  The
   CyberPhysicalReport element is added to the IODEF using its defined
   extension procedure documented in Section 5 of [RFC5070].

   One IODEF-Document may contain information on multiple incidents with
   information for each incident contained within an iodef:Incident
   element ([RFC5070], Section 3.12).

4.3.  Syntactical Correctness of Cyber-Physical Reports

   The cyber-physical report MUST pass XML validation using the schema
   defined in [RFC5070] and the extensions that will be defined in
   Appendix A of this document.

5.  SCyberPhysicalReport Element Definitions

   A CyberPhysicalReport consists of an extension to the
   Incident.EventData.AdditionalData element with a dtype of "xml".  The
   elements of the CyberPhysicalReport will specify information about
   the components of activity identified in Section Section 5.
   Additional forensic information and commentary can be added by the
   reporter as necessary to show relation to other events, to show the
   output of an investigation, or for archival purposes.  The inclusion
   of already existing reporting standards is possible through an
   appropriate element.

5.1.  CyberPhysicalReport Structure

   A CyberPhysicalReport element is structured as follows.  The
   components of a CyberPhysicalReport are introduced in functional
   grouping, as some parameters are related and some elements may not
   make sense individually.

                 Figure 3: The CyberPhysicalReport Element

5.2.  Reuse of IODEF-Defined Elements

   Elements, attributes, and parameters defined in the base IODEF
   specification are to be used whenever possible in the definition of
   the CyberPhysicalReport XML element.

5.3.  Element and Attribute Specification Format

   1.  A terse XML-type identifier for the element or attribute.

   2.  An indication of whether the element or attribute is REQUIRED or
       optional.  Mandatory items are noted as REQUIRED.  If not
       specified, elements are optional.  Note that when optional
       elements are included, they may REQUIRE specific sub-elements.

   3.  A description of the element or attribute and its intended use.

   Elements that contain sub-elements or enumerated values are further

   sub-sectioned.  Note that there is no "trickle-up" effect in
   elements.  That is, the required elements of a sub-element are only
   populated if the sub-element is used.

5.4.  Version Attribute

   REQUIRED.  STRING.  The version shall be the value ___, to be
   compliant with this document.

5.5.  IncdntType Attribute

   Describes the characteristics of the exploit that was used for making
   the attack.

5.15.  The EntryPoint element

   Describes the device (router, PC, etc.) through which a worm or other
   threat entered the system.  Note that the exploit does not necessary
   reside at the EntryPoint.

5.16.  The PerpetratingParty element

   Identifies the originator of the attack, this being a human being,
   nation state or others.

5.17.  The DetectionMethod element

5.22.  The RecurrencePreventionMeasures element

   Describes the measures that must be taken for the incident not to
   repeat.

5.23.  The BriefDescriptionOfIncident element

   Describes a human friendly description of the incident.  While the
   previousreporting elements should be enough to characterize an
   incident, this might provide additional information.

5.24.  The Logs element

   Takes the raw control system input/output, supervisory and other
   logs.

5.25.  The References element

   Provides with any resources that were used in the detection and
   amelioration of the incident.

5.26.  The ProtocolType element

   GE Fanuc; Siemens Sinaut; Mitsubishi; Modbus RTU / ASCII; Omron;
   Toshiba; Westinghouse; Other Vendor Protocols

5.27.  The NetworkType element

   Provides with more idea of the network.  Wide area networks: Analog
   point to point and multi-point modem networks, frame relay/Cell relay
   type point to point and multi-point networks, wireless Radio/
   Satellite networks, fibre optic based networks

6.  Mandatory IODEF and CyberPhysicalReport Elements

   A report Cyber-Physical System report requires certain identifying
   information that is contained within the standard IODEF Incident data
   structure and the CyberPhysicalReport extensions.  The required
   attributes are a combination of those required by the base IODEF
   element and those eventually required by this document.  Attributes
   identified as required SHALL be populated in conforming Cyber-
   Physical System reports.

   In case this draft extension will eventually embed structured
   cybersecurity information defined by other specifications, the
   implementation of this draft MUST be capable of sending and receiving
   the XML conforming to the specification listed in an initial IANA

RFC 6684                     IODEF Extension               December 2013


   table without error.  The receiver MUST be capable of validating
   received XML documents that are embedded inside that against their
   schemata.  Note that the receiver can look up the namespace in an
   IANA table to understand what specifications the embedded XML
   documents follows.

6.1.  An Example XML

   To be populated

6.2.  An XML Schema for the Extension

   To be populated

7.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a format for encoding a particular class of
   security incidents appropriate for exchange across organizations.  As
   merely a data representation, it does not directly introduce security
   issues.  However, given the comprehensiveness a report might have and
   the frequency of reports, third parties might be able to generate
   infrastructure characteristics, dynamics, and other parameters that,
   in extreme scenarios, might constitute industrial espionage.  For
   this reason, the underlying message format and transport protocol
   used MUST ensure the appropriate degree of confidentiality,
   integrity, and authenticity for the specific environment.
   Organizations that exchange data using this document are URGED to
   develop operating procedures that document the following areas of
   concern.

7.1.  Transport-Specific Concerns

   The critical security concerns are that cyber-physical incident
   reports may be falsified or the CyberPhysicalReport may become
   corrupt during transit.  In areas where transmission security or
   secrecy is questionable, the application of a digital signature
   and/or message encryption on each report will counteract both of
   these concerns.  We expect that each exchanging organization will
   determine the need, and mechanism, for transport protection.

7.2.  Using the iodef:restriction Attribute

   In some instances, data values in particular elements may contain
   data deemed sensitive by the reporter.  Although there are no
   general-purpose rules on when to mark certain values as "private" or
   "need-to-know" via the iodef:restriction attribute, the reporter is
   cautioned not to apply element-level sensitivity markings unless they
   believe the receiving party (i.e., the party they are exchanging the

RFC 6684                     IODEF Extension               December 2013


   event report data with) has a mechanism to adequately safeguard and
   process the data as marked.  Information that is considered sensitive
   can be marked as such using the restriction parameter of each data
   element.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemata
   [XMLschemaPart1] [XMLschemaPart2] conforming to a registry mechanism
   described in [RFC3688].

   It is still to be determined whether this memo will create a registry
   for IANA to manage.

9.  Manageability Considerations

   If any of the operational and/or management considerations listed in
   Appendix A of [RFC5706] apply to this extension, they will be
   addressed in this section.  If no such considerations apply, this
   section can be omitted.

10.  Appendix A: XML Schema Definition for Extension

   The XML Schema describing the elements defined in the Extension
   Definition section will be given here.  Each of the examples in
   Section 11 will be verified to validate against this schema by
   automated tools.

11.  Appendix B: Examples

   This section will contain example IODEF Documents illustrating the
   extension.  If example situations are outlined in the applicability
   section, documents for those examples should be provided in the same
   order as in the applicability section.  Example documents will be
   tested to validate against the schema given in the appendix.
