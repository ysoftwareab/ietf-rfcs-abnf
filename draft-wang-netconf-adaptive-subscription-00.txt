              draft-wang-netconf-adaptive-subscription-00

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model and associated mechanism
   enabling subscriber's adaptive subscriptions to a publisher's event
   streams.  Applying these elements allows a subscriber to
   automatically adjust the volume of telemetry traffic sent from
   publisher to the receivers.

1.  Introduction

   YANG-Push subscriptions [RFC8641] allow client applications to
   subscribe to continuous datastore updates without needing to poll.
   It defines a mechanism (i.e.,update trigger) to determine when an
   update record needs to be generated.  Two type of subscriptions are
   introduced in [RFC8641], distinguished by how updates are triggered:
   periodic and on-change.

   o  Periodic subscription allows subscribed data to be streamed to the
      destination at a configured fixed periodic interval

   o  On-change subscription allows update to be triggered when whenever
      a change in the subscribed information is detected.  The periodic
      interval is set to zero value in the on-change subscription case.

   However in some cases (e.g., wireless channel contention and
   interference causes the WLAN throughput and per-packet delays to vary
   over time), both collectors and publishers are configured with
   multiple periodic intervals and the subscribed data set can be
   streamed out to the destination at adaptive sampling or export rate,
   e.g., when wireless signal strength drops below a certain threshold,
   more data should be collected at high frequency.

   This document defines a YANG data model and associated mechanism
   enabling subscriber's adaptive subscriptions to a publisher's event
   streams.  Applying these elements allows a subscriber to

   automatically adjust the volume of telemetry traffic sent from
   publisher to the receivers.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the following terms:

   Event:  Something that happens which may be of interest or trigger
      the invocation of the rule.  A fault, an alarm, a change in
      network state, network security threat, hardware malfunction,
      buffer untilization crossing a threshold, network connection
      setup, an external input to the system, for example [RFC3877].

   Client:  Defined in [RFC8342].

   Configuration:   Defined in [RFC8342].

   Configured subscription:  Defined in [RFC8639]

   Configuration datastore:    Defined in [RFC8342].

   Notification message:   Information intended for a receiver
      indicating that one or more events have occurred [RFC8639].

   Publisher:  An entity responsible for streaming notification messages
      per the terms of a subscription [RFC8639].

   Receiver:  A target to which a publisher pushes subscribed event
      records.  For dynamic subscriptions, the receiver and subscriber
      are the same entity [RFC8639].

   Subscriber:   A client able to request and negotiate a contract for
      the generation and push of event records from a publisher.  For
      dynamic subscriptions, the receiver and subscriber are the same
      entity [RFC8639].

   Subscription:  A contract with a publisher, stipulating the
      information that one or more receivers wish to have pushed from
      the publisher without the need for further solicitation [RFC8639].

Internet-Draft            Adaptive Subscription               March 2020


   On-change subscription:  A datastore subscription with updates that
      are triggered when changes in subscribed datastore nodes are
      detected.

   Periodic subscription:  A datastore subscription with updates that
      are triggered periodically according to some time interval.

2.  Model Overview

   The YANG data model for the "Adaptive Subscription to YANG
   Notification" augments the "update-trigger" in the YANG Push model to
   add a "adaptive-period" case.  Under the "adaptive-period" case, a
   "adaptive-period" list is defined.  The "adaptive-period" list uses
   the key "id" for indexing.  Within the "adaptive-period" list, an
   "interval" leaf and the corresponding trigger conditions are defined.
   When the trigger condition is satisfied, e.g., "op-field" exceeds the
   "op-value" and the change of "op-field" is monotonically increasing,
   the update interval will be changed into the value of "interval" leaf
   and the objects being filtered will be exported every interval
   specified by the value of "interval" leaf.  The "anchor-time" is used
   to indciate at which points in time periodic updates need to be
   assembled and sent.

   The following tree diagrams [RFC8340] provide an overview of the data
   model for "ietf-adaptive-subscription.yang" module.

4.2.  Updates to the YANG Module Names Registry

   This document registers two YANG modules in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC7950]. . Following the format in [RFC6020], the
   following registration has been made:

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      Name:         ietf-adaptive-subscription
      Namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-adaptive-subscription
      Prefix:       as
      Reference:    RFC xxxx
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive in some
   network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these
   data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /sn:subscriptions/sn:subscription/yp:update-trigger/adaptive-
      periods/adaptive-period/id

   o  /sn:subscriptions/sn:subscription/yp:update-trigger/adaptive-
      periods/adaptive-period/interval

Appendix A.  Adaptive Subscription Example

   The example YANG module used in this document represents performance
   data telemetry on a simple optical device.  The collector can control
   the rate of telemtry data to be streamed to the destination by
   switching to different time interval for the update to be sent.

   The adaptive subscription model can be used to keep track of
   performance data change such as temperature, voltage, power,cup
   usage.  In addition, it can adjust update period based on performance
   data change, e.g., when the current receiving power is higher than
   the pre-configured threshold, the notification for the optical

   performance data from publisher can be sent at a low frequency.  When
   the current receiving power is lower than the pre-configured
   threshold, the notification for the optical performance data can be
   sent at a high frequency.

   In another example, when the time interval for update to be sent is
   set to 5 seconds and specific performance data,e.g., 5 receiving
   power values
   (0.48dB&#12289;0.57dB&#12289;0.61dB&#12289;0.69dB&#12289;0.70dB) can
   be sampled per second and collected during this time interval
   changes.  When power changes exceed the preconfigured threhold
   (e.g.,0.20dB), all these 5 receiving power values falling within
   detection time window or update time interval should be published to
   the destinations for data analysis.
