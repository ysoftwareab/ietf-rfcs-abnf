     1. Introduction 

        This document attempts to capture VoIP use cases for Session 
        Initiation Protocol (SIP)[1] based peering.  Identifying use cases 
        will help to understand and clarify requirements.  These use cases 
        will assist in identifying requirements for VoIP Peering using SIP 
        and provide a perspective on future specifications. 
         
        Only use cases related to VoIP such as VoIP are considered in this 
        document.  Other real-time SIP communications use cases, like Instant 
        Messaging (IM) and presence are out of scope for this document.  
        Thus, use cases described herein are use cases of VoIP using SIP.  In 
        describing use cases, the intent is descriptive, not prescriptive.   
         
        There are existing documents [2][3][4][5][6] that have captured use 
        case scenarios.  This draft draws from those documents.  The document 
        contains three categories of use cases; Direct, Indirect and 
        Assisted.  The use cases contained in this document attempts to be as 
        comprehensive as possible, but should not be considered complete. 
         
     2. Terminology 

        The terminology for this draft will be draw from the Speermint 
        terminology draft. [15]

     3. Use Cases 

        Use cases are sorted into 3 groupings: Direct, Indirect and Assisted. 
        Though there may be some overlap among the use cases in these 
        categories, there are different requirements between the scenarios 
        and this document serves to help identify the requirements for SIP 
        Peering for VoIP. 

        Per information in the Speermint terminology draft, the direct use 
        cases involve those cases in which two service providers interconnect 
        without using an intervening layer 5 network.  This approach is also 
        considered a bi-lateral peering agreement.

        Indirect use cases involve the use of a third party that both the O-
        VSP and T-VSP have in common.  This has been referred to as Transit 
        peering as well. 

        Assisted use cases involve the use of a third party, but this third 
        party may or may not have a pre-existing relationship with the T-VSP. 
        The A-VSP may only provide next-hop discovery for the O-VSP, or may 
        be more intimately involved my maintaining session state in both the 
        signaling and bearer planes. 

     3.1. Direct Use Cases 

        There are intra-domain message flows within the use cases to serve a 
        supporting background.  The inter-domain communications is germane to 
        Speermint. 

     3.1.1. Minimalist Direct 

          1. O-UE initiates a call = SIP INVITE 

          2. O-SM queries for next-hop information from routing database. 

          3. Routing database entity replies with route to called party 

          4. Call sent to terminating domains session manager. 

          5. Session manager sends call to called party.

     3.1.1.1. Administrative characteristics 

        The minimalist direct use case is typically implemented in a scenario 
        where exists a strong degree of trust between the 2 administrative 
        domains.  Neither the Originating nor Terminating domains have a 
        dedicated network element (i.e. Session Border Element - SBE) that 
        serves any domain demarcation purpose.  This can and should be 
        considered an “Open” peering model. 

     3.1.2. Direct with one SBE  

        In this type of interconnection scenario, the SBE is owned and 
        operated within the originating administrative domain.  

          1. O-UE initiates a call. 

          2. The O-SM performs next-hop determination for the called party 
             via the LS.  This can be done via ENUM/DNS/Redirect 3XX multiple 
             choices and/or static routing.  

          3. The result of the query will be O-SBE that is interconnected to 
             the terminating domain, but administered in the originating 
             domain.  

          4. Proxy will signal O-SBE.   

          5. O-SBE routes call to T-SM within terminating domain. 

          6. T-SM signals the called party, T-UE.

        Figure 3 Direct with one SBEs 
         
     3.1.2.1. Administrative characteristics 

        The direct peering with a single SBE is typically implemented in the 
        scenario where the Originating domain is a VoIP Service Provider 
        (VSP) and the Terminating domain is an Enterprise IP telephony 
        deployment. The SBEs provides the VSP with the ability to support 
        overlapping RFC1918 address space via NAT, Session limiting, Session 
        “scrubbing” to permit only certain SDP options, etc. 

     3.1.3. Direct with two SBEs 

        Multiple SBCs are implemented in this interconnection scenario.  The 
        SBEs are operated within different administrative domains.   

          1. O-UE initiates a call. 

          2. The O-SM performs next-hop determination for the called party 
             via the LS.  This can be done via ENUM/DNS/Redirect 3XX multiple 
             choices and/or static routing.  

          3. The result of the query will be O-SBE that is interconnected to 
             the terminating domain, but administered in the originating 
             domain.  

          4. Proxy will signal O-SBE.   

          5. O-SBE routes call to T-SBE within terminating domain.

        Figure 5 Indirect with Assisted PSP 

         
     3.2.1.1. Administrative Characteristics 

        The Transit peering use case is normally implemented due to a 
        business or trust relationship between the either the originating 
        domain and transit, and/or the terminating domain and the transit 
        domain.   

        Orig Domain .--. Transit = Relationship O-T

     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-speermint-voip-consolidated-usecases  May 2007 
         

        In the O-T relationship, typical policies, features or functions that 
        deem this relationship necessary are NP, Ubiquity of termination 
        options, and masquerading of originating VoIP network gear. 

        Term Domain .--. Transit = Relationship T-T 

        In the T-T relationship, typical policies, features or functions 
        observed consist of codec “scrubbing”, anonimizing, and transcoding. 

     3.3. Assisted 

        Assisted use cases involve the facilitation of direct session 
        establishment between the O-VSP and T-VSP.  There may exist elements 
        that provide SIP proxy functionality, and are often implemented in 
        practice by SBE’s which may "filter" "normalize" and provide network-
        hiding for incoming messages en route to their final destination.  
        Fear and distrust coupled with continued interoperability and 
        security concerns have revived the need for the neutral central 
        element role enabled by this peering model. 

        Popularity of this model can be attributed to the concentration of 
        functions provided by A-PSP.  As an external element, A-PSP can 
        provide the full set of services for VSPs, and through its own 
        relationships with the VSP, eliminate the need of all VSPs for pair-
        wise service relationships.  A-PSP can potentially encompass a large 
        namespace of users that is accessible in one query to external VSP 
        members (or not -depending on policy).   

        In addition there is an interoperability function usually performed 
        by an SBE, almost guaranteeing interoperability and protocol 
        interchangeability between member VSPs.  As part of the 
        interoperability there is also is media sub-function enabling the 
        federation to enforce a standard set of codecs or alternatively 
        provide transcoding functionality to make sure there is media 
        interoperability as well. Finally, A-PSP can implement the routing 
        function enabling traffic shaping and throttling across the 
        federation. 

     3.3.1. Assisted PSP 

        This is a direct call flow, as in the minimalist approach, but with a 
        PSP aiding the originating domain. 

          1. O-UE initiates a call.

     4. Federations 

          This section discusses the federation concept, explains which 
          technical parameters make up the foundation of a federation and 
          provides examples. 
           
          Contrary to the previous section, this section does not focus on 
          specific implementation details like the presence of SBCs or other 
          border elements. The aim here is to provide a broader view on what 
          kinds of arrangements are possible. 
           
          The concrete implementation details (e.g. "direct with one SBC" 
          versus "direct with two SBCs") is often orthogonal to this list. To 
          recapitulate:  A federation is a group of VSPs which agree to 
          receive calls from each other using pre-agreed technical and 
          administrative procedures. 
         

     4.1. Federation Categorization 

          The technical procedures which federations need to define can be 
          used to categorize them. Each federation has to specify how a few 
          core operations which are to be performed by its members. 
           
          These include: 
           
          1. Peer Discovery 

          This specifies how a VSPs discovers that he can place a specify 
          call to a peering partner in this federation. 
           
          Possible solution are e.g.: a manually configured list of TN-
          prefixes and domain names, automatically obtained list of reachable 
          prefixes/domains by some sort if intra-federation route 
          announcements, trial queries to the federation's LS, trial lookups 
          in federation-internal databases (e.g. private DNS),public database 
          lookups (e.g. I-ENUM). 
         
          2. Location Server 

          What methods are used for TN to URI mapping? 
           
          Examples: Public User-ENUM, public Infrastructure ENUM, private 
          ENUM tree, SIP Redirect, DUNDi. 
           
          3. Next Hop Domain Resolution 

      
      
     Uzelac (et al.)       Expires Dec 15, 2007              [Page 12] 
         






     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-speermint-voip-consolidated-usecases  May 2007 
         

          If the LS did not return an URI of the form sip:user@IP-address, 
          then the originating VSP has to translate the domain part of the  
          URI to an IP-address (plus perhaps fall-backs) in order to contact 
          the next hop.  
           
          Examples: RFC3263 in the public DNS. RFC3263 in a federation 
          private DNS. RFC3263 in the public DNS with split-DNS, P2P SIP, 
          modified RFC3263 in the public DNS (e.g. a federation-specific 
          prefix to the domain name). 
         
          4. Call Setup 

          The federation may also define specifics on what SIP features need 
          to be used when contacting the next hop in order to a) reach the 
          next hop at all and b) to prove that the sender is a legitimate 
          peering partner. 
           
          Examples: hard-code transport (TCP/UDP/TLS), non-standard port 
          number, specific source IP address (e.g. in a private L3 network), 
          which TLS client certificate to use, other authentication scheme. 
            
          5. Filtering Incoming Calls 

          On the receiving side, the border element needs to determine 
          whether the INVITE it just received really came from a member   of 
          the federation. This is the flip side of 4. 
           
          Example: verify TLS cert, check incoming interface/VLAN,check 
          source IP address against a configured list of valid ones. 
         
     4.2. Federation Examples 

          This section lists some examples of how federations can operate. 
           
     4.2.1. Trivial Federations 

          A private peering arrangement between two VSPs is a special case of 
          a federation. These two VSP have agreed to exchange calls amongst 
          themselves and they have set up whatever SBC/LS/SBE plus Layer 
          3infrastructure they need to route and complete the calls. 
           
          It is thus not needed to treat bi-lateral peerings as conceptually 
          different to federation-based peering. 
           
          On the other extreme, the set of all VSPs implementing an open SIP 
          service according to RFCs 3261/3263/3761 also fulfills the 
          definition of a federation.  In that case, the technical rules are 
      
      
     Uzelac (et al.)       Expires Dec 15, 2007              [Page 13] 
         






     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-speermint-voip-consolidated-usecases  May 2007 
         

          contained in these three RFCs, the LS is the public DNS. Whether 
          some of these VSPs use SBCs as border elements is not relevant. 
           
          The administrative model of this federation is the "email model": 
          There is no "member list", any SIP server operating on the Internet 
          which implements call routing according to these RFCs is implicitly 
          a member of that federation. No business relationship is needed 
          between "members", thus no money is likely to change hands for 
          terminating calls. There is no contractual protection against 
          nuisance calls, SPIT, or denial of service attacks. 
         
     4.2.2. Access List based 

          If running an open SIP proxy is not desired, then a group of VSPs 
          which want to allow calls from each other can collect the list of 
          IP addresses of all their border elements. 
           
          This list is redistributed to all members which use it to configure 
          firewalls in front of their ingress elements.  Thus calls from 
          other members of this federation are accepted while calls from 
          other hosts on the Internet are blocked. 
           
          Whether VSPs deploy SBCs as border elements is not relevant.  Call 
          routing can still be done via standard RFC rules. 
           
          Whenever a new member joins this club every other VSP needs to 
          adapt its filter rules. 
           
     4.2.3. TLS based Federations 

          Another option to restrict incoming calls to federation members is 
          to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates as access 
          control. This works best if the federation runs a certificate 
          authority (CA) which signs the TLS keys of each member VSP.  Thus 
          the ingress element of a VSP needs to check only whether the client 
          certificate presented by the calling SIP proxy contains a proper 
          signature from that CA. 
           
          Adding support for Certificate Revocation Lists solves the issue of 
          blocking calls from former members of that federation.  The main 
          benefit of this model is that no changes need to be made at the 
          ingress element of all old members whenever a VSP joins that

     4.2.4. Central SIP Proxy 

          One way to simplify the management of these firewall rules is to 
          route all SIP messages via a central proxy. 
           
          In that case, all federation members just need to open up their 
          ingress elements to requests from that central server. A new VSP 
          just triggers a change in the configuration of this box and not at 
          all other VSPs. 
           
          Although such a setup reduces the configuration complexity of 
          larger federations, the central SIP proxy might lead to other 
          scaling issues. 
           
          This is an example of Assisted Peering. 
         
           
     4.2.5. Private Layer 3 Network 

          Federations can also establish a separate layer 3 network for their 
          peering traffic. This could be implemented e.g. by creating a new 
          VLAN at an Internet exchange point to which all members of that 
          federation connect their SBEs. 
           
          Alternatively, a federation can establish a smaller version of the 
          Internet to which only members are allowed to connect.  The GRX 
          network of the mobile operators is an example of a dedicated layer 
          3 infrastructure. 
           
          Such a private layer 3 network can also be implemented using 
          virtual private network (VPN) technologies like IPsec. 
           
          In all these cases the SBE can assume that any SIP requests it 
          receives via an interfaces located in this L3 network comes from 
          legitimate peering partner. 
           
          The separation of the peering network from the Internet makes it 
          easier to protect the peering arrangement from attacks and to 
          ensure QoS. 
           
     4.2.6. Peer to Peer SIP 

          P2PSIP replaces the RFC3263 rules by a lookup in a distributed hash 
          table (DHT). A federation could use this technology to implement 
          call routing between the peers: the border elements of all members 
          participate in the DHT algorithm and distribute routing information 
          this way.

          Only members of the federation thus can use information stored in 
          the DHT which could be the basis of both call routing within the 
          federation as well as access control between members. 
           
     4.2.7. DUNDi 

          Distributed Universal Number Discovery (DUNDi) 
          [http://www.dundi.com/dundi.txt] can also be used to build 
          federations: DUNDi itself acts as a distributed LS which can add 
          dynamically generated passwords to the URIs it returns. 
           
          This way, the T-SBE can verify that an incoming calls comes from a 
          member of this DUNDi cloud. 
           
     5. Security Considerations 

          This document introduces no new security considerations.  However, 
          it is important to note that session interconnect, as described in 
          this document, has a wide variety of security issues that should be    
          considered in documents addressing both protocol and use case  
          analyzes. 
           
     6. IANA Considerations 

          This document creates no new requirements on IANA namespaces    
          [RFC2434].
