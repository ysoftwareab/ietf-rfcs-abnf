            Advanced Unidirectional Route Assessment (AURA)
                        draft-ietf-ippm-route-08

Abstract

   This memo introduces an advanced unidirectional route assessment
   (AURA) metric and associated measurement methodology, based on the IP
   Performance Metrics (IPPM) Framework RFC 2330.  This memo updates RFC
   2330 in the areas of path-related terminology and path description,
   primarily to include the possibility of parallel subpaths between a
   given Source and Destination pair, owing to the presence of multi-
   path technologies.

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                June 2020


1.  Introduction

   The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group first created a
   framework for metric development in [RFC2330].  This framework has
   stood the test of time and enabled development of many fundamental
   metrics.  It has been updated in the area of metric composition
   [RFC5835], and in several areas related to active stream measurement
   of modern networks with reactive properties [RFC7312].

   The [RFC2330] framework motivated the development of "performance and
   reliability metrics for paths through the Internet," and Section 5 of
   [RFC2330] defines terms that support description of a path under
   test.  However, metrics for assessment of path components and related
   performance aspects had not been attempted in IPPM when the [RFC2330]
   framework was written.

   This memo takes up the route measurement challenge and specifies a
   new route metric, two practical frameworks for methods of measurement
   (using either active or hybrid active-passive methods [RFC7799]), and
   Round-Trip Delay and link information discovery using the results of
   measurements.  All route measurements are limited by the willingness
   of hosts along the path to be discovered, to cooperate with the
   methods used, or to recognize that the measurement operation is
   taking place (such as when tunnels are present).

1.1.  Issues with Earlier Work to define Route

   Section 7 of [RFC2330] presented a simple example of a "route" metric
   along with several other examples.  The example is reproduced below
   (where the reference is to Section 5 of [RFC2330]):

   "route: The path, as defined in Section 5, from A to B at a given
   time."

   This example provides a starting point to develop a more complete
   definition of route.  Areas needing clarification include:

   Time:  In practice, the route will be assessed over a time interval,
      because active path detection methods like [PT] rely on TTL limits
      for their operation and cannot accomplish discovery of all hosts
      using a single packet.

   Type-P:  The legacy route definition lacks the option to cater for
      packet-dependent routing.  In this memo, we assess the route for a
      specific packet of Type-P, and reflect this in the metric
      definition.  The methods of measurement determine the specific
      Type-P used.

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                June 2020


   Parallel Paths:  Parallel paths are a reality of the Internet and a
      strength of advanced route assessment methods, so the metric must
      acknowledge this possibility.  Use of Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP)
      and Unequal Cost Multi-Path (UCMP) technologies are common sources
      of parallel subpaths.

   Cloud Subpath:  May contain hosts that do not decrement TTL or Hop
      Limit, but may have two or more exchange links connecting
      "discoverable" hosts or routers.  Parallel subpaths contained
      within clouds cannot be discovered.  The assessment methods only
      discover hosts or routers on the path that decrement TTL or Hop
      Count, or cooperate with interrogation protocols.  The presence of
      tunnels and nested tunnels further complicate assessment by hiding
      hops.

   Hop:  Although the [RFC2330] definition of a hop was a link-host
      pair, only hosts that are discoverable or have the capability to
      cooperate with interrogation protocols where link information may
      be exposed.

   The refined definition of Route metrics begins in the sections that
   follow.

2.  Scope

   The purpose of this memo is to add new route metrics and methods of
   measurement to the existing set of IPPM metrics.

   The scope is to define route metrics that can identify the path taken
   by a packet or a flow traversing the Internet between two hosts.
   Although primarily intended for hosts communicating on the Internet
   with IP, the definitions and metrics are constructed to be applicable
   to other network domains, if desired.  The methods of measurement to
   assess the path may not be able to discover all hosts comprising the
   path, but such omissions are often deterministic and explainable
   sources of error.

   Also, to specify a framework for active methods of measurement which
   use the techniques described in [PT] at a minimum, and a framework
   for hybrid active-passive methods of measurement, such as the Hybrid
   Type I method [RFC7799] described in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data](intended only for single administrative
   domains), which do not rely on ICMP and provide a protocol for
   explicit interrogation of nodes on a path.  Combinations of active
   methods and hybrid active-passive methods are also in-scope.

   Further, this memo provides additional analysis of the round-trip
   delay measurements made possible by the methods, in an effort to

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                June 2020


   discover more details about the path, such as the link technology in
   use.

   This memo updates Section 5 of [RFC2330] in the areas of path-related
   terminology and path description, primarily to include the
   possibility of parallel subpaths between a given Source and
   Destination address pair (possibly resulting from Equal Cost Multi-
   Path (ECMP) and Unequal Cost Multi-Path (UCMP) technologies).

   There are several simple non-goals of this memo.  There is no attempt
   to assess the reverse path from any host on the path to the host
   attempting the path measurement.  The reverse path contribution to
   delay will be that experienced by ICMP packets (in active methods),
   and may be different from delays experienced by UDP or TCP packets.
   Also, the round trip delay will include an unknown contribution of
   processing time at the host that generates the ICMP response.
   Therefore, the ICMP-based active methods are not supposed to yield
   accurate, reproducible estimations of the Round-Trip Delay that UDP
   or TCP packets will experience.

3.  Route Metric Terms and Definitions

   This section sets requirements for the following components to
   support the Route Metric:

   Host  A Host as defined in [RFC2330] (a computer capable of IP
      communication, includes routers), a.k.a.  RFC 2330 Host.

   Node   A Node is any network function on the path capable of IP-layer
      Communication, includes RFC 2330 Hosts.

   Node Identity  The unique address for Nodes communicating within the
      network domain.  For Nodes communicating on the Internet with IP,
      it is the globally routable IP address(es) which the Node uses
      when communicating with other Nodes under normal or error
      conditions.  The Node Identity revealed (and its connection to a
      Node Name through reverse DNS) determines whether interfaces to
      parallel links can be associated with a single Node, or appear to
      identify unique Nodes.

   Discoverable Node  Nodes that convey their Node Identity according to
      the requirements of their network domain, such as when error
      conditions are detected by that Node.  For Nodes communicating
      with IP packets, compliance with Section 3.2.2.4 of [RFC1122] when
      discarding a packet due to TTL or Hop Limit Exceeded condition,
      MUST result in sending the corresponding Time Exceeded message
      (containing a form of Node identity) to the source.  This

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                June 2020


      requirement is also consistent with section 5.3.1 of [RFC1812] for
      routers.

   Cooperating Node  Nodes that MUST respond to direct queries for their
      Node identity as part of a previously agreed and established
      interrogation protocol.  Nodes SHOULD also provide information
      such as arrival/departure interface identification, arrival
      timestamp, and any relevant information about the Node or specific
      link which delivered the query to the Node.

   Hop  A Hop MUST contain a Node Identity, and MAY contain arrival and/
      or departure interface identification, round trip delay, and an
      arrival timestamp.

   Routing Class  A route that treats equally a class C of different
      types of packets.  Knowledge of such a class allows any one of the
      types of packets within that class to be used for subsequent
      measurement of the route.

3.1.  Formal Name

   Type-P-Route-Ensemble-Method-Variant, abbreviated as Route Ensemble.

   Note that Type-P depends heavily on the chosen method and variant.

3.2.  Parameters

   This section lists the REQUIRED input factors to specify a Route
   metric.

   o  Src, the address of a Node (such as the globally routable IP
      address).

   o  Dst, the address of a Node (such as the globally routable IP
      address).

   o  i, the limit on the number of Hops a specific packet may visit as
      it traverses from the Node at Src to the Node at Dst (such as the
      TTL or Hop Limit).

   o  MaxHops, the maximum value of i used, (i=1,2,3,...MaxHops).

   o  T0, a time (start of measurement interval)

   o  Tf, a time (end of measurement interval)

   o  MP(address), Measurement Point at address, such as Src or Dst,
      usually at the same node stack layer as "address".

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                June 2020


   o  T, the Node time of a packet as measured at MP(Src), meaning
      Measurement Point at the Source.

   o  Ta, the Node time of a reply packet's *arrival* as measured at
      MP(Src), assigned to packets that arrive within a "reasonable"
      time (see parameter below).

   o  Tmax, a maximum waiting time for reply packets to return to the
      source, set sufficiently long to disambiguate packets with long
      delays from packets that are discarded (lost), such that the
      distribution of Round-Trip Delay is not truncated.

   o  F, the number of different flows simulated by the method and
      variant.

   o  flow, the stream of packets with the same n-tuple of designated
      header fields that (when held constant) result in identical
      treatment in a multi-path decision (such as the decision taken in
      load balancing).  Note: The IPv6 flow label MAY be included in the
      flow definition if the MP(Src) is a Tunnel End Point (TEP)
      complying with [RFC6438] guidelines.

   o  Type-P, the complete description of the packets for which this
      assessment applies (including the flow-defining fields).

3.3.  Metric Definitions

   This section defines the REQUIRED measurement components of the Route
   metrics (unless otherwise indicated):

   M, the total number of packets sent between T0 and Tf.

   N, the smallest value of i needed for a packet to be received at Dst
   (sent between T0 and Tf).

   Nmax, the largest value of i needed for a packet to be received at
   Dst (sent between T0 and Tf).  Nmax may be equal to N.

   Next define a *singleton* definition for a Hop on the path, with
   sufficient indexes to identify all Hops identified in a measurement
   interval.

   A Hop, designated h(i,j), the IP address and/or identity of
   Discoverable Nodes (or Cooperating Nodes) that are i hops away from
   the Node with address = Src and part of Route j during the
   measurement interval, T0 to Tf.  As defined here, a Hop singleton
   measurement MUST contain a Node Identity, hid(i,j), and MAY contain
   one or more of the following attributes:



Alvarez-Hamelin, et al. Expires December 20, 2020               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                June 2020


   o  a(i,j) Arrival Interface ID (e.g., when [RFC5837] is supported)

   o  d(i,j) Departure Interface ID (e.g., when [RFC5837] is supported)

   o  t(i,j) Arrival Timestamp (where t(i,j) is ideally supplied by the
      Hop, or approximated from the sending time of the packet that
      revealed the Hop)

   o  Measurements of Round-Trip Delay (for each packet that reveals the
      same Node Identity and flow attributes, then this attribute is
      computed, see next section)

   Node Identities and related information can be ordered by their
   distance from the Node with address Src in Hops h(i,j).  Based on
   this, two forms of Routes are distinguished:

   A Route Ensemble is defined as the combination of all routes
   traversed by different flows from the Node at Src address to the Node
   at Dst address.  A single Route traversed by a single flow
   (determined by an unambiguous tuple of addresses Src and Dst, and
   other identical flow criteria) is a member of the Route Ensemble and
   called a Member Route.

   Using h(i,j) and components and parameters, further define:

   When considering the set of Hops in the context of a single flow, a
   Member Route j is an ordered list {h(1,j), ... h(Nj, j)} where h(i-1,
   j) and h(i, j) are 1 hop away from each other and Nj satisfying
   h(Nj,j)=Dst is the minimum count of Hops needed by the packet on
   Member Route j to reach Dst. Member Routes must be unique.  The
   uniqueness property requires that any two Member routes j and k that
   are part of the same Route Ensemble differ either in terms of minimum
   hop count Nj and Nk to reach the destination Dst, or, in the case of
   identical hop count Nj=Nk, they have at least one distinct Hop:
   h(i,j) != h(i,k) for at least one i (i=1..Nj).

   All the optional information collected to describe a Member Route,
   such as the arrival interface, departure interface, and Round Trip
   Delay at each Hop, turns each list item into a rich structure.  There
   may be information on the links between Hops, possibly information on
   the routing (arrival interface and departure interface), an estimate
   of distance between Hops based on Round-Trip Delay measurements and
   calculations, and a time stamp indicating when all these additional
   details were valid.

   The Route Ensemble from Src to Dst, during the measurement interval
   T0 to Tf, is the aggregate of all m distinct Member Routes discovered

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                June 2020


   between the two Nodes with Src and Dst addresses.  More formally,
   with the Node having address Src omitted:

   Route Ensemble = {
   {h(1,1), h(2,1), h(3,1), ... h(N1,1)=Dst},
   {h(1,2), h(2,2), h(3,2),..., h(N2,2)=Dst},
   ...
   {h(1,m), h(2,m), h(3,m), ....h(Nm,m)=Dst}
   }


   where the following conditions apply: i <= Nj <= Nmax (j=1..m)

   Note that some h(i,j) may be empty (null) in the case that systems do
   not reply (not discoverable, or not cooperating).

   h(i-1,j) and h(i,j) are the Hops on the same Member Route one hop
   away from each other.

   Hop h(i,j) may be identical with h(k,l) for i!=k and j!=l ; which
   means there may be portions shared among different Member Routes
   (parts of Member Routes may overlap).

3.4.  Related Round-Trip Delay and Loss Definitions

   RTD(i,j,T) is defined as a singleton of the [RFC2681] Round-Trip
   Delay between the Node with address = Src and the Node at Hop h(i,j)
   at time T.

   RTL(i,j,T) is defined as a singleton of the [RFC6673] Round-trip Loss
   between the Node with address = Src and the Node at Hop h(i,j) at
   time T.

3.5.  Discussion

   Depending on the way that Node Identity is revealed, it may be
   difficult to determine parallel subpaths between the same pair of
   Nodes (i.e. multiple parallel links).  It is easier to detect
   parallel subpaths involving different Nodes.

   o  If a pair of discovered Nodes identify two different addresses,
      then they will appear to be different Nodes.

   o  If a pair of discovered Nodes identify two different IP addresses,
      and the IP addresses resolve to the same Node name (in the DNS),
      then they will appear to be the same Nodes.





Alvarez-Hamelin, et al. Expires December 20, 2020               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                June 2020


   o  If a discovered Node always replies using the same network
      address, regardless of the interface a packet arrives on, then
      multiple parallel links cannot be detected in that network domain.
      This condition may apply to traceroute-style methods, but may not
      apply to other hybrid methods based on In-situ Operations,
      Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM).

   o  If parallel links between routers are aggregated below the IP
      layer, then from Node point of view, all these links share the
      same pair of IP addresses.  The existence of these parallel links
      can't be detected at IP layer.  This applies to other network
      domains with layers below them, as well.  This condition may apply
      to traceroute-style methods, but may not apply to other hybrid
      methods based on IOAM.

   When a route assessment employs IP packets (for example), the reality
   of flow assignment to parallel subpaths involves layers above IP.
   Thus, the measured Route Ensemble is applicable to IP and higher
   layers (as described in the methodology's packet of Type-P and flow
   parameters).

3.6.  Reporting the Metric

   An Information Model and an XML Data Model for Storing Traceroute
   Measurements is available in [RFC5388].  The measured information at
   each hop includes four pieces of information: a one-dimensional hop
   index, Node symbolic address, Node IP address, and RTD for each
   response.

   The description of Hop information that may be collected according to
   this memo covers more dimensions, as defined in Section 3.3 above.
   For example, the Hop index is two-dimensional to capture the
   complexity of a Route Ensemble, and it contains corresponding Node
   identities at a minimum.  The models need to be expanded to include
   these features, as well as Arrival Interface ID, Departure Interface
   ID, and Arrival Timestamp, when available.  The original sending
   Timestamp from the Src Node anchors a particular measurement in time.

4.  Route Assessment Methodologies

   There are two classes of methods described in this section, active
   methods relying on the reaction to TTL or Hop Limit Exceeded
   condition to discover Nodes on a path, and Hybrid active-passive
   methods that involve direct interrogation of cooperating Nodes
   (usually within a single domain).  Description of these methods
   follow.

4.1.  Active Methodologies

   This section describes the method employed by current open source
   tools, thereby providing a practical framework for further advanced
   techniques to be included as method variants.  This method is
   applicable for use across multiple administrative domains.

   Internet routing is complex because it depends on the policies of
   thousands of Autonomous Systems (AS).  While most of the routers
   perform load balancing on flows using Equal Cost Multiple Path
   (ECMP), a few still divide the workload through packet-based
   techniques.  The former scenario is defined according to [RFC2991],
   while the latter generates a round-robin scheme to deliver every new
   outgoing packet.  ECMP uses a hashing function to ensure that every
   packet of a flow is delivered by the same path, and this avoids
   increasing the packet delay variation and possibly producing
   overwhelming packet reordering in TCP flows.

   Taking into account that Internet protocol was designed under the
   "end-to-end" principle, the IP payload and its header do not provide
   any information about the routes or path necessary to reach some
   destination.  For this reason, the popular tool traceroute was
   developed to gather the IP addresses of each hop along a path using
   the ICMP protocol [RFC0792].  Traceroute also measures RTD from each
   hop.  However, the growing complexity of the Internet makes it more
   challenging to develop an accurate traceroute implementation.  For
   instance, the early traceroute tools would be inaccurate in the
   current network, mainly because they were not designed to retain a
   flow state.  However, evolved traceroute tools, such as Paris-
   traceroute [PT] [MLB] and Scamper [SCAMPER], expect to encounter ECMP
   and achieve more accurate results when they do, where Scamper ensures
   traceroute packets will follow the same path in 98% of
   cases[SCAMPER].

   Today's traceroute tools send Type-P of packets, either ICMP, UDP, or
   TCP.  UDP and TCP are used when a particular characteristic needs to
   be verified, such as filtering or traffic shaping on specific ports
   (i.e., services).  [SCAMPER] supports IPv6 traceroute measurements,
   keeping the FlowLabel constant in all packets.

   Paris-traceroute allows its users to measure RTD in every hop of the
   path for a particular flow.  Furthermore, either Paris-traceroute or
   Scamper is capable of unveiling the many available paths between a
   source and destination (which are visible to this method).  This task
   is accomplished by repeating complete traceroute measurements with
   different flow parameters for each measurement; Paris-traceroute
   provides "exhaustive" mode while scamper provides "tracelb" (stands
   for traceroute load balance).  The Framework for IP Performance

   Metrics (IPPM) ([RFC2330] updated by [RFC7312]) has the flexibility
   to require that the Round-Trip Delay measurement [RFC2681] uses
   packets with the constraints to assure that all packets in a single
   measurement appear as the same flow.  This flexibility covers ICMP,
   UDP, and TCP.  The accompanying methodology of [RFC2681] needs to be
   expanded to report the sequential hop identifiers along with RTD
   measurements, but no new metric definition is needed.

   The advanced route assessment methods used in Paris-traceroute [PT]
   keep the critical fields constant for every packet to maintain the
   appearance of the same flow.  In IPv6, it is sufficient to be routed
   identically if the IP source and destination addresses and the
   FlowLabel are constant, see [RFC6437].  In IPv4, certain fields of
   the IP header and the first four bytes of the IP payload should
   remain constant in a flow.  In the IPv4 header, the IP source and
   destination addresses, protocol number, and Diffserv fields identify
   flows.  The first four payload bytes include the UDP and TCP ports,
   and the ICMP type, code, and checksum fields.

   Maintaining a constant ICMP checksum in IPv4 is most challenging, as
   the ICMP sequence number or identifier fields will usually change for
   different probes of the same path.  Probes should use arbitrary bytes
   in the ICMP data field to offset changes to sequence number and
   identifier, thus keeping the checksum constant.

   Finally, it is also essential to route the resulting ICMP Time
   Exceeded messages along a consistent path.  In IPv6, the fields above
   are sufficient.  In IPv4, the ICMP Time Exceeded message will contain
   the IP header and the first eight bytes of the IP payload, which
   affects its ICMP checksum.  The TCP sequence number, UDP Length, and
   UDP checksum will affect this value, and should remain constant.

   Formally, to maintain the same flow in the measurements to a
   particular hop, the Type-P-Route-Ensemble-Method-Variant packets
   should be[PT]:

   o  TCP case: For IPv4, the fields Src, Dst, port-Src, port_Dst,
      sequence number, and Diffserv Field SHOULD be the same.  For IPv6,
      the field FlowLabel, Src and Dst SHOULD be the same.

   o  UDP case: For IPv4, the fields Src, Dst, port-Src, port-Dst,
      Diffserv should be the same, and the UDP-checksum SHOULD change to
      keep the IP checksum of the ICMP time exceeded reply constant.
      Then, the data length should be fixed, and the data field is used
      to fixing it (consider that ICMP checksum uses its data field,
      which contains the original IP header plus 8 bytes of UDP, where
      TTL, IP identification, IP checksum, and UDP checksum changes).




Alvarez-Hamelin, et al. Expires December 20, 2020              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                June 2020


      For IPv6, the field FlowLabel, and Source and Destination
      addresses SHOULD be the same.

   o  ICMP case: For IPv4, the Data field SHOULD compensate variations
      on TTL or Hop Limit, IP identification, and IP checksum for every
      packet.  There is no need to consider ICMPv6 because only
      FlowLabel of IPv6 and Source and Destination addresses are used,
      and all of them SHOULD be constant.

   Then, the way to identify different hops and attempts of the same
   flow is:

   o  TCP case: The IP identification field.

   o  UDP case: The IP identification field.

   o  ICMP case: The IP identification field, and ICMP Sequence number.

4.1.1.  Temporal Composition for Route Metrics

   The Active Route Assessment Methods described above have the ability
   to discover portions of a path where ECMP load balancing is present,
   observed as two or more unique Member Routes having one or more
   distinct Hops which are part of the Route Ensemble.  Likewise,
   attempts to deliberately vary the flow characteristics to discover
   all Member Routes will reveal portions of the path which are flow-
   invariant.

   Section 9.2 of [RFC2330] describes Temporal Composition of metrics,
   and introduces the possibility of a relationship between earlier
   measurement results and the results for measurement at the current
   time (for a given metric).  There is value in establishing a Temporal
   Composition relationship for Route Metrics.  However, this
   relationship does not represent a forecast of future route conditions
   in any way.

   For Route Metric measurements, the value of Temporal Composition is
   to reduce the measurement iterations required with repeated
   measurements.  Reduced iterations are possible by inferring that
   current measurements using fixed and previously measured flow
   characteristics:

   o  will have many common hops with previous measurements.

   o  will have relatively time-stable results at the ingress and egress
      portions of the path when measured from user locations, as opposed
      to measurements of backbone networks and across inter-domain
      gateways.



Alvarez-Hamelin, et al. Expires December 20, 2020              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                June 2020


   o  may have greater potential for time-variation in path portions
      where ECMP load balancing is observed (because increasing or
      decreasing the pool of links changes the hash calculations).

   Optionally, measurement systems may take advantage of the inferences
   above when seeking to reduce measurement iterations, after exhaustive
   measurements indicate that the time-stable properties are present.
   Repetitive Active Route measurement systems:

   1.  SHOULD occasionally check path portions which have exhibited
       stable results over time, particularly ingress and egress
       portions of the path.

   2.  SHOULD continue testing portions of the path that have previously
       exhibited ECMP load balancing.

   3.  SHALL trigger re-assessment of the complete path and Route
       Ensemble, if any change in hops is observed for a specific (and
       previously tested) flow.

4.1.2.  Routing Class Identification

   There is an opportunity to apply the [RFC2330] notion of equal
   treatment for a class of packets, "...very useful to know if a given
   Internet component treats equally a class C of different types of
   packets", as it applies to Route measurements.  The notion of class C
   was examined further in [RFC8468] as it applied to load-balancing
   flows over parallel paths, which is the case we develop here.
   Knowledge of class C parameters (unrelated to address classes of the
   past) on a path potentially reduces the number of flows required for
   a given method to assess a Route Ensemble over time.

   First, recognize that each Member Route of a Route Ensemble will have
   a corresponding class C.  Class C can be discovered by testing with
   multiple flows, all of which traverse the unique set of hops that
   comprise a specific Member Route.

   Second, recognize that the different classes depend primarily on the
   hash functions used at each instance of ECMP load balancing on the
   path.

   Third, recognize the synergy with Temporal Composition methods
   (described above), where evaluation intends to discover time-stable
   portions of each Member Route, so that more emphasis can be placed on
   ECMP portions that also determine class C.

   The methods to assess the various class C characteristics benefit
   from the following measurement capabilities:



Alvarez-Hamelin, et al. Expires December 20, 2020              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                June 2020


   o  flows designed to determine which n-tuple header fields are
      considered by a given hash function and ECMP hop on the path, and
      which are not.  This operation immediately narrows the search
      space, where possible, and partially defines a class C.

   o  a priori knowledge of the possible types of hash functions in use
      also helps to design the flows for testing (major router vendors
      publish information about these hash functions, examples are here
      [LOAD_BALANCE].

   o  ability to direct the emphasis of current measurements on ECMP
      portions of the path, based on recent past measurement results
      (the Routing Class of some portions of the path is essentially
      "all packets").

4.1.3.  Intermediate Observation Point Route Measurement

   There are many examples where passive monitoring of a flow at an
   Observation Point within the network can detect unexpected Round Trip
   Delay or Delay Variation.  But how can the cause of the anomalous
   delay be investigated further --from the Observation Point --
   possibly located at an intermediate point on the path?

   In this case, knowledge that the flow of interest belongs to a
   specific Routing Class C will enable measurement of the route where
   anomalous delay has been observed.  Specifically, Round-Trip Delay
   assessment to each Hop on the path between the Observation Point and
   the Destination for the flow of interest may discover high or
   variable delay on a specific link and Hop combination.

   The determination of a Routing Class C which includes the flow of
   interest is as described in the section above, aided by computation
   of the relevant hash function output as the target.

4.2.  Hybrid Methodologies

   The Hybrid Type I methods provide an alternative method for Route
   Member assessment.  As mentioned in the Scope section,
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] provides a possible set of data fields that
   would support route identification.

   In general, nodes in the measured domain would be equipped with
   specific abilities:

   o  Store the identity of nodes that a packet has visited in header
      data fields, in the order the packet visited the nodes.





Alvarez-Hamelin, et al. Expires December 20, 2020              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                June 2020


   o  Support of a "Loopback" capability, where a copy of the packet is
      returned to the encapsulating node, and the packet is processed
      like any other IOAM packet on the return transfer.

   In addition to node identity, nodes may also identify the ingress and
   egress interfaces utilized by the tracing packet, the time of day
   when the packet was processed, and other generic data (as described
   in section 4 of [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data]).  Interface identification
   isn't necessarily limited to IP, i.e. different links in a bundle
   (LACP) could be identified.  Equally well, links without explicit IP
   addresses can be identified (like with unnumbered interfaces in an
   IGP deployment).

   Note that the Type-P packet specification for this method will likely
   be a partial specification, because most of the packet fields are
   determined by the user traffic.  The packet (encapsulation) header(s)
   added by the Hybrid method can certainly be specified in Type-P, in
   unpopulated form.

4.3.  Combining Different Methods

   In principle, there are advantages if the entity conducting Route
   measurements can utilize both forms of advanced methods (active and
   hybrid), and combine the results.  For example, if there are Nodes
   involved in the path that qualify as Cooperating Nodes, but not as
   Discoverable Nodes, then a more complete view of Hops on the path is
   possible when a hybrid method (or interrogation protocol) is applied
   and the results are combined with the active method results collected
   across all other domains.

   In order to combine the results of active and hybrid/interrogation
   methods, the network Nodes that are part of a domain supporting an
   interrogation protocol have the following attributes:

   1.  Nodes at the ingress to the domain SHOULD be both Discoverable
       and Cooperating, and SHOULD reveal the same Node Identity in
       response to both active and hybrid methods.

   2.  Any Nodes within the domain that are both Discoverable and
       Cooperating SHOULD reveal the same Node Identity in response to
       both active and hybrid methods.

   3.  Nodes at the egress to the domain SHOULD be both Discoverable and
       Cooperating, and SHOULD reveal the same Node Identity in response
       to both active and hybrid methods.






Alvarez-Hamelin, et al. Expires December 20, 2020              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                June 2020


   When Nodes follow these requirements, it becomes a simple matter to
   match single domain measurements with the overlapping results from a
   multidomain measurement.

   In practice, Internet users do not typically have the ability to
   utilize the OAM capabilities of networks that their packets traverse,
   so the results from a remote domain supporting an interrogation
   protocol would not normally be accessible.  However, a network
   operator could combine interrogation results from their access domain
   with other measurements revealing the path outside their domain.

5.  Background on Round-Trip Delay Measurement Goals

   The aim of this method is to use packet probes to unveil the paths
   between any two end-Nodes of the network.  Moreover, information
   derived from RTD measurements might be meaningful to identify:

   1.  Intercontinental submarine links

   2.  Satellite communications

   3.  Congestion

   4.  Inter-domain paths

   This categorization is widely accepted in the literature and among
   operators alike, and it can be trusted with empirical data and
   several sources as ground of truth (e.g., [RTTSub] ) but it is an
   inference measurement nonetheless [bdrmap][IDCong].

   The first two categories correspond to the physical distance
   dependency on Round-Trip Delay (RTD), the next one binds RTD with
   queueing delay on routers, and the last one helps to identify
   different ASes using traceroutes.  Due to the significant
   contribution of propagation delay in long-distance hops, RTD will be
   on the order of 100ms on transatlantic hops, depending on the
   geolocation of the vantage points.  Moreover, RTD is typically higher
   than 480ms when two hops are connected using geostationary satellite
   technology (i.e., their orbit is at 36000km).  Detecting congestion
   with latency implies deeper mathematical understanding since network
   traffic load is not stationary.  Nonetheless, as the first approach,
   a link seems to be congested if, after sending several traceroute
   probes, it is possible to detect congestion observing different
   statistics parameters (e.g., see [IDCong]).  Finally, to recognize
   distinctive ASes in the same traceroute path is challenging, because
   more data is needed, like AS relationships and RIR delegations among
   other (for more detail, please consult [bdrmap]).

6.  RTD Measurements Statistics

   Several articles have shown that network traffic presents a self-
   similar nature [SSNT] [MLRM] which is accountable for filling the
   queues of the routers.  Moreover, router queues are designed to
   handle traffic bursts, which is one of the most remarkable features
   of self-similarity.  Naturally, while queue length increases, the
   delay to traverse the queue increases as well and leads to an
   increase on RTD.  Due to traffic bursts generating short-term
   overflow on buffers (spiky patterns), every RTD only depicts the
   queueing status on the instant when that packet probe was in transit.
   For this reason, several RTD measurements during a time window could
   begin to describe the random behavior of latency.  Loss must also be
   accounted for in the methodology.

   To understand the ongoing process, examining the quartiles provides a
   non-parametric way of analysis.  Quartiles are defined by five
   values: minimum RTD (m), RTD value of the 25% of the Empirical
   Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) (Q1), the median value (Q2),
   the RTD value of the 75% of the ECDF (Q3) and the maximum RTD (M).
   Congestion can be inferred when RTD measurements are spread apart,
   and consequently, the Inter-Quartile Range (IQR), the distance
   between Q3 and Q1, increases its value.

   This procedure requires to compute quartile values "on the fly" using
   the algorithm presented in [P2].

   This procedure allows us to update the quartiles value whenever a new
   measurement arrives, which is radically different from classic
   methods of computing quartiles because they need to use the whole
   dataset to compute the values.  This way of calculus provides savings
   in memory and computing time.

   To sum up, the proposed measurement procedure consists of performing
   traceroutes several times to obtain samples of the RTD in every hop
   from a path, during a time window (W), and compute the quartiles for
   every hop.  This procedure could be done for a single Member Route
   flow, with parameter E set as False, or for every detected Route
   Ensemble flow (E=True).

   The identification of a specific Hop in traceroute is based on the IP
   origin address of the returned ICMP Time Exceeded packet, and on the
   distance identified by the value set in the TTL field inserted by
   traceroute.  As this specific Hop can be reached by different paths,
   also the IP source and destination addresses of the traceroute packet
   need to be recorded.  Finally, different return paths are
   distinguished by evaluating the ICMP Time Exceeded TTL (of the reply
   message): if this TTL is constant for different paths containing the



Alvarez-Hamelin, et al. Expires December 20, 2020              [Page 18]

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                June 2020


   same Hop, the return paths have the same distance.  Moreover, this
   distance can be estimated considering that the TTL value is normally
   initialized with values 64, 128, or 255.  The 5-tuple (origin IP,
   destination IP, reply IP, distance, response TTL) univocally
   identifies every measurement.

   This algorithm below runs in the origin of the traceroute.  It
   returns the Qs quartiles for every Hop and Alt (alternative paths
   because of balancing).  Notice that the "Alt" parameter condenses the
   parameters of the 5-tuple (origin IP, destination IP, reply IP,
   distance, response TTL), i.e., one for each possible combination.

   1  input:   W (window time of the measurement)
   2           i_t (time between two measurements)
   3           E (True: exhaustive, False: a single path)
   4           Dst (destination IP address)
   5  output:  Qs (quartiles for every Hop and Alt)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   6  T := start_timer(W)

   8  |       start_timer(i_t)

   10 |       for each Hop and Alt in RTD do:
   11 |       |     Qs[Dst,Hop,Alt] := ComputeQs(RTD(Hop,Alt))
   12 |       done
   13 |       wait until i_t timer is expired
   14 done
   15  return (Qs)
   ================================================================

   During the time W, lines 6 and 7 assure that the measurement loop is
   made.  Line 8 and 13 set a timer for each cycle of measurements.  A
   cycle comprises the traceroutes packets, considering every possible
   Hop and the alternatives paths in the Alt variable (ensured in lines
   9-12).  In line 9, the advance-traceroute could be either Paris-
   traceroute or Scamper, which will use the "exhaustive" mode or
   "tracelb" option if E is set True, respectively.  The procedure
   returns a list of tuples (m,Q1,Q2,Q3,M) for each intermediate hop, or
   "Alt" in as a function of the 5-tuple, in the path towards the Dst.
   Finally, lines 10 through 12 stores each measurement into the real-
   time quartiles computation.

   Notice there are cases where the even having a unique hop at distance
   h from the Src to Dst, the returning path could have several
   possibilities, yielding in different total paths.  In this situation,
   the algorithm will return more "Alt" for this particular hop.

7.  Conclusions

   This document introduces a method to perform statistical RTD
   measurements in a path, according to the actual state of the art
   regarding the traffic nature and the flow balance method in ECMP
   cases, which can help to tackle different performance situations in
   the network.  Some of these cases are enumerated in Section 5, while
   our method is proposed in Section 4, and the algorithm in Section 6.
   The importance of this algorithm is that it deals with the different
   topological aspects and the self-similar (i.e., not Poisson-
   distributed) nature of the traffic.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
   live paths are relevant here as well.  See [RFC4656] and [RFC5357].

   The active measurement process of "changing several fields to keep
   the checksum of different packets identical" does not require special
   security considerations because it is part of synthetic traffic
   generation, and is designed to have minimal to zero impact on network
   processing (to process the packets for ECMP).

   For applicable Hybrid methods, the security considerations
   in[I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] apply.

   When considering privacy of those involved in measurement or those
   whose traffic is measured, the sensitive information available to
   potential observers is greatly reduced when using active techniques
   which are within this scope of work.  Passive observations of user
   traffic for measurement purposes raise many privacy issues.  We refer
   the reader to the privacy considerations described in the Large Scale
   Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) Framework [RFC7594],
   which covers active and passive techniques.

11.  Appendix I MPLS Methods for Route Assessment

   A Node assessing an MPLS path must be part of the MPLS domain where
   the path is implemented.  When this condition is met, RFC 8029
   provides a powerful set of mechanisms to detect "correct operation of
   the data plane, as well as a mechanism to verify the data plane
   against the control plane" [RFC8029].

   MPLS routing is based on the presence of a Forwarding Equivalence
   Class (FEC) Stack in all visited Nodes.  Selecting one of several
   Equal Cost Multi Path (ECMP) is however based on information hidden
   deeper in the stack.  Early deployments may support a so called
   "Entropy label" for this purpose.  State of the art deployments base
   their choice of an ECMP member based on the IP addresses (see
   Section 2.4 of [RFC7325]).  Both methods allow load sharing
   information to be decoupled from routing information.  Thus, an MPLS
   traceroute is able to check how packets with a contiguous number of
   ECMP relevant addresses (and the same destination) are routed by a
   particular router.  The minimum number of MPLS paths traceable at a
   router should be 32.  Implementations supporting more paths are
   available.

   The MPLS echo request and reply messages offering this feature must
   support the Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV (was Downstream Mapping
   initially, but the latter has been deprecated).  The MPLS echo
   response includes the incoming interface where a router received the
   MPLS Echo request.  The MPLS Echo reply further informs which of the
   n addresses relevant for the load sharing decision results in a
   particular next hop interface and contains the next hop's interface
   address (if available).  This ensures that the next hop will receive
   a properly coded MPLS Echo request in the next step route of
   assessment.

   [RFC8403] explains how a central Path Monitoring System could be used
   to detect arbitrary MPLS paths between any routers within a single
   MPLS domain.  The combination of MPLS forwarding, Segment Routing and
   MPLS traceroute offers a simple architecture and a powerful mechanism
