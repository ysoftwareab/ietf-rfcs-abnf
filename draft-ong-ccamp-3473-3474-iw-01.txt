1. Abstract

   This document defines interworking procedures between [RFC 3473]
   (Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) RSVP-TE) and ITU-T Recommendation [G.7713.2].
   The ITU-T Recommendation uses codepoints allocated via associated
   RFCs [RFC 3474, RFC 3476].  Two basic interworking 
   scenarios are discussed. 

   G.7713.2 was intended to use the same basic mechanisms as and
   to be backwards compatible to RFC 3473 when using RFC 3473 as
   an Interior Network-Network Interface (I-NNI) protocol.  Some 
   objects are required to be carried transparently, but are 
   allocated codepoints from the range for transparent forwarding
   of unrecognized objects in accordance with existing RSVP.

   The mechanisms described in this document are applicable to
   any types of interfaces common to RFC 3473 and Recommendation 
   G.7713.2, esp. time-division multiplexed, lambda or
   fiber switching interfaces.

3. Introduction

   This document defines interworking procedures between [RFC 3473]
   (Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) RSVP-TE) and ITU-T Recommendation [G.7713.2].
   G.7713.2 codepoint allocation is documented in [RFC 3474] (GMPLS 
   RSVP-TE Usage and Extensions for ASON) signaling. The terms I-NNI 
   (Internal Network-Network Interface) and E-NNI (External Network-
   Network Interface) are taken from ITU-T Recommendation [G.8080]. 

   It should be noted that some interworking procedures described
   have been implemented by multiple parties, although further 
   interoperability testing may be needed.

3.1  ASON Model 

   It is impossible to understand the extensions defined in G.7713.2
   without also understanding the underlying ASON network model.  The
   ASON model allows a carrier network to consist of multiple domains,
   consistent with the architecture of transport networks defined in 
   ITU-T Recommendation G.805 [G.805].  Client devices may attach to
   the network at the User-Network Interface (UNI) reference point,
   while peer-level domains meet at the Network-Network Interface
   (NNI) reference point.

   Each transport layer is considered separately as a layer network.
   A layer network can be recursively partitioned into subnetworks,
   which partitioning is based on network policy.  Subnetworks are
   defined to be completely contained within higher level subnetworks.

   Transport networks typically do not have a single backbone, and
   regulatory concerns may affect the partitioning of the network and
   the routing of calls across the network.

   Each subnetwork or domain may utilize a different protocol or even
   different control architecture (e.g., one domain may use distributed
   control while another peer domain may use centralized control).  The
   control protocols used across the NNI reference point are required
   to be independent of the protocol used within the domains.

   Figure 1 shows an abstract representation of an ASON network model.

3.2  Use of Call vs. Connection Concept

   The ASON model employs the concept of a call to which zero or 
   more connections may be associated.  In signalling protocols, 
   it is useful to distinguish between attributes that are call 
   related versus connection related because connection handling 
   entities in the network generally do not have to understand or 
   deal with call objects.  The three new objects that RFC3474 and 
   RFC3476 introduce are all call objects.  Having distinguished 
   between call and connection objects, TLVs should be designed so
   that they do not mix call and connection objects.  This makes
   it easier for entities that only deal with connections as just
   mentioned.

3.3  Analysis of G.7713.2 Extensions to RFC 3473

   Given the requirements of ASON on call and connection control, 
   which are documented in more detail in ITU-T Recommendation G.7713
   [G.7713], a limited number of extensions were made to the base 
   RSVP-TE signaling defined in RFC 3473.  This section analyzes 
   the impact of these extensions.

3.3.1  Overall Extent of Changes

   Messages:  No new messages were defined in G.7713.2.  Use 
              of some messages was considered not necessary
              as discussed in section 3.3.2.

   Objects:   Two new objects are used in G.7713.2, the Gen_UNI
              object defined in the OIF UNI, and a Call_ID object.


L. Ong et al                                                           3


draft-ong-ccamp-3473-3474-iw-01.txt               February 2004



              In addition, the Call_OPS object is defined in an
              Appendix of G.7713.2.
              (3 out of approximately 20-25 objects used in GMPLS)

   C-Types:   New C-Types were added for UNI and ENNI Session,
              plus 5 new C-Types within G_UNI and 2 within Call_ID.
              (11 out of approximately 80 or so used in GMPLS)

   Procedures: The main changes to procedures was the elimination
              of ResvErr and ResvTear, discussed below in section
              3.3.2.

   New object and C-Type codepoints are allocated in [RFC 3474, 3476].

3.3.2  ResvTear/RevErr

   Concern has been raised as to whether a problem is introduced
   because the ResvTear and ResvErr messages are not used in
   G.7713.2 (sometimes called the "fatal flaw").  The procedures
   supported by ResvTear and ResvErr were felt to be inconsistent with the
   desired behavior of connection establishment in transport
   networks, as they result in a requirement for exchange of
   multiple messages in order to teardown the connection in 
   case of failure during connection setup.

   ResvTear and ResvErr allow the exchange of error information
   without teardown of the connection, however no case needing
   this function has been identified in the call/connection 
   control requirements for ASON [G.7713].   If such a case 
   is identified in the future the associated procedures can 
   be added as an extension to G.7713.2.

   It should be noted that no protocol violation occurs if a 
   ResvTear or ResvErr generates PathTear in the opposite 
   direction, as the protocol allows for this case.  In 
   particular, ResvTear and ResvErr can be used within a
   domain, so long as the interworking point at the edge of
   the domain supports the appropriate interworking behavior.

3.3.3  Use of Non-standard objects

   As discussed above, the new objects defined for G.7713.2 are
   the G_UNI, Call_OPS and Call_ID, all of which are transparent
   except at the terminating tunnel endpoint, based on the
   codepoint range assigned for the objects.

3.3.4  Duplication of standard objects/procedures

   As far as is known, the only duplication of procedures may 
   occur with SPC services, where RFC 3473 is not clear about
   support of specification of an egress label.  This issue is
   now being addressed via a supplementary document.

   However, the use of an SPC_Label subobject within the G_UNI
   object has some advantages over the use of the ERO for this
   purpose, esp. that ERO may not always be allowed across an
   administrative boundary, whereas G_UNI is carried transparently.
   As a result, use of an SPC_Label subobject may avoid some 
   error cases for the SPC service.  In addition, SPC_Label
   unambiguously identifies the type of service being supported
   for the call, whereas an egress label specification within 
   the ERO could be a result of either an originating UNI request
   or an SPC service request.

3.3.5  New Session objects

   Concern has been raised that the incorporation of new Session
   object C-Types for UNI and ENNI causes a backwards compatibility
   issue with RFC 3473.  Actually the reverse is true:  the use
   of specific C-Types for UNI and ENNI allow the receiving entity
   to unambiguously distinguish when signaling received is for a
   G.7713.2 UNI or ENNI interface.  Such signaling received at a
   RFC 3473 interface will be rejected due to the unrecognized 
   Session C-Type.

   When used as an I-NNI protocol, G.7713.2 uses the same Session
   object format and C-Type as RFC 3473 and functions in the same
   way, i.e., the Session object value is not changed as it
   traverses INNI reference points.

3.3.6  Terminology confusion

   Some terminology confusion has been suggested and should
   be clarified by further discussion.

3.3.7  Addressing

   Concern has been raised that the introduction of the TNA 
   subobjects in G_UNI will require every system to be able
   to process different types of addresses and address formats.






L. Ong et al                                                           5


draft-ong-ccamp-3473-3474-iw-01.txt               February 2004

   However, the TNA subobject, as a content of the G_UNI object,
   is only processed at tunnel endpoints, and the choice of
   address formats supported will be an option of the carrier.

   A similar situation occurs in IP with the understanding of
   exterior addresses. Only boundary nodes are required to 
   support routing based on such addresses, not all nodes.

   It was noted that Ipv6 includes a mechanism for support of
   NSAP format addresses.  This could potentially be used to
   eliminate one sub-type of the TNA, noting that this would not
   affect the actual processing of addresses required, only 
   the manner of carrying them.

3.3.8  SPC Services

   Discussed in section 3.2.4 above.

3.3.9  Session paradigm

   Concern has been raised that the use of the multi-session 
   approach to RSVP-TE connection control violates basic 
   paradigms of RSVP.  In the modeling of the Session object,
   ITU-T have treated this as a connection-related identifier.
   Using the separation of call and connection control, an end-
   to-end call consists of potentially multiple concatenated
   call segments.  In the same way, each call segment may have
   associated connection segments, hence the Session object 
   would contain the destination endpoint for that connection
   segment, rather than the call endpoint.

   While this may be incompatible with some implementations of 
   RSVP, the necessary information to identify a connection is
   still present using the combination of TNA and Session object.
   
   A possible mechanism to support implementations that rely
   solely on the Session object is to use a unique value of the
   extended tunnel ID within the Session object in order to
   distinguish between connection segments, as described in
   [RFC 3209].

3.3.10  Backwards Compatibility

    Concerns have been raised as to the backwards compatibility of
    G.7713.2 to RFC 3473.  It should first be pointed out that
    backwards compatibility to RFC 3473 was not a primary goal of the 
    work on ASON signaling, although it may be a more important goal 
    for work in IETF.  G.7713.2 I-NNI can be deployed in a network of
    nodes supporting RFC 3473 without requiring some interworking.
    However, G.7713.2 UNI or E-NNI deliberately cannot.

    This being said, G.7713.2 does support the three principles of
    backwards compatibility identified in [RSVP-ASON]:

    1) pre-ASON connections supported unchanged - this is true, as
       G.7713.2 is only used at the UNI or E-NNI boundaries for a
       domain relying on  RFC 3473 as its I-NNI.  

    2) transit switches do not need to be upgraded to support new
       functionality - this is true, as transit switches are only
       required to pass the G_UNI and Call_ID objects transparently,
       which will naturally occur based on the codepoint range.

    3) a message received at a non-capable switch will be rejected -
       for the UNI and ENNI interfaces this is true due to the use of
       distinct C-Types for UNI and ENNI Session objects.  Since these
       C-Types are not recognized by a switch that does not support a
       G.7713.2-based interface, the switch will reject the message,
       with no way to process the unrecognized Session object type.







4. Interworking Specifications

4.1  RFC 3473 to RFC 3474 Interworking

   The 3473-3474 interworking scenario occurs where a 3473 Overlay
   interface is supported by either an RFC 3474 network or
   a node with a 3473 Overlay interface is connected across
   multiple domains using RFC 3474 at the E-NNI.  This is shown
   in Figures 2 and 3.

              Figure 3: 3473-3474 Interworking Case 2


   These interworking cases may occur, for example, where
   networks supporting RFC 3474 internally or at the E-NNI
   interface to neighboring networks also support 3473 Overlay
   to an IP client system.

   
4.2 RFC 3474 to RFC 3473 Interworking


   The 3474-to-3473 interworking case is where a network using
   RFC 3473 internally supports RFC 3474 interfaces at its border
   nodes, as shown in Figure 4 below.  In this case, RFC 3474
   is supported across an RFC 3473 network or domain.

              Figure 4: 3474-to-3473 Interworking


   This may be a typical application, for example, if the client
   nodes A and C are not IP nodes or are identified by non-IP
   addresses.  RFC 3474 supports a client address (TNA) which is
   separate from the 3473 addressing range and can convey non-IP
   address formats such as NSAP.  It also allows full overlap of
   the client address range with the address range used in the
   network, since separate objects are used for each.

   The interworking point between 3474 and 3473 is required to 
   perform resolution of the TNA to the corresponding destination
   node in the 3473 network.

3.3 Mapping of General 3474 Capabilities

   RFC 3474 also identifies four specific requirements generating
   the extensions defined:

   a) support for call and connection separation
   b) support for soft permanent connection
   c) support for extended restart capabilities 
   d) additional error codes/values

   As RFC 3473 does not support call and connection separation
   or soft permanent connection, there are currently no additional 
   interworking requirements beyond transparent transport of
   related objects (see 5.4).  However, future study may be required 
   for support of features such as a call with no connections.

   (c) is a local procedure and has no interworking implications
   (d) is strictly a support item for the preceding requirements.

5. Procedures for 3473-3474 Interworking

5.1 Interworking of Session Object

   For RFC 3473, the Session Object contains the tunnel endpoint
   address, i.e., in Figure 2 the IP address of node C.  For RFC
   3474, which treats the tunnel as a concatenation of tunnels
   linking multiple domains and domain boundaries, the Session 
   Object contains the endpoint of the local tunnel, i.e., in
   Figure 2 the 3474 Session Object created by Node X would carry
   the address of Node Z as the local tunnel endpoint.

   For interworking purposes, the node receiving RFC 3473 RSVP
   must map the tunnel endpoint address of the Session Object 
   into the Destination TNA sub-object of the GENERALIZED_UNI 
   object that is defined in RFC 3476 and used in 3474, since this
   carries the end-to-end tunnel endpoint.  That ingress node
   then generates an appropriate RFC 3474 Session Object.

   At the egress RFC 3474 node, the RFC 3473 Session Object
   must be regenerated from the TNA and passed across the terminating 
   RFC 3473 interface to the destination client.

5.2  Interworking of Sender_Template

   For RFC 3473, the Sender_Template contains the tunnel sender,
   i.e., in Figure 2 the IP address of node A.  For RFC 3474, the
   Sender_Template contains the sender of the local tunnel, i.e.,
   in Figure 1 the address of Node X at the X-Y interface.

   For interworking purposes, the node receiving the RFC 3473
   message must map the Sender_Template address into the Source
   TNA sub-object of the GENERALIZED_UNI object from 3476, which
   carries the corresponding information in RFC 3474/3476.  

   At the egress interface, the egress node uses the Source TNA
   to regenerate the Sender_Template tunnel sender address.

5.3  Response Messages

   The inverse mapping is required for messages sent from the
   tunnel endpoint back to the tunnel source, before the 
   corresponding message is sent across the RFC 3473 interface
   to the end-to-end tunnel source. 

5.4  Other Objects

   RFC 3473 and RFC 3474.

6. Procedures for 3474-3473 Interworking

6.1  Addressing

   One significant difference between RFC 3474 and RFC 3473 is
   in the use of identifiers or address objects.  RFC 3474
   creates a separate client interface address using the TNA
   (Transport Network-Assigned Address), which is a globally
   unique identifier that may use Ipv4, Ipv6 or NSAP formats.
   
   It should be noted that a common application for RFC 3474 
   may be for the access of systems that do not support IP
   addressing. In this case, the end-to-end tunnel source/endpoint
   may use non-IP addresses that cannot be supported by RFC
   3473 objects.  RFC 3474-3473 interworking would get around
   this issue by carrying the actual tunnel source/endpoint
   identifiers in a separate object and using IP format identifiers
   within the 3473 domain.

6.2  Interworking of Session Object

   The ingress node (i.e., node X of Figure 3)
   maps the Destination TNA sub-object found in the received
   GENERALIZED_UNI object into the IP address of the local
   tunnel endpoint within the 3473 domain, i.e., node Z of
   Figure 4.  This is then used in the RFC 3473 Session object
   sent to other nodes within the 3473 domain.
   The GENERALIZED_UNI object is otherwise passed unchanged
   across the 3473 domain.  It is passed transparently at
   nodes that support RFC 3473 only.

   The egress RFC 3473 node (i.e., node Z of Figure 3)
   then uses the Destination TNA sub-object to determine
   the destination client interface.

6.3  Interworking of the Sender_Template

   The ingress node is itself the local
   tunnel source within the 3473 domain, and therefore puts
   its own IP address in the RFC 3473 Sender_Template object.

6.4  Other Objects

   Other objects may be received at the 3474/3473 interface,
   esp. the Call_ID and Call_OPS objects defined in RFC 3474.
   These are passed transparently across the 3473 domain.

7. Evolution Considerations

   If the additional requirements that generated RFC 3474 are 
   accepted to be requirements that 3473 networks must also
   support, interworking can be simplified by incorporating
   protocol extensions from RFC 3474 that provide needed
   functions, e.g., the Call_ID object, rather than attempting
   to duplicate these functions in alternative ways.

                           Appendix A
                Analysis of RFC 3474 Backwards Compatibility
   
Draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-ason-reqts-04.txt identifies three basic
requirements for backwards compatibility:

1)in a mixed network of nodes, it must be possible to set up 
conventional connections. Use of any extensions must not perturb 
existing conventional connections.  

2) when transit nodes are in the path of a call/connection, extensions 
must allow transit nodes to participate by passing information unmodified.  

3) when a transit node or egress node must support a new function but 
does not, extensions should be capable of being rejected in a way that 
is not detrimental to the network as a whole.   

The extensions defined in RFC 3474/ITU-T G.7713.2 satisfy the three
conditions as can be seen in the following:

A.1  Conventional Connections

In the model of RFC 3474/ITU G.7713.2, RFC 3474 may be used to support
an E-NNI interface or UNI interface to a network of RFC 3473 nodes.
Within the network of RFC 3473 nodes, conventional connections may
be set up without change.  Connections between a source RFC 3474
node and destination RFC 3474 node do not perturb existing connections.

Border nodes supporting an RFC 3474 E-NNI or UNI interface may continue
to support origination, termination or transit of connections between
RFC 3473 source and destination nodes as a matter of node implementation
and carrier deployment.

A.2  Transit Nodes

As discussed in the interworking procedures above, transit nodes are
not required to implement extensions in order to support connections
between RFC 3474 source and destination as the extension objects are
in the range that are passed transparently by transit nodes.

The extension objects defined in RFC 3474 are only processed at the
source and destination endpoints of a particular LSP tunnel.

A.3  Rejection

Signaling using G.7713.2/RFC 3474 will utilize the UNI or ENNI 
Session Object C-Type when used at the borders of a domain that
is strictly RFC 3473-based.  Signaling messages
received incorrectly at an RFC 3473 interface will be rejected
due to the Session object format being unrecognized.
