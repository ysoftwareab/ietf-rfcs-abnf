BGP Extension for Advertising In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (IFIT)
                              Capabilities
                draft-wang-idr-bgp-ifit-capabilities-02

Abstract

   This document defines extensions to BGP to advertise the In-situ Flow
   Information Telemetry (IFIT) capabilities.  Within an IFIT domain,
   IFIT-capability advertisement from the tail node to the head node
   assists the head node to determine whether a particular IFIT Option
   type can be encapsulated in data packets.  Such advertisement would
   be useful for mitigating the leakage threat and facilitating the
   deployment of IFIT measurements on a per-service and on-demand basis.

1.  Introduction

   In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (IFIT) denotes a family of flow-
   oriented on-path telemetry techniques, including In-situ OAM (IOAM)
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] and Alternate Marking [RFC8321].  It can
   provide flow information on the entire forwarding path on a per-
   packet basis in real time.

   IFIT is a solution focusing on network domains.  The "network domain"
   consists of a set of network devices or entities within a single
   administration.  One network domain MAY consists of multiple IFIT
   domain.  The family of emerging on-path flow telemetry techniques MAY
   be selectively or partially implemented in different vendors' devices

Internet-Draft           BGP for IFIT Capability           February 2021


   as an emerging feature for various use cases of application-aware
   network operations, in addition, for some usecases, the IFIT Features
   are deployed on a per-service and on-demand basis.  Within the IFIT
   domain, one or more IFIT-options are added into packet at the IFIT-
   enabled head node that is referred to as the IFIT encapsulating node.
   Then IFIT data fields MAY be updated by IFIT transit nodes that the
   packet traverses.  Finally, the data fields are removed at a device
   that is referred to as the IFIT decapsulating node.  Hence, a head
   node needs to know if the IFIT decapsulating node is able to support
   the IFIT capabilities.

   This document defines extensions to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to
   advertise the IFIT capabilities of a tail node to a head node in an
   IFIT domain.  Then the head node can learn the IFIT capabilities and
   determine whether a particular IFIT Option type can be encapsulated
   in traffic packets.  Such advertisement would be useful for avoiding
   IFIT data leaking from the IFIT domain and facilitating the
   deployment of IFIT measurements on a per-service and on-demand basis.

4.  Option 1: Extension to BGP Extended Community for IFIT-Capability
    Advertisement

4.1.  IPv4-Address-Specific IFIT Tail Community

   For IPv4 networks [RFC4360], this section defines a new type of BGP
   extended community called IPv4-Address-Specific IFIT Extended
   Community.  The IPv4-Address-Specific IFIT Tail Community can be used
   by the IFIT decapsulation node to notify the IFIT Capabilities to its
   parterner (as the IFIT encapsulation node).  It is a transitive
   extended community with type 0x01 and sub-type TBA1.

   The format of this extended community is shown in Figure 2.

       0                   1                   2                   3

      of the IFIT decapsulation node.  It is an IPv4 unicast address
      assigned by one of the Internet registries

   o  IFIT Capabilities: A 2 octets field. as defined in previous
      setion.

4.2.  IPv6-Address-Specific IFIT Tail Community

   For IPv6 networks [RFC5701], this section defines a new type of BGP
   extended community called IPv6-Address-Specific IFIT Extended
   Community.  The IPv6-Address-Specific IFIT Tail Community can be used
   by the IFIT decapsulation node to notify the IFIT Capabilities to its
   parterner (as the IFIT encapsulation node).  It is a transitive IPv6
   address specific extended community with type 0x00 and sub-type TBA2.

   The format of this extended community is shown in Figure 3.

      |Originating IPv6 Address(cont.)|     IFIT Capabilities         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

          Figure 3. IPv6-Address-Specific IFIT Tail Community

   o  Originating IPv6 Address field: A IPv6 address of the IFIT
      decapsulation node.  It is an IPv6 unicast address assigned by one
      of the Internet registries.

   o  IFIT Capabilities: as defined in previous setion.

   In this option, the Originating IP Address (inclue IPv4 and IPv6) in
   the extended community attribute is used as the IFIT decapsulation
   node.

5.  Option 2: Extension to BGP Next-Hop Capability for IFIT-Capability
    Advertisement

   The BGP Next-Hop Capability Attribute
   [I-D.ietf-idr-next-hop-capability] is a non-transitive BGP attribute,
   which is modified or deleted when the next-hop is changed, to reflect
   the capabilities of the new next-hop.  The attribute consists of a
   set of Next-Hop Capabilities.

   A IFIT Next-Hop Capability is a triple (Capability Code, Capability
   Length, Capability Value) aka a TLV:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Figure 4. BGP Next-Hop Capability

   o  Capability Code: a two-octets unsigned binary integer which
      indicates the type of "Next-Hop Capability" advertised and
      unambiguously identifies an individual capability.  This document
      defines a new Next-Hop Capability, which is called IFIT Next-Hop
      Capability.  The Capability Code is TBA3.

   o  Capability Length: a two-octets unsigned binary integer which
      indicates the length, in octets, of the Capability Value field.  A
      length of 0 indicates that no Capability Value field is present.

   o  IFIT Capabilities: as defined in previous setion.

   o  ORIG.  IP Address: An IPv4 or IPv6 Address of the IFIT
      decapsulation node.  It is an IPv4 or IPv6 unicast address
      assigned by one of the Internet registries.

   A BGP speaker S that sends an UPDATE with the BGP Next-Hop Capability
   Attribute MAY include the IFIT Next-Hop Capability.  The inclusion of
   the IFIT Next-Hop Capability with the NLRI advertised in the BGP
   UPDATE indicates that the BGP Next-Hop can act as the IFIT
   decapsulating node and it can process the specific IFIT encapsulation
   format indicated per the capability value.  This is applied for all
   routes indicated in the same NRLI.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to make the assignments for IPv4-Address-
   Specific IFIT Tail Community and IPv6-Address-Specific IFIT Tail
   Community:

   +-------+-------------------------------------------+---------------+
   | Value | Description                               | Reference     |

   This document defines extensions to BGP Extended Community and BGP
   Next-Hop Capability to advertise the IFIT capabilities.  It does not
