              Constrain Attribute announcement within BGP
            draft-ietf-idr-bgp-attribute-announcement-00.txt

Abstract

   [RFC4271] defines four different categories of BGP Path attributes.
   The different Path attribute categories can be identified by the
   attribute flag values.  These flags help identify if an attribute is
   optional or well-known, Transitive or non-Transitive, Partial, or of
   an Extended length type.  BGP attribute announcement depends on
   whether an attribute is a well-known or optional, and whether an
   attribute is a transitive or non-transitive.  BGP implementations
   MUST recognize all well-known attributes.  The well-known attributes
   are always Transitive.  It is not required for BGP implementations to
   recognise all the Optional attributes.  The Optional attributes could
   be Transitive or Non-Transitive.  BGP implementations MUST store and
   forward any Unknown Optional Transitive attributes and ignore and
   drop any Unknown Optional Non-Transitive attributes.

   Currently, there is no way to confine the scope of Path attributes
   within a given Autonomous System (AS) or a given BGP member-AS in
   Confederation.  This draft defines attribute extensions that help
   confine the scope of Optional attributes within a given AS or a given
   BGP member-AS in Confederation

Internet-Draft Constrain Attribute announcement within BGP     July 2016


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4271] defines four different categories of BGP Path attributes.
   The different Path attribute categories can be identified by the
   attribute flag values.  These flags help identify if an attribute is
   optional or well-known, Transitive or non-Transitive, Partial, or of
   an Extended length type.  BGP attribute announcement depends on
   whether an attribute is a well-known or optional, and whether an
   attribute is a transitive or non-transitive.  BGP implementations
   MUST recognize all well-known attributes.  The well-known attributes
   are always Transitive.  It is not required for BGP implementations to
   recognise all the Optional attributes.  The Optional attributes could
   be Transitive or Non-Transitive.  BGP implementations MUST store and
   forward any Unknown Optional Transitive attributes and ignore and
   drop any Unknown Optional Non-Transitive attributes.

   Optional Transitive attributes help foster partial deployments of
   newer BGP features.  Alternatively, Optional Non-Transitive
   attributes are drop by BGP speakers that do not recognise the
   attribute.  The optional attributes in their current definition do
   not provide any automated attribute level filtering to control the
   scope of announcements within a given AS or a BGP member-AS in
   Confederation.  Scoped announcements of attributes may be needed in
   certain scenarios.  Announcing attributes beyond their intended scope
   MAY result in breakage of functionalities or leaking of any undesired
   information.

   This draft defines new attribute extensions that help confine the
   scope of Path attributes; in particular Optional attributes within a
   given Autonomous System or a given BGP member-AS in confederation or
   a given Administrative domain.  Note that "BGP Member-AS in
   Confederation" and "Member-AS" are used entirely interchangeably
   thoughout this document.

   As part of new attribute extensions, this draft defines a new
   attribute format to incorporate the scoping information.  The new
   attribute format applies to all the new attribute types that will be
   defined moving forward.  The newly defined attribute scoping is
   specifically for newer attributes that explicitly state their use of
   such scoping bits.  These newly defined attributes would be either an
   Optional transitive attributes (recognized and unrecognized) or any
   recognized optional non-transtitive attributes.  For any well-known
   attributes or unrecognized optional non-transtive attributes, the
   standard rules mentioned in [RFC4271]  applies.

Internet-Draft Constrain Attribute announcement within BGP     July 2016


1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Path Attribute Format

   [RFC4271] defines path attribute format as a triple [attribute type,
   attribute length, attribute value] of a variable length.  The
   attribute value field is of a variable length.  This draft augments
   the path attribute value field and reserves first four bytes of path
   attribute value field as path attribute extended flags field.  All
   the path attributes carrying extended flags field will have a minumum
   attribute length of 4 bytes.  The augmented path attribute format
   applies to all the current undefined attributes types (30-39, 41-127,
   129-254).  Any attribute specific data follows the path attribute
   extended flags field.

3.  Extended Path Attribute Flags

   [RFC4271] defines four type of BGP Path attributes using the
   attribute Flags field as follows:

    Path Attribute flags:

                0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
               |O|T|P|E|   R   |   (R = MUST Be Zero)
               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


               O    Optional or a Well-known as defined in [RFC4271]

               T    Transitive or Non-Transtive as defined in [RFC4271]

               P    Partial as defined in [RFC4271]

               E    Extended Length type as defined in [RFC4271]


   This draft introduces new Flags field known as Extended Path
   Attribute Flags.  The Extended Path Attribute Flags field is defined
   as first 4 bytes of the Path Attribute's value field.  This draft
   introduces three new Extended Path Attributes flags as follows:

   Path Attribute flags:


        0               1               2               3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                        R                                  |C|A|
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       (R = MUST Be Zero)



              A    AS Wide Scope

              C    Member-AS in Confederation Scope

              M    Multi-AS Scope

   The first least significant bit ("A") is defined as the AS Wide Scope
   bit, which is used to indicate that an optional attribute cannot be
   announced outside a given AS boundary.  When set, the given optional
   attribute MUST be filtered by the sending BGP speaker at an AS
   boundary.  If the "A" bit is set then the "O" bit defined in BGP Path
   Attribute Flag field MUST be set.  Otherwise a BGP speaker MUST
   consider an attribute as an error and malformed.

   The second least significant bit ("C") is defined as the Member-AS
   Scope bit, which is used to indicate that an optional attribute
   cannot be announced outside a given Member-AS boundary.  When set,
   the given optional attribute MUST be filtered by the sending BGP
   speaker at a Member-AS boundary.  If the "C" bit is set then the "O"
   bit defined in BGP Path Attribute Flag field MUST be set.  Otherwise
   a BGP speaker MUST consider an attribute as an error and malformed.
   "C" bit SHOULD only be set when an Autonomous System is configured as
   a BGP Confederation.  A BGP speaker MUST not transmit an attribute
   with "C" bit set to peers that are not members of the local
   confederation.  Otherwise a BGP speaker MUST consider an attribute as
   an error and malformed.

   Both the first and the second most least significant bit together is
   defined as the Multiple AS Scope within a Single Administration.
   When both the first and the second bits are set, optional attribute
   can be traversed across multiple AS and filtered by the sending BGP
   speaker at the Administration boundary.

   The handling of malformed attributes SHOULD follow the procedures
   mentioned in [RFC7606].  For any malformed attribute that is handled

   by the "attribute discard" instead of the "treat-as-withdraw"
   approach, it is critical to consider the potential impact.  In
   particular, if the attribute has an impact on the route selection or
   installation process, then the presumption is that "attribute
   discard" is unsafe and "treat-as-withdraw" procedure SHOULD be
   considered.  Otherwise, "attribute discard" procedure SHOULD be used.

4.  Operation

   When originating a well-known Path attribute, a BGP speaker MUST set
   both the AS Wide Scope and Member-AS Scope bit to 0.  When
   originating an optional Path attribute, a BGP speaker SHOULD use and
   set AS Wide Scope bit if it wants to restrict the announcement within
   a AS.  Similarly, when originating an optional Path attribute, a BGP
   speaker SHOULD use and set Member-AS Scope bit if it wants to
   restrict the announcement with a Member-AS.  When originating an
   optional Path attribute, a BGP speaker SHOULD use and set both
   Member-AS Scope bit and AS Wide Scope bit if it wants to restrict the
   announcement within a single administration composed of multiple
   ASes.

   When a BGP speaker receives or originates a route that includes any
   well-known Path attribute with either a AS Wide Scope bit set or a
   Member-AS Scope bit set then it SHOULD consider the attribute as
   malformed.  The handling of malformed attributes SHOULD follow the
   procedures mentioned in [RFC7606].

   When a BGP speaker receives or originates a route that includes an
   optional Path attribute with a AS Wide Scope bit set and a Member-AS
   Scope bit cleared, it MUST remove that Path attribute when announcing
   the route to any of its EBGP speakers.  To deal with partial
   deployments it is suggested that a BGP speaker SHOULD quietly ignore
   and not pass along to other BGP peers any Path attribute received
   from its EBGP peers with a AS Wide Scope bit set and a Member-AS
   Scope bit cleared unless configured explicitly using a policy.

   When a BGP speaker receives or originates a route that includes an
   optional Path attribute with a Member-AS Scope bit set and a AS Wide
   Scope bit cleared, it MUST remove that Path attribute when announcing
   the route to any of its BGP speakers outside its Member-AS.  To deal
   with partial deployments it is suggested that a BGP speaker SHOULD
   quietly ignore and not pass along to other BGP peers any Path
   attribute received from its BGP peers with a Member-AS Scope bit set
   and a AS Wide Scope bit cleared unless configured explicitly as a
   policy.

   When a BGP speaker receives or originates a route with an optional
   path attribute that has both, the AS Wide Scope bit set and the

   Member-AS Scope bit set, it MUST announce it to all its EBGP peers
   within its administrative domain.  Such an attribute MUST be filtered
   when the attribute is announced outside its admistrative domain.  The
   BGP peering boundaries for an admistrative domain is a matter of a
   policy and is set by the operators.

   Any implementation that supports the extensions defined in this draft
   MUST support the Enhanced Error handling defined in [RFC7606].
   Enhanced Error handling allows any error condition that MAY occur
   during the parsing and processing of new attribute flags to be
   treated according to the procedures of [RFC7606].  Furthermore, it is
   assumed that the BGP network is enabled with Enhanced Error Handling
   feature.  This allows BGP speakers not implementing the draft
   extensions to apply the procedures of [RFC7606].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This draft define a new path attribute format for all undefined
   attribute types.  We request IANA to record the use of new path
   attribute format for the following undefined attribute types (30-39,
   41-127, 129-254).

   This draft defines two new Extended Path attribute flags.  We request
   IANA to create a new registry for BGP Extended Path Attribute Flags
   under BGP Path attributes as follows:

   Under "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" registry, "BGP
   Extended Path Attributes Flags" Reference: draft-keyupate-idr-bgp-
   attribute-annoucement-01 Registration Procedures as follows:

   Bit Value (LSB) Type                       Reference
         1         AS Wide Scope              Current Draft
         2         Member-AS in Confederation Current Draft

6.  Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
   inherent in the existing [RFC4724] and [RFC4271].
