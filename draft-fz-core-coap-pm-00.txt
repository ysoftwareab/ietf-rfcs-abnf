1.  Introduction

   [RFC7252] define the CoAP Protocol.  In CoAP Reliability is provided
   by marking a message as Confirmable (CON) with ACKs.  A message that
   does not require reliable transmission can be sent as a Non-
   confirmable message (NON).

   In case of CoAP reliable mode there are Message IDs and ACKs, that
   could eventually be used to measure Round-Trip Time (RTT) and losses.
   But it is resource-consuming for constrained nodes since they have to
   look at Message IDs and take timestamps.  These operations are
   expensive in terms of resources.  In case of CoAP unreliable mode,
   there is no ACK and, consequently, it is not possible to measure RTT
   and losses.

   Thus, there is no easy way to measure the performance metrics in COAP
   environment to satisfy the low resources of constrained nodes.  And
   it is in any case limited to RTT and end-to-end losses.

   [I-D.mdt-ippm-explicit-flow-measurements] reported a summary on the
   methodologies for Explicit Flow Measurement (EFM).  These EFM
   techniques could potentially be used in CoAP.  These methodologies
   employ few marking bits, inside the header of each packet, for loss

   and delay measurement.  These are relevant for encrypted protocols,
   e.g.  QUIC [RFC9000], where there are only few bits available in the
   non-encrypted header in order to allow passive performance metrics
   from an on-path observer.

   [I-D.mdt-ippm-explicit-flow-measurements] defines different
   combinations of bits because the number of bits in QUIC is limited
   and different experiments have been done.  But all these methods
   together imply complex algorithms that do not apply well to the CoAP
   environment.

   This document aims to create an easy way to allow performance
   measurement for CoAP, by defining a new option, called Performance
   Measurement (PM) CoAP Option.

2.  Performance Measurement methods for CoAP

   CoAP [RFC7252] defines a number of options that can be included in a
   message.  For this reason, a new option for CoAP, carrying
   Performance Measurement (PM) bits is the approach followed by this
   document.

   The PM bits that are included in the Option are:

   o  sQuare bit (Q bit), based on [RFC8321] and further described in
      [I-D.mdt-ippm-explicit-flow-measurements];

   o  Spin bit (S bit), described in [I-D.ietf-quic-manageability] and
      included as optional bit in [RFC9000];

   o  Loss and Delay event information for further usage.

   A requirement to enable PM methods in COAP environment is that the
   methodologies and the algorithm needs to be kept simple.  For this
   reason, the idea is to re-apply only the S bit and Q bit.

   The sQuare bit algorithm is to create square waves of a known length
   (e.g. 64 packets).  Each side of the connection can set the Q bit and
   toggle its value every fixed number of packets.  The number of
   packets can be easily recognized and packet loss can be measured.

   The Spin bit algorithm is to create a square wave signal on the data
   flow, using a bit, whose length is equal to RTT.  The Spin bit causes
   one bit to 'spin', generating one edge (a transition from 0 to 1 or
   from 1 to 0) once per end-to-end RTT.  The Spin bit is set by both
   sides to the same value for as long as one round trip lasts and then
   it toggles the value.

Internet-Draft                   COAP PM                    October 2021


   The synergy between S bit and Q bit is also possible.  As described
   above, the length of the Q bit square waves is fixed (e.g. a
   predefined number of packets) in this way each endpoint can detect a
   packet loss if it receives less packets than expected.  In addition,
   it is possible to potentiate the Q bit signal by incorporating RTT
   information as well.  This implies a little modification to the
   algorithm of the Q bit that could also be used alone:

      One packet in a period of the square wave can be selected and set
      to the opposite value of that period.  After one RTT it comes back
      and another packet is selected and set again to the opposite value
      of that period.  And the process can start again.  By measuring
      the distance between these special packets it is possible to
      measure the RTT in addition to packet loss.  The periods with the
      special packets have one packet less than expected but it is easy
      to recognize by both endpoints.

   So, with one bit, it can be possible to measure loss and delay.  This
   can be used to reinforce the Spin Bit mechanism or to use only one
   bit (sQuare bit) in the Option.

   The advantages of using the CoAP PM Option are:

      1) Simplification because it is not needed to read Message IDs,
      indeed there is a well-defined sQuare wave, and it is not
      necessary to store timestamps, since the duration of the Spin Bit
      period is equal to RTT.

      2) Enabling easy on-path observer (proxy, gateway) metrics.

3.  CoAP Performance Measurement Option

   Figure 1 shows the property of the CoAP Performance Measurement (PM)
   Option.  The formatting of this table is reported in [RFC7252].  The
   C, U, N, and R columns indicate the properties Critical, Unsafe,
   NoCacheKey, and Repeatable as defined in [RFC7252].  None of these
   properties is marked for the PM options.

       | Number | C | U | N | R | Name   | Format | Length | Default |

                    Figure 1: CoAP PM Option Properties

   Note that it could be possible to make use of one bit in the option
   to identify the mode.  In this way two patterns can be defined.

4.  Structure of the PM Option

   The value of the PM option is a 1 byte unsigned integer.  This
   integer value encodes the following fields:

                           0
                           0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                          |M|   Pattern   |
                          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

               Figure 2: CoAP Performance Measurement Option

   Where:

   o  M bit can be set to 1 or 0 and it is used to identify whether the
      Option follows pattern 1 (M bit = 0) or pattern 2 (M bit = 1).

   o  Pattern bits can be of two kinds as reported below.

   The PM Option can employ two patterns based on the value of the M
   bit:

                           0
                           0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                          |0|Q|   Event   |
                          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

          Figure 3: CoAP Performance Measurement Option pattern 1

                           0
                           0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                          |1|Q|S|  Event  |
                          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

          Figure 4: CoAP Performance Measurement Option pattern 2

   The COAP Option could be defined with 2 PM bits (S and Q) or defined
   with a single PM bit (Q bit).

   Where:

   o  Q bit is used in both pattern 1 and pattern 2.  It is described in
      [I-D.mdt-ippm-explicit-flow-measurements] and enhanced with the
      method described in Section 2;

Internet-Draft                   COAP PM                    October 2021


   o  S bit is used in Option 2.  It is also embedded in the QUIC
      Protocol [RFC9000];

   o  Event bits MAY encode additional Loss and Delay information based
      on well-defined encoding and they can also be used by on-path
      observers.

   The CoAP PM Options described in this document can be used in both
   requests and responses.  If a CoAP endpoint does not implement the
   measurement methodologies, it can simply leave the default value (all
   bits are zero).  In this way the other CoAP endpoints become aware
   that the measurement cannot be executed in that case.

   The fixed number of packets to create the Q bit signal is predefined
   and its value is configured from the beginning for all the CoAP
   endpoints.

5.  On-path Observers

   An on-path observer SHOULD be able to see deep into application and
   it can be a COAP Proxy or Gateway.  The on-path observers can read Q
   bit and S bit and apply the relevant algorithms to measure Losses and
   RTT.  Otherwise they can simply read the event bits and be informed
   about the performance without applying any algorithm.  The event
   signaling bits can be sent from the Server (that can do the
   performance measurement calculation) to the Client, or viceversa.

   As an example the Event bits can be divided into two parts: loss
   event bits and delay event bits.  Based on the average RTT, an end
   point can define different levels of thresholds and set the delay
   event bits accordingly.  The same applies to loss event bits.  In
   this way an on-path observer becomes aware of the network conditions
   by simply reading these Event bits.

   The on-path observer can read the event signaling bits and could be
   the Proxy or the Gateway which interconnects disjointed CoAP
   networks.  It MAY communicate with Client and Server to set some
   parameters such as timeout based on the network performance.

6.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations related to CoAP proxying are discussed in
   [RFC7252].

   A CoAP endpoint can use the CoAP PM Options to affect the measures of
   a network into which it is making requests by maliciously modifying
   the value of the option.  Also, the PM bits may reveal performance
   information outside the administrative domain.  To prevent that, a

   CoAP proxy that is located at the boundary of an administrative
   domain MAY be instructed to strip the payload or part of it before
   forwarding the message.

7.  IANA Considerations

   Numbers" sub-registry available at https://www.iana.org/assignments/
