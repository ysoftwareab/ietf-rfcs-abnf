                         draft-elkins-mentor-00

   Abstract

   The mentoring program was started by in 2013.  It has been continued
   in the original form to date.   The time has come to expand the
   program to better suit the needs of participants.  To this end, a
   survey was taken by IETF participants.  Results are analyzed here.  
   A number of new initiatives are also being proposed.

1 Background

   The mentoring program was started by Alissa Cooper and Brian Haberman
   in 2013.   It has been continued in the original form to date.   The
   time has come to expand the program to better suit the needs of
   participants.

1.1 Definition of Terms

   Mentor: An IETF participant who has been active in the IETF for a
   number of years and understands how the IETF process works.   The
   Mentor has the desire and the time to help newer participants to
   become more effective.   A Mentor will be willing to guide a number
   of individuals with the mentoring lasting for a length of 2 years. 
   The mentoring will be both at the meetings and remotely between
   meetings.  The number of individuals a mentor wishes to have is up to
   the mentor.

   Mentee: An IETF participant who wishes guidance on a specific task at
   the IETF or in the overall process and workings of the IETF by
   working with a more experienced IETF participant.   The Mentee may be
   a first time attendee, a relative newcomer (less than 3 years of
   involvement in the IETF), or wish mentoring on a specific task such
   as how to get an Internet Draft to progress to becoming a standard.

   Mentor Group:  The mentoring group, doing on-going mentoring,
   consists of the Mentor and his mentees.  Each mentee may be at a
   different stage in the process of becoming a full and active
   contributor to the IETF.

   Remote Mentor:  An experienced IETF participant who will mentor or
   answer questions via email, video conferencing or other electronic
   means.

   Regional Mentor: An experienced IETF participant who will mentor in a
   geographic region.

   Regional Mentoring Coordinator: An experienced IETF participant who
   will coordinate Regional Mentors.

   Institutional Mentor: An experienced IETF participant who will guide
   others at a corporation, educational institution or other grouping.  
   This type of mentor may wish to share his or her expertise and ways
   of mentoring with others.

   Task Mentor: An experienced IETF participant who will assist in a
   specific task such as how to get an Internet Draft passed.

INTERNET DRAFT              elkins-mentor-00          September 22, 2015


   Mentoring Event:  An event organized by the mentoring committee to
   bring Mentors and Mentees together.   This may be task-specific (ex.
   "How to get an Internet Draft passed", "How to build consensus") or
   for more general topics (ex. "How does the IETF work"). 

   Mentoring Committee: a group of IETF participants who coordinate the
   mentoring program.  

1.2 Current Mentoring Program Mission

   The goal of the IETF Mentoring Program is to match experienced IETF
   participants with newcomers in order to aid their integration into
   the IETF community through advice, help, and collected wisdom. The
   guidance provided by the mentors should speed up the time it takes
   for newcomers to become active, contributing members of the IETF.

   As the Mentoring Program develops, a charter (similar to the EDU Team
   Charter) needs to be created.

1.3 Current Mentoring Process 

   Currently, the Mentoring Program operates only at IETF meetings. If a
   Mentee signs up with enough advance notice (3 weeks or so before the
   conference), then the IETF Secretariat arranges for a web- based
   meeting between the Mentor and Mentee.

   Matching of mentor and mentees is currently done by volunteer
   coordinators, assisted by the IETF Secretariat. The tracking and
   assignments are based on a relatively crude system (i.e. XCel
   spreadsheet). Work is being done to create a set of web pages to
   assist in this area.

2 Mentoring Survey (2015)

   A survey was conducted in 2015 to help determine what changes should
   be made to the mentoring program.  The base results include who comes
   to the IETF, what they expect from it, and what kinds of information
   new attendees wish they had ready access to.  The survey is attached
   in Appendix 1.

2.1 Mentoring Program Experiences

2.1 Profile of Participants

   In total, there were 102 responses to the survey.   Some interesting
   points about the people who took the survey:

   - 2/3rd of the people are working on an active draft
 


Elkins                   Expires March 25, 2016                 [Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT              elkins-mentor-00          September 22, 2015


   - 1/3rd were from academia (students or professors) 
   - a little over 30% were network operators
   - about 8% were working on public policy

   The answers were not mutually exclusive, so the total does not need
   to add up to 100%.   

   Our first question was whether this survey is an accurate reflection
   of the IETF membership, thus making the results useful.  The authors
   tend to think that it is unlikely that 2/3 of the attendees of the
   IETF in general are actively involved in a draft, so it seems that
   the survey responders are biased towards the most active members of
   the IETF.  

   After consideration, this seems unsurprising.   If one looks at the
   psychology of survey takers (with no reward at the end of the
   survey), it is likely that the population is disproportionately
   biased towards either the most engaged members or those who have a
   comment either positive or negative.  Having the mentoring program
   serve the needs of the people who are most engaged, thus most likely
   to create great RFCs seems a worthwhile effort.

   When asked how many IETFs they had attended, more than half of the
   people had attended over 4 IETF live meetings. A fifth of respondents
   had attended between 2-4 IETFs and a quarter of respondents were
   attending their first IETF.

   Again, this may be biased towards the more engaged participants.  But
   since approximately 25% of the survey takers are newcomers and the
   current mentoring program only targets newcomers, one would have some
   trust in the results of the comments on the Mentee experience.   Of
   course, there appeared to be some confusion about which mentoring
   program was being commented on - the IETF mentoring program or the
   ISOC mentoring program, but we suspect that the survey results were
   not completely invalidated by this slight confusion.

2.2 Why People Attend IETF

   This question is important because the authors wish to design a
   mentoring program that suits the needs of the participants.

   70% want to make progress on an active draft
   82% want to contribute to a draft or other work
   80% want to learn about activity in networks or protocols

   This is interesting because many people do not just want to make
   progress on their own efforts but want to be active contributors to
   the efforts of others.  This reinforces the "community" aspect of
 


Elkins                   Expires March 25, 2016                 [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT              elkins-mentor-00          September 22, 2015


   IETF.  It takes a long time to create a great new standard and
   requires active participation from many other engaged members.

2.3 Mentee Experience

   More than 85% of the Mentees who responded expressed that they felt
   the mentoring process helped them in some way in helping them to
   achieve their overall objective of attending the IETF.  This
   indicates that the Mentees benefit from having someone more
   knowledgeable with the IETF to guide them in the beginning.  

   Having said that, slightly less than 50% of the Mentees said that the
   program helped them "a lot" or "more than expected".   This would
   indicate to us that restructuring the program and offering more
   alternatives may meet the needs of the participants.

2.4 Mentor Experience

   The current program appeared to be viewed more favorably by Mentors
   than Mentees. Many also saw it as a way of giving back to the
   community. A bit over 65% if the Mentors expressed they that they had
   an average, good or very good experience with the mentorship
   program.

   A number of comments were made towards improving the mentorship
   program which have helped in the drafting of this document.  

3 Structure of the Mentoring Program

3.1 What People Want from the Program

   Expectations for the Mentoring Program vary.  Some mentees will want
   a short relationship, just to get them started; some will want a
   longer relationship, in order to get thoroughly integrated into the
   IETF.  Some mentees merely want technical help on IETF processes;
   some want cultural guidance.  The kind of mentoring offered should be
   specified when a mentor signs up for the program.  Mentees should
   also be asked about their needs/expectations when they sign up. 

3.2 Different Ways of Mentoring

   To help IETF participants achieve the ultimate goal of full, active
   participation in the IETF process for creating new standards, we need
   to have multiple ways of mentoring available.  As the program
   evolves, we will undoubtedly find more ways to mentor.

   As the core goal of the IETF is to develop effective standards, the
   goal of the mentoring program should be to help participants in the
 


Elkins                   Expires March 25, 2016                 [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT              elkins-mentor-00          September 22, 2015


   sometimes arcane process of passing standards.  But the program
   should also help Mentees to become good and active participants. 

   So, we propose the following types of mentoring:

   1.  Classic mentoring
   2.  One time event or workshop
   3.  Regional / institutional mentoring
   4.  Task mentoring
   5.  Ongoing mentoring
   6.  Shadow mentoring
   7.  Speed mentoring

3.3 Classic Mentoring

   Retain the current option of having a pre-meeting conference call,
   followed by one-on-one, face-to-face meetings of Mentor and Mentee
   on-site at a single IETF meeting.

3.4 One Time Event or Workshop

   In addition to the "classic" Mentor, have a small group (10 or so)
   which meets at the IETF and also maybe remotely to discuss specific
   topics of general interest.  These differ from Task Mentoring efforts
   in being a one-time effort.  If the topic is of recurring interest,
   it may become a Task Mentoring topic.

   Format can be: 30 minutes presentation, 15 minutes group discussion,
   15 minutes one-on-one time with an AD / WG chair.   (5 or so WG
   chairs and ADs will be needed to support this.)

   This may be done in conjunction with the Newcomer's Tutorial.   

3.5 Regional / Institutional Mentoring

   Often mentoring has cultural components.  This option allows mentees
   to learn how the culture of IETF relates to their own regional or
   institutional culture.  A Regional or Institutional Mentor who is
   familiar with the regional or institutional culture will work with
   mentees.  The goal is to help them learn about the IETF and how it
   works, both formally and informally.

3.6 Task Mentoring 

   IETF involves various specific undertakings on a recurring basis. 
   Events (and/or videos) will be offered, both at the IETF and
   remotely, which discuss specifics on topics such as "How to get an
   RFC passed" (Scott Bradner will have PPTs and videos for this).  Task
 


Elkins                   Expires March 25, 2016                 [Page 8]

INTERNET DRAFT              elkins-mentor-00          September 22, 2015


   Mentors will create and present materials on these tasks as they are
   identified, and will work with mentees who need assistance on
   accomplishing them.

3.7 Ongoing Mentoring

   This option is for people who want longer-term mentoring. For many
   attendees, it may take a number of years for newcomers to feel
   comfortable in the IETF environment and to develop their own network
   of contacts.

   Both mentor and mentees make a commitment to work together for up to
   3 IETFs.  At each meeting, the mentor and his mentees meet.  If the
   mentor takes on a new mentee, then the group can meet together.  This
   will help create a network for new people.

3.8 Shadow Mentoring 

   Sometimes the best way to learn how something works is to watch
   someone who knows how go through the process.  Shadow Mentoring
   involves having the mentee shadow the mentor -- spend a week (or a
   day) at IETF following him / her around, attending the same sessions
   and meeting, etc.  

   A Shadow Mentor may devote one entire day to the Mentee.   A
   prospective Shadow Mentor would have a breakfast meeting with the
   Mentee to explain the day's schedule, then as the day proceeds, he /
   she would explain why they are at each session (presumably, it is
   pertinent to either their work at the IETF or of interest otherwise),
   go to lunch (and optionally dinner) with the Mentee, and then have a
   feeback session together at the end of the day.  Of course, if
   shadowing is not working out for a particular pair, for whatever
   reason, the Mentee / Mentor can come to the Mentoring Committee and
   ask for reassignment.

3.9 Speed Mentoring

   This would be similar to Speed Dating.  That is, we have a session
   with ten experienced IETFers (Mentors) and the same number of
   Mentees.   Each Mentee / Mentor pair talks to each other for 5
   minutes.  This event will be moderated by the Mentoring Committee.

   The advantage of this approach is that it is a limited time
   commitment for the Mentor as well as a way for the Mentee to meet
   quite a few people in a short amount of time thus building their
   network and getting multiple perspectives.

4 Selection of Mentor / Mentee

4.1 Who Should be a Mentor?

   Mentors should have been active in the IETF for long enough to be
   familiar with the organization and how it works.  They should also
   have developed a network of contacts within the organization, so that
   they can make their mentees familiar with how to build their own
   networks.  And they should understand the process by which RFCs are
   written and adopted or how new work is introduced to the IETF.

   Mentor volunteers should be aware that at times there will not be
   enough mentees to go around.  Failure to be assigned a mentee is a
   reflection of low demand, not a reflection on the mentor volunteer.
   Of course, as the program gains in popularity, there may not be
   enough mentors also.   With time and innovation, we hope to achieve
   steady state.

4.2 Types of Mentors

   A mentor may sign up to be:

   1.  A Task Mentor
   2.  Regional / Institutional Mentor: (The regional mentor coordinator
       will be chosen from this group.) 
   3.  Remote Mentor
   4.  Classic Mentor
   5.  Shadow Mentor
   6.  Ongoing Mentor
   7.  Speed Mentor

   Clearly, a different set of time commitments is involved in each. 

   A mentee would not sign up for a mentor type directly, but would go
   through a series of questions on their needs (See section on Matching
   Mentor and Mentee).

4.2 Who Should be a Mentee?

   Mentees can range from first-time attendees to relative newcomers to
   the process (those who have been involved for less than three years).
   Each mentee may have different needs.  The Mentor Program will
   attempt to match mentee needs to mentor expertise.

   After spending some time as a Mentee, the individual may wish to
   become a part of the Mentoring Committee as a way to give back to the
   community for having mentored them.    They may also wish to provide
   feedback to the community.

4.3 How to Match Mentor and Mentee
 


Elkins                   Expires March 25, 2016                [Page 10]

INTERNET DRAFT              elkins-mentor-00          September 22, 2015


   A Mentors DB will be constructed which tracks who has volunteered to
   be a mentor, what kind of mentoring they can do, and who (and how
   many) Mentees they have at any given time.  An online tool will be
   developed to ask Mentees what kind of mentoring they want (among the
   options that they have) as well as for Mentors to be able to indicate
   how they can help (among the options they have).  

   The tool will walk the would-be Mentee through a structured set of
   queries to determine his particular needs and desires.  It will also
   guide a Mentor volunteer thru a structured set of queries to
   determine his expertise and interests.  The data will then be used to
   match each Mentee with the optimum Mentor and type of program.

5 Where / When / How to Mentor 

5.1 Remote participation

   The best way for mentoring can be considered face-to-face meetings,
   as they can help build trust and understanding between Mentor and
   Mentee. The face-to-face meetings can also inspire and create a sense
   of collaboration towards the common goal, "making the Internet work
   better" [RFC3935]. 

   However, in some cases attending an IETF meeting is prohibitive to
   individuals which have the knowledge and motivation to contribute,
   but lack the resources or capacity to attend. In this context, remote
   participation can be a suitable alternative. If remote participation
   is required, the mentoring process should involve pre-arranged
   conference calls or email exchanges. 

   In some cases, remote participation can be organized as a group
   event. For this situations, Regional Mentors can be assigned if there
   is a pool of available volunteers in that region. In this context,
   the Regional Mentors can organize on-site mentoring sessions for
   multiple Mentees, of course to the best of their availability.  


5.2 When to Mentor

   In many cases, participants in the mentoring program sign-up for the
   mentoring program before the IETF meeting.  In this cases, the
   mentoring program coordinators match-up Mentor and Mentee and
   introduce the two to one another over the e-mail. Following the e-
   mail introduction and considering the Mentor and Mentee's
   availability, at least one remote or face-to-face meeting is
   recommended prior to the IETF meeting. This can be a good opportunity
   for the Mentee to discuss his interests and expectations related to
   the IETF meeting.

   However, some of the mentor program participants sign-up on the first
   day of the IETF meeting. In this instance, depending on the mentor's
   schedule, the short introductory meeting is recommended before the
   Newcomers' Meet and Greet. 

   One of the major opportunities for the Mentees is the Newcomers' Meet
   and Greet session, which is open only to Newcomers, WG chairs and
   Mentors. To take advantage of this opportunity, it would be essential
   for the Mentor to participate and introduce the Mentee to the WG
   chairs according to the Mentee's area of interest.    

   Another good opportunity for the Mentee to be introduced and
   socialize with other experts in his field of interest, is the Welcome
   reception. To the best of his availability, The Mentor is recommended
   to attend and support the Mentee in this attempt. 

   Follow-up meetings throughout the week are also recommended.
   Sometimes, the IETF sessions can prove confusing and overwhelming for
   a newcomer. This type of interim mentoring session should help the
   Mentee better understand how to navigate through the sessions, and
   potentially become an active contributor.

   In the case of remote participants, or Regional Mentors, the
   Mentoring Process could be composed as well from:

   - a short introductory meeting prior to the IETF  
   - a meeting to discuss the Mentee's recommended sessions
   - follow-up meetings throughout the week  

5.3 Time Constraints

   Mentors are active contributors in the IETF and in most cases have
   very busy schedules. To that end, the mentoring session should be
   scheduled and agreed upon prior to the IETF meeting. If that is not
   possible, the mentoring schedule should be decided as early as
   possible. The Mentees need to understand that Mentoring is a
   volunteer-based activity and be considerate with the Mentor's time.

   Taking into account the many responsibilities of the IETF members
   with leadership positions (e.g. ADs), these members should be
   considered as part of the Mentor's DB only in extraordinary
   circumstances.

   A Classic Mentor should plan on about 3-4 hours before an IETF
   meeting and about 5-6 hours during the IETF week. We can expect
   mentees to meet mentors at least 3-4 times during the IETF week. The
   schedule can be decided mutually based on the mentee and mentors
   schedules and commitments.

5.4 How to Mentor

   How to mentor should be dictated by the Mentee's expectations for the
   IETF meeting. However, the social interaction with other contributing
   members of the IETF community is essential to a newcomer. It can help
   build the sense of belonging to the community and facilitate the
   transition from newcomer to contributor. To that end, as much as
   possible, the Mentor should support the Mentee in meeting members in
   leadership positions (e.g. ADs, WG chairs) and other contributors in
   the Mentee's area of interest.     

   The Mentor can also help the Mentee choose the area and WGs most
   suitable for his interest and recommend sessions throughout the week.
   Recommending a list of relevant documents for the Mentee's area of
   interest would be a welcome addition.  Given its off-site nature,
   remote mentoring is mostly limited to the later type of activities.

6 Publicity

   Comments were made on better publicizing the mentoring program.  The
   authors are working to do this. 

7 Measuring Effectiveness

   At its core, the Mentoring process is a subjective experience. That
   being the case, a qualitative analysis seems to be the most
   appropriate solution for measuring the effectiveness of the Mentoring
   program.

   To that end, a survey was proposed and data was collected. The survey
   and analysis are presented in Section 2. Question 3 of the survey
   covers the level of satisfaction of the Mentee with the Mentoring
   program, while Question 4 is targeting the Mentors' experience.

   Other metrics may be employed to measure the effectiveness of the
   Mentoring program on the long run. One example is the number of RFC
   documents published on average by former Mentees. It is, however,
   hard to isolate the contribution of the Mentoring program in this
   complex context. Hence, this type of data can be misleading. 

   As a long time participant (with much experience in performance
   metrics) noted: "Not everything that can be measured, counts.   And
   not everything that counts, can be measured."

   Having said that, we will continue our efforts to attempt to measure
   the success of the revised mentoring process by conducting additional
   surveys from time to time.  For Mentees, specifically, a breakfast
   meeting will be held to obtain comments and feedback on mentoring at

   that IETF.  Additionally, a web page will be created to solicit
   feedback from Mentees and Mentors. This will also serve the needs of
   participants in remote and regional mentoring.
