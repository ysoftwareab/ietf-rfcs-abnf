      Discovery of OSCORE groups with the CoRE Resource Directory
                 draft-tiloca-core-oscore-discovery-00

Abstract

   Group communication over the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
   can be secured by means of Object Security for Constrained RESTful
   Environments (OSCORE).  At deployment time, devices may not know the
   exact OSCORE groups to join, the respective Group Manager, or other
   information required to perform the joining process.  This document
   describes how CoAP endpoints can use the CoRE Resource Directory to
   discover OSCORE groups and acquire information to join them through
   their respective Group Manager.  This approach is consistent with,
   but not limited to, the joining of OSCORE groups based on the ACE
   framework for Authentication and Authorization.

1.  Introduction

   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] supports group
   communication over IP multicast [RFC7390] to improve efficiency and
   latency of communication and reduce bandwidth requirements.  The
   method Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)
   [I-D.ietf-core-object-security] enables end-to-end security of CoAP
   payload and options through CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)
   [RFC8152].  In addition, [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm] specifies
   how OSCORE protects CoAP messages in group communication contexts.

   A CoAP endpoint joins an OSCORE group by interacting with the
   responsible Group Manager (GM) to get the required keying material.
   As described in [I-D.tiloca-ace-oscoap-joining], the joining process
   can be based on the ACE framework for Authentication and
   Authorization in constrained environments [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz],
   with the joining endpoint and the GM as ACE Client and ACE Resource
   Server, respectively.  That is, the joining endpoint accesses the
   join resource associated to the OSCORE group of interest and exported
   by the GM.

Internet-Draft   OSCORE group discovery with the CoRE RD    October 2018


   Devices are typically equipped with a static Manufacturer Identity
   installed at manufacturing time.  This identity is used at deployment
   time during an enrollment process which provides the device with an
   Operational Identity, possibly updated during the device lifetime.
   In the presence of secure group communication for CoAP, such an
   Operational Identity should also comprise information required for
   the device to join OSCORE groups.  This especially includes a
   reference to the join resources to access at the respective GMs.

   However, it can be infeasible or inconvenient to provide such precise
   information to freshly deployed devices as part of their (early)
   Operational Identity.  This can be due to a number of reasons: the
   Manufacturer Identity has to be minimal and as small as possible in
   size; the OSCORE group(s) to join and the responsible GM(s) are
   unknown at manufacturing time; an OSCORE group of interest is
   created, or the responsible GM is deployed, only after the device is
   enrolled and fully operative in the network; information related to
   existing OSCORE groups or their GMs has been changed.  This requires
   a method for CoAP endpoints to dynamically discover OSCORE groups and
   their GM, and to retrieve updated information about those groups.

   This specification describes how CoAP endpoints use the CoRE Resource
   Directory (RD) [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory] for discovering an
   OSCORE group and retrieving the information required to join that
   group through the responsible GM.  In principle, the GM registers as
   an endpoint with the RD.  The corresponding registration resource
   includes one link for each OSCORE group under that GM, specifying the
   path to the related join resource.  More information about the OSCORE
   group is stored in the target attributes of the respective link.

   When querying the RD for OSCORE groups, a CoAP endpoint can further
   benefit of observation [RFC7641].  This enables convenient
   notifications about the creation of new OSCORE groups or the updates
   of information concerning existing ones.  As a consequence, it
   facilitates the early deployment of CoAP endpoints, i.e. even before
   the GM is deployed and the OSCORE groups of interest are created.

   The approach described in this specification is consistent with,
   although not limited to, the joining of OSCORE groups described in
   [I-D.tiloca-ace-oscoap-joining].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

Internet-Draft   OSCORE group discovery with the CoRE RD    October 2018


   This specification requires readers to be familiar with the terms and
   concepts discussed in [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory] and
   [RFC6690].  Readers should also be familiar with the terms and
   concepts discussed in [RFC7252], [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm] and
   [I-D.tiloca-ace-oscoap-joining].

   Terminology for constrained environments, such as "constrained
   device", "constrained-node network", is defined in [RFC7228].

   This document refers also to the following terminology.

   o  Zeroed-epoch Group ID: this refers to the Group ID of an OSCORE
      group as stored in the RD.  The structure of such a stored Group
      ID is as per Appendix C of [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm], with
      the "Group Epoch" immutable and set to zero.

2.  Registration Resource for Group Managers

   With reference to Figure 4 of [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory], a
   Group Manager (GM) registers as an endpoint with the CoRE Resource
   Directory (RD).  The registration includes the links to the join
   resources at the GM, associated to the OSCORE groups under that GM.

   In particular, each link to a join resource includes:

   o  "target": URI of the join resource at the GM.

   o  target attributes, including:

      *  Resource Type (rt) with the value "core.osc.j" defined in
         Section 7.1 of this specification.

      *  The zeroed-epoch Group ID of the OSCORE group.

      *  One target attribute for each multicast IP address associated
         to the OSCORE group.

3.  Registration of Group Manager Endpoints

   Upon deployment, a GM finds the RD as described in Section 4 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory].  After that, a GM registers as an
   endpoint with the RD, as described in Section 5.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory].  When doing so, the GM MUST also
   register all the join resources it is exporting at that point in
   time, i.e. one for each of its OSCORE groups.  The GM SHOULD NOT use
   the Simple Registration approach described in Section 5.3.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory].

   The example below shows a GM with endpoint name "gm1" and address
   2001:db8::ab that registers with the RD.  The GM specifies the link
   to one join resource for accessing the OSCORE group with zeroed-epoch
   Group ID "feedca570000" and one associated multicast IP address
   ff35:30:2001:db8::23.

   Interaction: GM -> RD

   Req: POST coap://rd.example.com/rd?ep=gm1
   Content-Format: 40
   Payload:

   Interaction: RD -> GM

   Res: 2.01 Created
   Location-Path: /rd/4521

4.  Addition and Update of OSCORE Groups

   The GM is responsible to keep its registration with the RD up to date
   with links to all its join resources.  This means that the GM has to
   update the registration within its lifetime as per Appendix A.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory], and has to change the content of
   the registration when a join resource is added/removed or if its
   target attributes have to be changed, such as in the following cases.

   o  The GM creates a new OSCORE group and starts exporting the related
      join resource.

   o  The GM dismisses an OSCORE group and stops exporting the related
      join resource.

   o  Information related to an existing OSCORE group changes, e.g. the
      list of associated multicast IP addresses.

   In order to perform an update to the set of links in its
   registration, the GM can re-register with the RD and fully specify
   all links to its join resources and their target attributes in the
   payload of the POST request.

   The example below shows the same GM from Section 3 that re-registers
   with the RD, including the same join resource associated to the
   OSCORE group with zeroed-epoch Group ID "feedca570000", plus a second
   join resource associated to the OSCORE group with zeroed-epoch Group
   ID "ech0ech00000" and one multicast IP address ff35:30:2001:db8::45.

   Interaction: RD -> GM

   Res: 2.04 Changed

   Alternatively, the GM can perform a PATCH/iPATCH [RFC8132] request to
   the RD, as per Appendix A.4 of [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory].
   This requires semantics to be defined in future standards, in order
   to apply a link-format document as a patch to a different one.

5.  Discovery of OSCORE Groups

   A CoAP endpoint that wants to join an OSCORE group might not have all
   the necessary information at deployment time.  Also, it might want to
   know about possible new OSCORE groups created afterwards by the
   respective Group Managers.

   To this end, the CoAP endpoint can perform a resource lookup at the
   RD as per Section 7.1 of [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory], in order
   to retrieve the missing pieces of information needed to join the
   OSCORE group(s) of interest.  The CoAP endpoint can find the RD as
   described in Section 4 of [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory].

   The lookup filtering MUST consider the following search criteria.

   o  'rt' = "osc.j" (see Section 7.1).

   The lookup filtering MAY additionally consider the following search
   criteria, depending on the information already available to the CoAP
   endpoint.

   o  'oscore-gid', specifying the zeroed-epoch Group ID of the OSCORE
      group of interest.

   o  'ep', specifying the identifier of the GM as endpoint registered
      with the RD.

Internet-Draft   OSCORE group discovery with the CoRE RD    October 2018


   Consistently with the examples in Section 3 and Section 4, the
   example below shows a CoAP endpoint that wants to join the OSCORE
   group with zeroed-epoch Group ID "feedca570000", but that does not
   know the responsible GM and the join resource to access.

   The example below also shows how the CoAP endpoint uses observation
   [RFC7641], in order to be notified of possible changes in the join
   resource's target attributes.  This is also useful to handle the case
   where the OSCORE group of interest has not been created yet, so that
   the CoAP endpoint can receive the requested information when
   available at a later point in time.

   Interaction: Joining node -> RD

   Req: GET coap://rd.example.com/lookup/res?rt=osc.j&\
   oscore-gid=feedca570000
   Observe: 0

   Interaction: RD -> Joining node

   Res: 2.05 Content
   Observe: 24
   Payload:
   <coap://[2001:db8::ab]/join/feedca570000>;rt="osc.j";
   oscore-gid="feedca570000";oscore-group-ip="ff35:30:2001:db8::23";
   anchor="coap://[2001:db8::ab]"

   Depending on the used search criteria, the CoAP endpoint performing
   the resource lookup can get a response whose payload is quite large
   in size.  This can happen, for instance, in case the lookup request
   targets all the join resources at a specified GM, or all the join
   resources of all the registered GMs, as in the example below.

   Interaction: Joining node -> RD

   Req: GET coap://rd.example.com/lookup/res?rt=osc.j

   Interaction: RD -> Joining node

   Res: 2.05 Content
   Payload:
   <coap://[2001:db8::ab]/join/feedca570000>;rt="osc.j";
   oscore-gid="feedca570000";oscore-group-ip="ff35:30:2001:db8::23";
   anchor="coap://[2001:db8::ab]",
   <coap://[2001:db8::ab]/join/ech0ech00000>;rt="osc.j";
   oscore-gid="ech0ech00000";oscore-group-ip="ff35:30:2001:db8::45";

   <coap://[2001:db8::cd]/join/abcdef120000>;rt="osc.j";
   oscore-gid="abcdef120000";oscore-group-ip="ff35:30:2001:db8::67";
   anchor="coap://[2001:db8::cd]"

   Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that a CoAP endpoint performing a
   resource lookup to discover OSCORE groups uses observation only when
   including the fine-grained seach criterion 'oscore-gid' in its GET
   request sent to the RD.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations as described in Section 8 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory] apply here as well.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has the following actions for IANA.

7.1.  Resource Types

   IANA is asked to enter the following value into the Resource Type
   (rt=) Link Target Attribute Values subregistry within the Constrained
