    DTLS Tunnel between Media Distribution Device and Key Management
                  Function to Facilitate Key Exchange
                    draft-jones-perc-dtls-tunnel-02

Abstract

   This document defines a DTLS tunneling protocol for use in multimedia
   conferences that enables a Media Distribution Device (MDD) to
   facilitate key exchange between an endpoint in a conference and the
   Key Management Function (KMF) responsible for key distribution.  The
   protocol is designed to ensure that the keying material used for hop-
   by-hop encryption and authentication is accessible to the MDD, while
   the keying material used for end-to-end encryption and authentication
   is inaccessible to the MDD.

1.  Introduction

   An objective of the work in the Privacy-Enhanced RTP Conferencing
   (PERC) working group is to ensure that endpoints in a multimedia
   conference have access to the end-to-end (E2E) and hop-by-hop (HBH)
   keying material used to encrypt and authenticate Real-time Transport
   Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] packets, while the Media Distribution Device
   (MDD) has access only to the hop-by-hop (HBH) keying material for
   encryption and authentication.

   This specification defines a tunneling protocol that enables the MDD
   to tunnel DTLS [RFC6347] messages between an endpoint and the KMF,
   thus allowing an endpoint to use DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764] for establishing
   encryption and authentication keys with the KMF.

   The tunnel established between the MDD and KMF is a DTLS association
   that is established before any messages are forwarded on behalf of
   the endpoint by the MDD.  DTLS packets received from the endpoint are
   encapsulated by the MDD inside this tunnel as data to be sent to the
   KMF.  Likewise, when the MDD receives data from the KMF over the
   tunnel, it extracts the DTLS message inside and forwards that to the
   endpoint.  In this way, the DTLS association for the DTLS-SRTP

Internet-Draft            DTLS Tunnel for PERC                March 2016


   procedures is established between the endpoint and the KMF, with the
   MDD simply forwarding packets between the two entities and having no
   visibility into the confidential information exchanged or derived.

   Following the existing DTLS-SRTP procedures, the endpoint and KMF
   will arrive at a selected cipher and keying material, which are used
   for HBH encryption and authentication by both the endpoint and the
   MDD.  However, since the MDD would not have direct access to this
   information, the KMF explicitly shares the HBH key information with
   the MDD via the tunneling protocol defined in this document.

   By establishing this DTLS tunnel between the MDD and KMF and
   implementing the protocol defined in this document, it is possible
   for the MDD to facilitate the establishment of a secure DTLS
   association between an endpoint and the KMF in order for the endpoint
   to receive E2E and HBH keying material.  At the same time, the KMF
   can securely provide the HBH keying material to the MDD.

3.  Tunneling Concept

   A DTLS association (tunnel) is established between the MDD and the
   KMF.  This tunnel is used to relay DTLS messages between the endpoint
   and KMF, as depicted in Figure 1:

   The three entities involved in this communication flow are the
   endpoint, the MDD, and the KMF.  The behavior of each entity is
   described in Section 5.

   The KMF is a logical function that might might be co-resident with a
   key management server operated by an enterprise, reside in one of the
   endpoints participating in the conference, or elsewhere that is
   trusted with E2E keying material.  This document does not preclude
   any location, only requiring that the KMF not allow the MDD to gain
   access to the E2E keying material by following the operations
   defined.

4.  Example Message Flows

   This section provides an example message flow to help clarify the
   procedures described later in this document.  Note that it is assumed
   that a mutually authenticated DTLS association is already established
   between the MDD and KMF for the purpose of sending tunneled messages.

   Once the tunnel is established, it is possible for the MDD to relay
   the DTLS messages between the endpoint and the KMF.  Figure 2 shows a
   message flow wherein the endpoint uses DTLS-SRTP to establish an
   association with the KMF.  In the process, the MDD shares its
   supported SRTP protection profile information (see [RFC5764]) and the
   KMF shares HBH keying material and selected cipher with the MDD.  The
   message used to tunnel the DTLS messages is named "Tunnel" and can
   include Profiles or Key Info data.

   Each of these tunneled messages on the right-hand side of Figure 2 is
   a message of type "Tunnel" (see Section 6).  Each message contains
   the following information:

   o  Protocol version
   o  Association ID
   o  DTLS message being tunneled

   Additionally, all messages sent by the MDD will contain MDD-supported
   SRTP protection profiles at the end of the Tunnel message.  The KMF
   will need to select a common profile supported by both the endpoint
   and the MDD to ensure that hop-by-hop operations can successfully be
   performed.

   Further, the KMF will provide the SRTP [RFC3711] keying material for
   HBH operations at the time it sends a DTLS Finished message to the
   endpoint via the tunnel.  The MDD would extract this Key Info when
   received and use it for hop-by-hop encryption and authentication.
   The delivery of the keying information along with the completion of
   the DTLS handshake ensures the delivery of the keying information is
   fate shared with completion of the DTLS handshake so that the MDD is
   guaranteed to have the HBH keying information before it receives any
   media that is encrypted or authenticated with that key.

5.  Tunneling Procedures

   The following sub-sections explain in detail the expected behavior of
   the endpoint, the media distribution device (MDD), and the key
   management function (KMF).

   It is important to note that the tunneling protocol described in this
   document is not an extension to TLS [RFC5246] or DTLS [RFC6347].
   Rather, it is a protocol that transports endpoint or KMF-generated
   DTLS messages as data inside of the DTLS association established
   between the MDD and KMF.

5.1.  Endpoint Procedures

   The endpoint follows the procedures outlined for DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764]
   in order to establish the keys used for encryption and
   authentication.  The endpoint uses the normal procedures to establish
   a DTLS-SRTP association with the KMF.

5.2.  Media Distribution Device Tunneling Procedures

   The MDD, acting as a client, establishes a mutually authenticated
   DTLS association between itself and a KMF to relay DTLS messages from
   any number of endpoints to that KMF.  This MDD initiated DTLS

Internet-Draft            DTLS Tunnel for PERC                March 2016


   association is called a "tunnel" to differentiate it from the DTLS
   associations initiated by endpoints.

   The MDD MUST establish a tunnel with the KMF in advance of, or no
   later than the point, when an endpoint attempts to establish a DTLS
   association with the KMF.

   The MDD MUST forward all messages received from an endpoint for a
   given DTLS association through the same tunnel if more than one
   tunnel has been established between it and a KMF.  An MDD is not
   precluded from establishing more than one tunnel to a given KMF.

   The MDD MUST assign a tunnel-unique "association identifier" for each
   endpoint-initiated DTLS association and include it in all messages
   forwarded to the KMF.  The KMF will subsequently include in this
   identifier in all messages it sends so that the MDD can map messages
   received via a given tunnel and forward those messages to the correct
   endpoint.

   The tunnel protocol enables the KMF to separately provide HBH keying
   material to the MDD for each of the individual endpoint DTLS
   associations, though the MDD cannot decrypt messages between the KMF
   and endpoints.

   When a DTLS message is received by the MDD from an endpoint, it
   forwards the UDP payload portion of that message to the KMF
   encapsulated in a Tunnel + Profiles message (see Section 6).  The
   Tunnel + Profiles message allows the MDD to signal which SRTP
   protection profiles it supports for HBH operations.

   The MDD MUST support the same list of protection profiles for the
   life of a given endpoint's DTLS association, which is represented by
   the association identifier.

   When a message from the KMF includes "Key Info," the MDD MUST extract
   the cipher and keying material conveyed in order to subsequently
   perform HBH encryption and authentication operations for RTP and RTCP
   packets sent between it and an endpoint.  Since the HBH keying
   material will be different for each endpoint, the MDD uses the
   tunnel-unique association identifier included by the KMF to ensure
   that the HBH keying material is used with the correct endpoint.

   The MDD MUST forward all messages received from either the endpoint
   or the KMF to ensure proper communication between those two entities.

Internet-Draft            DTLS Tunnel for PERC                March 2016


5.3.  Key Management Function Tunneling Procedures

   The KMF MUST be prepared to establish one or more tunnels (DTLS
   associations) with the MDD for the purpose of relaying DTLS messages
   between an endpoint and the KMF.  The KMF acts as a server and the
   MDD acts as a client to establish a tunnel.

   When the MDD relays a DTLS message from an endpoint, the MDD will
   include an association identifier that is unique per endpoint-
   originated DTLS association and is relayed via the tunnel.  The
   association identifier remains constant for the life of the DTLS
   association.  The KMF identifies each distinct endpoint-originated
   DTLS association by the association identifier and the tunnel over
   which the DTLS association was established.

   The KMF MUST encapsulate the DTLS message inside a Tunnel message
   (see Section 6) when sending a message to an endpoint.

   The KMF MUST use the same association identifier in messages sent to
   an endpoint and MUST send all messages for a given endpoint DTLS
   association via the same tunnel.  This ensures the MDD can forward
   the messages to the correct endpoint.

   The KMF extracts tunneled DTLS messages from an endpoint and acts on
   those messages as if that endpoint had established the DTLS
   association directly with the KMF, which is acting as the server and
   the endpoint as the client.  The handling of the messages and
   certificates is exactly the same as normal DTLS-SRTP procedures
   between endpoints.

   The KMF MUST send a DTLS Finished message to the endpoint at the
   point the the DTLS handshake completes.  This is accomplished by
   utilizing the Tunnel + Key Info message.  The Key Info includes the
   selected cipher (i.e. protection profile), , MKI [RFC3711] value (if
   any), SRTP master keys, and SRTP master salt values.

   The KMF MUST select a cipher that is supported by both the endpoint
   and the MDD for proper operations.

6.  Tunneling Protocol

   The tunneling protocol is transmitted over the DTLS association
   established between the MDD and KMF as application data.  The basic
   message is referred to as the Tunnel message.  The MDD will append
   supported SRTP protection profiles to all Tunnel messages it sends,
   forming the Tunnel + Profiles message.  The KMF will append
   information necessary for the MDD to perform HBH encryption and
   authentication as it transmits the DTLS Finished message to the

   Beyond the fields included in the Tunnel message, this message
   introduces the following additional fields.

   Data Type: Indicates the type of data that follows.  For MDD
   supported SRTP protection profiles, this value is 0x01.

   Length: This is the length in octets of the protection profiles.
   This length must be greater than or equal to 2.

   Protection Profiles: This is an array of two-octet SRTP protection
   profile values as per [RFC5764], with each value represented in
   network byte order.

6.3.  Tunnel Message + Key Info

   When the KMF has key information to share with the MDD so it can
   perform HBH encryption and authentication on received media packets,
   the KMF will send a Tunnel message with the Key Info appended as
   shown below:

   Beyond the fields included in the Tunnel message, this message
   introduces the following additional fields.

   Data Type: Indicates the type of data that follows.  For key
   information, this value is 0x02.

   Protection Profile: This is the SRTP protection profile (see
   [RFC5764]) the MDD MUST use to encrypt and decrypt packets sent and
   received between itself and the endpoint.

   MKI Length: This is the length in octets of the MKI field.  A value
   of zero indicates that the MKI field is absent.

   CWSMK Length: The length of the "Client Write SRTP Master Key" field.

   Client Write SRTP Master Key: The value of the SRTP master key used
   by the client (endpoint).

   SWSMK Length: The length of the "Server Write SRTP Master Key" field.

   Server Write SRTP Master Key: The value of the SRTP master key used
   by the server (MDD).

   CWSMS Length: The length of the "Client Write SRTP Master Salt"
   field.

   Client Write SRTP Master Salt: The value of the SRTP master salt used
   by the client (endpoint).

   SWSMS Length: The length of the "Server Write SRTP Master Salt"
   field.

   Server Write SRTP Master Salt: The value of the SRTP master salt used
   by the server (MDD).

7.  To-Do List

   The MDD and KMF may need to coordinate or exchange a "conference
   identifier" common to the endpoints a MDD is bridging together.
   Alternatively, information the KMF needs to know about conference-to-
   endpoint correlations might be satisfied by getting info directly
   from the endpoints, or some trusted entity on their behalf, via some
   other means.  Need to revisit this design choice in the context of
   all the alternatives.

8.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations for this document.

9.  Security Considerations

   TODO - Much more needed.

   The encapsulated data is protected by the DTLS session from the
   endpoint to KMF and the MDD is merely an on path entity.  This does
   not introduce any additional security concerns beyond a normal DTLS-
   SRTP session.

   The HBH keying material is protected by the mutual authenticated DTLS
   session between the MDD and KMF.  The KMF MUST ensure that it only

   forms associations with authorized MDDs or it could hand HBH keying
   information to untrusted parties.

   The supported profile information send from the MDD to the KMF is not
   particularly sensitive as it only provides the crypt algorithms
   supported by the MDD but it is still protected by the DTLS session
   from the MDD to KMF.
