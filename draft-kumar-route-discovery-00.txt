Abstract

   This document describes a route discovery scheme in the Internet. It
   could be well suited for any centralized distributed network like
   software-defined networks. This scheme could be an alternative of
   path computation element in inter-Autonomous domains routing
   protocol.

1  Introduction

   In this document, we specify the functional components, route
   representation and procedure of a new route discovery scheme.  The
   software-define networking (SDN) defined a centralized distributed
   network that may solve the problem of scaling of BGP with alteration.
   In SDN, the routing control plane is responsible for path computation
   and selection of routes. We consider this routing control plane as a
   routing entity and it identified by AS number. The proposed scheme
   utilize this routing entity's position and connectivity to search
   route between source and destination administrative domains's REs.  


2  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. In
   this document, these words will appear with that interpretation only
   when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance. In this document, the
   characters ">>" preceding an indented line(s) indicates a compliance
   requirement statement using the key words listed above. This
   convention aids reviewers in quickly identifying or finding the
   explicit compliance requirements of this RFC.


3  Assumptions

   - Each RE should be responsible for route related tasks (not
   forwarding) for respective AS.

   - Each RE knows the neighbor's neighbor list along with the Country
   code (describe in section 4.1) and connectivity value (describe in
   section 4.2) of each entry.


4  Functional components and detail of scheme

4.1  Connectivity value of an AS

   The connectivity value (c-value)of a RE is the number of directly
   connected ASs via outgoing links and reverse c-value of a RE is
   define as the number of directly connected ASs via incoming links. 

4.2  Country code

   All Regional Internet Registry (RIR) maintains the country code for

   each AS. The RIR uses International Standard ISO 3166 to define
   country codes for every ASs in the Internet [ISO-3166]. In this
   scheme we utilizes these codes for search route between source and
   destination's RE. 

   Any RE can modify the country code symbolically which assign it under
   following circumstance (only for route discovery ):

   - If c-value of any RE is one, than it modify the own code with
   neighbor's code.

   - If c-value of any RE is two, than it modify the own code with
   neighbor's code which has higher c-value.


4.3  Route representation and databases

   Like IP addresses, AS numbers are important Internet number
   resources. It defined with a unique number for each AS and express as
   32 bit numbers. The route discovered by scheme represent as series of
   AS numbers between source and destination's RE.

   This scheme uses neighbor list and neighbor's neighbor list with
   country code and c-value for each entry.

4.4  Route discovery 

   This scheme uses a discovery message for discover the route between
   pre-defined source and destination. When the destination receive
   discovery message, it issue an acknowledgement message for source
   with discovered route. The main procedure of the scheme is follows: 

   1. When destination's AS number exist in the neighbor list, it direct
   discovery packet to destination.

   2. When destination's AS number exist in the neighbor's neighbor
   list, it direct discovery packet to destination via a connecting RE.

   3. When destination's country code exist in the neighbor list, it
   direct discovery packet toward a neighbor which share destination's
   country code.

   4. When destination's AS number exist in the neighbor's neighbor list

   5. Otherwise, it direct discovery packet toward a neighbor with
   higher c-value.
