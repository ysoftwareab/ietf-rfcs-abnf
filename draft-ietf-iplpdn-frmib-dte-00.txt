     1.  Status of this Memo

     This draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor as an
     extension to the SNMP MIB.  Distribution of this memo is
     unlimited.  Please send comments to the author.


     2.  Abstract

     This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
     (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-
     based internets.  In particular, it defines objects for
     managing Frame Relay.













     Draft                Frame Relay DTE MIB            March 1993


     This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
     community.



     3.  The Network Management Framework

     The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of
     three components.  They are:

     RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
     describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
     RFC 1212 defines a more concise description mechanism, which
     is wholly consistent with the SMI.

     RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects
     for the Internet suite of protocols.  RFC 1213 defines MIB-II,
     an evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience and
     new operational requirements.

     RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network
     access to managed objects.

     The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
     purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

     4.  Objects

     Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
     termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
     MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
     One (ASN.1) [7] defined in the SMI.  In particular, each
     object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.  The name is an
     object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which
     specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
     object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
     instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
     use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also
     refer to the object type.

     The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data
     structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
     language is used for this purpose.  However, the SMI [3]
     purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
     These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.

     The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type
     is represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly
     tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is
     how the object type is represented when being transmitted on
     the network.

     The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1
     [8], subject to the additional requirements imposed by the
     SNMP.


     4.1.  Format of Definitions

     Section 6 contains contains the specification of all object
     types contained in this MIB module.  The object types are
     defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended
     by the extensions specified in [9,10].

     5.  Overview

     5.1.  Frame Relay Operational Model

     For the purposes of understanding this document, Frame Relay
     is viewed as a multi-access media, not as a group of point-
     to-point connections.  This model proposes that Frame Relay is
     a single interface to the network (physical connection) with
     many destinations or neighbors (virtual connections).  This
     view enables a network manager the ability to group all
     virtual connections with their corresponding physical
     connection thereby allowing simpler diagnostics and trouble
     shooting.

     5.2.  Textual Conventions

     Several new data types are introduced as a textual convention
     in this MIB document.  These textual conventions enhance the
     readability of the specification and can ease comparison with
     other specifications if appropriate.  It should be noted that
     the introduction of the these textual conventions has no
     effect on either the syntax nor the semantics of any managed
     objects.  The use of these is merely an artifact of the
     explanatory method used.  Objects defined in terms of one of
     these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that
     define the primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or
     the SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual
     conventions which are adopted merely for the convenience of
     readers and writers in pursuit of the elusive goal of clear,
     concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.

     The new data types are Index and DLCI.  Index refers to the
     range 1..ifNumber, and is used to establish the correspondence
     between ifEntries and Frame Relay Interfaces.  DLCI refers to
     the range 0..DLCINumber, and is used to refer to the valid
     Data Link Connection Indices.  DLCINumber is, by definition,
     the largest possible DLCI value possible under the configured
     Q.922 Address Format.

     5.3.  Structure of MIB

     The MIB is composed of three groups, one defining the Data
     Link Connection Management Interface (DLCMI), one describing
     the Circuits, and a third describing errors.

     Draft                Frame Relay DTE MIB            March 1993


     During normal operation, Frame Relay virtual circuits will be
     added, deleted and change availability.  The occurrence of
     such changes is of interest to the network manager and
     therefore, one trap is defined, intended to be corollary to
     the SNMP "Link Up" and "Link Down" traps.
