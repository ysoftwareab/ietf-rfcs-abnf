              URN For Country Specific Emergency Services
                draft-ietf-ecrit-country-emg-urn-03.txt

Abstract

   Section 4.2 of RFC 5031 allows the registration of service URNs with
   the 'sos' service type only for emergency services "that are offered
   widely and in different countries".  This document updates those
   instructions in RFC 5031 to allow such registrations when, at the
   time of registration, those services are offered in one country only.

1.  Introduction

   Table 1 shows the policy for registration of sub-services of the
   service URN with the 'sos' service type, as defined in section 4.2.
   of RFC 5031 [RFC5031].

   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | The 'sos' service type describes emergency services requiring an  |
   | immediate response, typically offered by various branches of the  |
   | government or other public institutions.  Additional sub-services |
   | can be added after expert review and must be of general public    |
   | interest and have a similar emergency nature.  The expert is      |
   | designated by the ECRIT working group, its successor, or, in      |
   | their absence, the IESG.  The expert review should only approve   |
   | emergency services that are offered widely and in different       |
   | countries, with approximately the same caller expectation in      |
   | terms of services rendered.  The 'sos' service is not meant to    |
   | invoke general government, public information, counseling, or     |
   | social services.                                                  |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+

                Table 1: Excerpt from RFC 5031 section 4.2.

   Some existing emergency services are, at least initially, offered in
   one country only.  Examples are the "Reporting spies" emergency
   service offered in South Korea and the "GAULA (anti-kidnapping)"
   emergency service offered in Colombia according to http://
   en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number (as per January 8th
   2014).  Future emergency service might also initially be introduced
   in one country only.

   The policy for registration of sub-services of the service URN with
   the 'sos' service type, as defined in RFC 5031 [RFC5031], prevents
   the registration of a sub-service of the service URN with the 'sos'
   service type for a service that, at the time of registration, is
   offered in one country only.

   This document updates the 2nd paragraph of section 4.2 of RFC 5031
   [RFC5031], in order to allow the registration of service URNs with
   the 'sos' service type for emergency services that, at the time of
   registration, are offered in one country only.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

3.  Update to RFC 5031

3.1.  General

   Section 3.2 of this document replaces the text of the 2nd paragraph
   of section 4.2 (Sub-Services for the 'sos' Service) of RFC 5031
   [RFC5031].

3.2.  New text replacing the text of the 2nd paragraph of section 4.2 of
      RFC 5031

   The 'sos' service type describes emergency services requiring an
   immediate response, typically offered by various branches of the
   government or other public institutions.  Additional sub-services can
   be added after expert review.  The expert is designated by the ECRIT
   working group, its successor, or, in their absence, the IESG.  The
   designated expert should only approve services that have emergency
   nature, that are offered in at least one country, that do not match
   description of any existing service URN with the 'sos' service type,
   and where the service description and the URN are defined as broadly
   as possible to encourage reuse.  The 'sos' service is not meant to
   invoke general government, public information, counseling, or social
   services.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the advice to the expert for the registry of
   sub-services of the "sos" service.  IANA is requested to update the
   reference for that registry from RFC 5031 [RFC5031] to this document.
