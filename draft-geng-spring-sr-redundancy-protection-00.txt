               Segment Routing for Redundancy Protection
             draft-geng-spring-sr-redundancy-protection-00

Abstract

   Redundancy protection is one of the mechanisms to achieve service
   protection, following the principle of PREOF (Packet Replication/
   Elimination/Ordering Function).  To empower the Segment Routing with
   the capability of redundancy protection, two types of Segment
   including Redundancy Segment and Merging Segment are introduced.  The
   instantiation of Redundancy and Merging Segments can be applied to
   both segment routing over MPLS (SR-MPLS) and segment routing over
   IPv6 (SRv6).

1.  Introduction

   Service protection defined in [RFC8655] is initially required from
   the use cases in a variety of industries described in [RFC8578].
   Together with other two techniques Resource allocation and Explicit
   routes, targets to provide the deterministic flow transmission.
   Meanwhile, with the emerge of Cloud VR, Cloud Game, HDV (high-
   definition video) applications running in the Internet, SLA (Service
   Level Agreement) guarantee becomes an important issue which requires
   new technologies and solutions for network.

   Redundancy Protection is one of the mechanisms to achieve service
   protection, following the principle of PREOF (Packet Replication/
   Elimination/Ordering Function) defined in [RFC8655].  Specifically,
   replicates the packets of flows into two or more copies, transports

   different copies through different path in parallel, eliminates and
   orders the packets at end to provide redundancy protection.

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  An
   ingress node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions,
   called "segments".  A segment can be associated to an arbitrary
   processing of the packet in the node identified by the segment.

   This document extends the capabilities in SR paradigm to support the
   redundancy protection, including the definitions of new Segments and
   a variation of Segment Routing Policy.  The new mechanism applies
   equally to both segment routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and
   segment routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).

2.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming] and[RFC2119].

   Redundancy Node: the start point of redundancy protection, which is a
   network device that could implement packet replication

   Merging Node: the end point of redundancy protection, which is a
   network node that could implement packet elimination and ordering
   (optionally)

   Redundancy Policy: an extended SR policy which includes more than one
   active segment lists to support redundancy protection

   Flow Identification: information in SR data service to indicate one
   flow

   Sequence Number: information in SR data service to indicate the
   packet sequence of one flow

   Editor's Note: Similar mechanism is defined as "Service Protection"
   in the [RFC8655].  In this document, we define a new term "Redundancy
   Protection" to distinguish with other service protection method.
   Some of the terms are similar as [RFC8655].

   Figure 1: Example Scenario of Redundancy Protection in SR Domain

   This figure shows the process of redundancy protection when a flow is
   sent into SR domain:

   1) R1 receives the packet flow and encapsulates with segment to
   destination R2, either instantiated in a stack of MPLS labels or
   Segment Routing Extension Header (SRH) defined in [RFC8754];

   2) When the packet flow arrives in Red node, known as Redundancy
   Node, one flow is replicated to two copies with the same flow
   identifier; For each packet in one flow, sequence number is marked to
   indicate the packet sequence; the flow identifier and sequence number
   of each packet can alternatively be marked at the ingress edge R1 of
   SR domain;

   3) Two replicated flows go through different paths till Mer node,
   known as Merging Node; When there is any failures happened in one
   path, the service continues to deliver through the other path without
   break;

   4) The first received packet of the flow is transmitted from Merging
   Node to R2, and the redundant packets are eliminated;

   5) Sometimes, the packet will arrive out of order because of
   redundancy protection, the function of reordering may be necessary in
   the Merging Node;

   In this example, service protection is supported by utilizing at
   least two packet flows transmitted over two candidate paths.  For a
   unidirectional flow, Red node supports replication function, and Mer
   node supports elimination and ordering functions.

4.  Segment to Support Redundancy Protection

   To achieve the Packet Replication/ Elimination/Ordering Function,
   Redundancy Segment and Merging Segment are introduced.

4.1.  Redundancy Segment

   Redundancy Segment is associated with a Redundancy Policy on
   redundancy node.  Redundancy Segment is associated with service
   instructions, indicating the following operations:

   o  Steering the packet into the corresponding redundancy policy

   o  Packet replication based on the redundancy policy, e.g., the
      number of replication copies

   o  Encapsulate the packet with necessary meta data (e.g., flow
      identification, sequence number) if it is not included in the
      original packet

   In the case of SRv6, a new behavior End.R for Redundancy Segment is
   defined.

   When N receives a packet whose IPv6 DA is S and S is a Redundancy
   SID, N does:

S01.  When an SRH is processed {
S02.     If (Segments Left>0)   {
S03.          Create two headers IPv6+SRH-1 and IPv6+SRH-2
S04.          Insert different policy-instructed segment lists into SRH-1 and SRH-2
S05.          Add Flow Identification and Sequence Number to SRH-1 and SRH-2
S06.          Remove the incoming outer IPv6+SRH header
S07.          Create a duplication of the incoming packet payload
S08.          Encapsulate the original packet with IPv6+SRH-1 header
S09.          Encapsulate the duplicate packet with IPv6+SRH-2 header
S10.          Set IPv6 SA as the local address of this node
S11.          Set IPv6 DA of IPv6+SRH-1 to the first segment of SRv6 Policy in SRH-1
S12.          Set IPv6 DA of IPv6+SRH-2 to the first segment of SRv6 Policy in SRH-2
S13.     }
S14.     ELSE {
S15.          Drop the packet
S16.     }

4.2.  Merging Segment

   Merging Segment is associated with service instructions, indicates
   the following operations:

   o  Packet merging and elimination: forward the first received packets
      and eliminate the redundant packets

   o  Packet ordering(optional): reorder the packets if the packet
      arrives out of order

Internet-Draft                                             November 2020


   In the case of SRv6, a new behavior End.M for Merging Segment is
   defined.

   When N receives a packet whose IPv6 DA is S and S is a Merging SID, N
   does:

S01.  When an SRH is processed {
S02.     If (Segments Left>0) & "the packet is not a redundant packet" {
S03.          Do not decrement SL nor update the IPv6 DA with SRH[SL]
S04.          Create a new outer IPv6+SRH-3 header
S05.          Insert the policy-instructed segment lists in the newly created SRH-3
S06.          Remove the incoming outer IPv6+SRH header
S07.          Set IPv6 DA of IPv6+SRH-3 to the first segment of SRv6 Policy in SRH-3
S08.     }
S09.     ELSE {
S10.          Drop the packet
S11.     }

5.  Meta Information to Support Redundancy Protection

   To distinguish the different copies replicated at Redundancy node,
   and distinguish the different packets in the same flow to perform
   elimination and ordering, the definition of Flow Identification and
   Sequence Number is required.

   Flow Identification and Sequence Number can be defined as MPLS labels
   in SR over MPLS data plane, or as option TLV in SRH header in SR over
   IPv6 data plane.  This information must be carried along the path to
   Merging node.  Merging node removes Flow Identifier and Sequence
   Number once the elimination and ordering is accomplished.

6.  Segment Routing Policy to Support Redundancy Protection

   Redundancy Policy is a variation of SR Policy, which is identified
   through the tuple <redundancy node, redundancy ID, merging node>.
   Redundancy Policy extends SR policy to include more than one ordered
   lists of segments between redundancy node and merging node to steer
   the same flow through different paths in SR domain.  In Redundancy
   Policy, Redundancy Segment MUST be specified, and the last segment of
   each ordered list of segments SHOULD be Merging Segment.
