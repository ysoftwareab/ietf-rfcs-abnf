1.  Introduction

   Historically, DNS stub resolvers communicated with recursive
   resolvers without needing to know anything about the features
   supported by these recursive resolvers.  As more and more recursive
   resolvers expose different features that may impact the delivered DNS
   service, means to help stub resolvers to identify the capabilities of
   the resolver are valuable.  Typically, stub resolvers can discover
   and authenticate encrypted DNS servers provided by a local network,
   for example, using the techniques specified in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and
   [I-D.ietf-add-ddr].  However, these stub resolvers need a means to
   retrieve information from the discovered recursive resolvers about
   their capabilities.

   This document fills that void by specifying a method for stub
   resolvers to retrieve such information.  To that aim, a new RRtype is
   defined for stub resolvers to query the recursive resolvers.  The
   information that a resolver might want to give is defined in
   Section 5.

   Retrieved information can be used to feed the server selection
   procedure.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

Internet-Draft          DNS Resolver Information              April 2021


   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499].

   'Encrypted DNS' refers to a DNS protocol that provides an encrypted
   channel between a DNS client and server (e.g., DoT, DoH, or DoQ).

3.  Retrieving Resolver Information

   A stub resolver that wants to retrieve the resolver information may
   use the RRtype "RESINFO" defined in this document (see Section 7.1).

   The content of the RDATA in a response to RRtype query is defined in
   Section 5.  If the resolver understands the RESINFO RRtype, the RRset
   in the Answer section MUST have exactly one record.

   The client can retrieve the resolver information using the RESINFO
   RRtype and QNAME of the domain name that is used to authenticate the
   DNS server (referred to as ADN in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr]).

   If the special use domain name "resolver.arpa" defined in [I-D.ietf-
   add-ddr] is used to discover the Encrypted DNS server, the client can
   first retrieve a CNAME that aliases `_dns.resolver.arpa` to
   `_dns.$HOSTNAME` and then retrieve the resolver information using the
   RESINFO RRtype and QNAME of the `$HOSTNAME`.

4.  Format of the Resolver Information

   The resolver information is returned as a JSON object.  Precisely,
   the JSON object MUST use the I-JSON message format [RFC7493].

      Note that [RFC7493] was based on [RFC7159], but [RFC7159] was
      replaced by [RFC8259].  Requiring the use of I-JSON instead of
      more general JSON format greatly increases the likelihood of
      interoperability.

   The JSON object returned by a DNS query may contain any name/value
   pairs.  All names MUST consist only of lower-case ASCII characters,
   digits, and hyphens (that is, Unicode characters U+0061 through 007A,
   U+0030 through U+0039, and U+002D).  These names MUST be 63
   characters or shorter.

   All names in the returned object MUST either be defined in the IANA
   registry Section 7.2 or begin with the substring "temp-" for names
   defined for local use only.

5.  Resolver Information

   The resolver information includes the following attributes:

   qnameminimization:  If the DNS server supports QNAME minimisation
      [RFC7816] to improve DNS privacy, the parameter value is set to
      true.  This is a mandatory attribute.

   extendeddnserror:  If the DNS server supports extended DNS error
      (EDE) [RFC8914] to return additional information about the cause
      of DNS errors, the parameter lists the possible extended DNS error
      codes that can be returned by the DNS server.  This is an optional
      attribute.

         Note that the extended error code "Blocked" defined in
         Section 4.16 of [RFC8914] identifies access to domains is
         blocked due to an policy by the operator of the DNS server,
         extended error code "Censored" defined in Section 4.17 of
         [RFC8914] identifies access to domains is blocked based on a
         requirement from an external entity and the extended error code
         "Filtered" defined in Section 4.18 of [RFC8914] identifies
         access to domains is blocked based on the request from the
         client to blacklist domains.

   clientauth:  If the DNS server requires client authentication, the
      parameter value is set to true.  For example, when not on the
      enterprise network (e.g., coffee shop) yet needing to access the
      enterprise Encrypted DNS server, roaming users can use client
      authentication to access the Enterprise-provided Encrypted DNS
      server.  This is an optional attribute.

   resinfourl:  An URL that points to the generic unstructured resolver
      information (e.g., DoH APIs supported, possible HTTP status codes
      returned by the DoH server, how to report a problem) for
      troubleshooting purpose.  The server MUST support the content-type
      'text/html'.  This is a mandatory attribute.

   identityurl:  An URL that points to a human-friendly description of
      the resolver identity to display to the end-user.  The server MUST
      support the content-type 'text/plain'.  This is a mandatory
      attribute.

   New attributes can be defined as per the procedure defined in
   Section 7.2.

   As specified in [RFC7493], the I-JSON object is encoded as UTF8.
   [RFC7493] explicitly allows the returned objects to be in any order.

   }

6.  Security Considerations

   Unless a DNS request to retrieve the resolver information is
   encrypted (e.g., sent over DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858] or DNS-over-
   HTTPS (DoH)) [RFC8484], the response is susceptible to forgery.  The
   DNS resolver information can be retrieved after the encrypted
   connection is established to the DNS server.  If the client wishes to
   retrieve the resolver information before the encryption connection is
   established to the DNS resolver, the client MUST use local DNSSEC
   validation.

7.  IANA Considerations

      Note to the RFC Editor: Please update [RFCXXXX] with the RFC
      number to be assigned to this document.

7.1.  RESINFO RRtype

   This document requests IANA to register a new value from the
   "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs" subregistry of the "Domain Name System
   (DNS) Parameters" registry available at [RRTYPE]:

   Type: RESINFO
   Value: TBD
   Meaning: Resolver Information as an I-JSON
   Reference: [RFCXXXX]

7.2.  DNS Resolver Information Registration

   This document requests IANA to create a new registry entitled "DNS
   Resolver Information".  This registry contains definitions of the
   names that can be used to provide the resolver information.

Internet-Draft          DNS Resolver Information              April 2021


   The registration procedure is Specification Required (Section 4.6 of
   [RFC8126]).

   The structure of the registry is as follows:

   Name:  The name to be used in the JSON object.  The name MUST conform
      to the definition of "string" in I-JSON message format.  The IANA
      registry MUST NOT register names that begin with "temp-", so these
      names can be used freely by any implementer.

   Value Type:  The type of data to be used in the JSON object.

   Description:  Provides a description of the attribute

   Specification:  The reference specification for the registered
      element.

   The initial content of this registry is provided in Table 1.
