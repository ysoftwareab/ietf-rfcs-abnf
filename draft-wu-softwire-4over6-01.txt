Abstract

   Due to the rapid deployment of IPv6 networks, especially IPv6
   backbones, the existing long-live IPv4 networks are going to be
   connected to these IPv6 networks.  In the environment that ISP hopes
   to use IPv6 backbones while still provides end users IPv4 access to
   support existing IPv4 applications, IPv4 traffic needs to be
   transported over IPv6 backbones.  Along with the growth of IPv6
   backbones, the number of IPv4 access networks increases and the

   IPv4/v6 interconnection topology becomes complex.  Therefore, the
   existing manual configuration mechanism for a large number of end-2-
   end tunnels will cause an insufferable burden.  This draft addresses
   this problem and presents a mechanism of automatic 4over6 tunnel-end
   discovery with BGP extensions.

Internet-Draft                   4over6                   September 2006


1.  Introduction

   With the rapid deployment of IPv6 networks, especially IPv6
   backbones, some IPv6 backbones need to act as IPv6 transit cores to
   provide packet transport service to IPv4 access networks.  Although
   there are some related tunneling protocols or mechanisms in the
   literature, most of the existing tunneling mechanisms focus on the
   problem of IPv6 over IPv4, rather than the upcoming one of IPv4 over
   IPv6.  Additionally, although some encapsulation methods, e.g.
   [RFC2473], present specifications for generic packet tunneling in
   IPv6, the insufferable burden of manual configuration prevents the
   wide deployment of existing related end-2-end tunnels in a large-
   scale IPv4/v6 interconnected networks.  Thus, new techniques need to
   provide automatic tunneling mechanism for scalable IPv4 packet
   transmission over an IPv6 backbone, which is abbreviated as 4over6.

   Generally speaking, 4over6 mechanism concerns two aspects: the
   control plane and the data plane.  The control plane needs to solve
   the problem of how to setup an IPv4 over IPv6 tunnel with proper
   method of tunnel end-point discovery.  This document extends BGP-MP
   to carry the tunnel end information to the other side of the IPv6
   backbone to setup of a stateless 4over6 tunnel on the dual-stack
   Provider Edge (PE) router.  Based on the 4over6 tunnel, the data
   plane focuses on the data packet forwarding process with
   encapsulation and decapsulation.  In order to avoid redundant
   definition of packet encapsulation, this document reuses the existing
   techniques in this part.

2.1  4over6-related terminology

   4over6

   A technology of IPv4 packet transmission over IPv6 networks.

   4over6 PE Router

   A dual-stack provider edge router connecting IPv4 access networks and
   an IPv6 backbone with 4over6 functionality.Since the 4over6
   technology is aways employed at the PE rout, 4over6 PE Router is
   refered as to 4over6 Router in this draft.

   4over6 Virtual Interface

   A virtual interface with configured both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on
   the 4over6 PE router, where the encapsulated 4over6 packet is
   generated. 4over6 virtual interface is abbreviated as 4over6 VIF.

   4over6 Encapsulation Table

   A table maintained on AFBR consisting of mappings from destination
   IPv4 network address with mask to a specific IPv6 address.

3.  Intra-domain 4over6 framework

   In the IPv4/v6 interconnected network topology shown in figure 1, a
   number of P routers, only running the IPv6 network stack, compose a
   native IPv6 backbone.  In order to provide IPv4 access to the current
   IPv4 users/applications, PE routers run both IPv6 and IPv4 stacks.
   The IPv6 backbone acts as a transit core to transport IPv4 packets
   over the IPv6 backbone.  Therefore, each of IPv4 access islands can
   communicate with each other via the virtual softwires over the IPv6
   transit core.  The functionality of IPv4 connections over IPv6
   backbone is called 4over6.

   In addition to a general router and network topology, all additional
   things to implement 4over6 are 4over6 routing and 4over forwarding on
   the dual-stack PE routers.

   The IPv4 access island often uses default routing to a particular PE
   router on the IPv4 stack.  However, since there are multiple PE

   routers connected to an IPv6 transit core, in order to forward the
   IPv4 packet directly to an egress PE router with encapsulation
   mechanism, the ingress PE router needs to know which PE should be the
   egress one.  BGP-MP will be extended to carry the destination IPv4
   networks over the IPv6 backbone.  Section 4 presents the definition
   of 4over6 protocol field in BGP-MP and section 5 describes the
   extended behavior of BGP-MP.

   After ingress PE router finds the exact egress PE router, ingress one
   will use a particular encapsulation method to forward the original
   IPv4 packet over the IPv6 backbone.  Receiving the encapsulated
   packet from the IPv6 transit core, the egress router will decapsulate
   the packet to its original IPv4 format and then forwards the packet
   to its final IPv4 destination.  Section 6 describes the procedure of
   packet forwarding.

4.  4over6 packet forwarding

   4over6 packet forwarding includes the following 3 parts:
   encapsulation of the incoming IPv4 packet with IPv6 header;
   transmission of the encapsulated packet over the IPv6 transit
   backbone; and decapsulation to the original IPv4 format.  Since the
   IPv6 transit backbone is unaware of the transmitted packet, the
   transmission of the encapsulated packet is as usual as other IPv6
   packet on the IPv6 backbone.  As characteristics of 4over6 packet
   forwarding, both encapsulation and decapsulation are processed on the
   PE routers, so they will be described further as follows.

   Each or 4over6 router maintain an Encapsulation Table, as shown in
   Figure 4.  Each item in the encapsulation table consists of the
   destination IPv4 network address and its mask, and the IPv6 4over6
   VIF address of the corresponding advertising AFBR.

   Figure 4: Encapsulation Table

   When an IPv4 packet is coming into IPv6 backbone on the dual-stack PE
   router, the PE is called ingress 4over6 PE router or tunnel entry-
   point node, on which the IPv4 packet is encapsulated by a new IPv6
   header.  In this IPv6 header, the source IPv6 address is the IPv6
   address of the virtual 4over6 interface on this PE, while the
   destination IPv6 address is the one of the next hop of the
   corresponding route maintained by BGP 4over6 extensions.  When an
   encapsulated 4over6 packet is coming out of the IPv6 backbone on the
   dual-stack PE router, the PE is called egress 4over6 PE router or
   tunnel exit-point node, on which the encapsulated packet is

   decapsulated to its original IPv4 format.

   Details of packet encapsulation and decapsulation should refer to the
   definitions in [RFC2473].  In addition to such encapsulation with
   IPv4 over IPv6 described in [RFC2473], other existing method like GRE
   tunnel [RFC2784] can also be used directly for 4over6 encapsulation.
   Furthermore, 4over6 encapsulation can also use emerging technologies
   for IPv4 encapsulation over IPv6.

5.  BGP-MP 4over6 protocol definition

   [BGP-MP] defines the multiprotocol extension of BGP to carry
   different kinds of routing information [RFC2842] [RFC2858] [I-D.ietf-
   idr-rfc2858bis].  Optional parameter in the OPEN message indicates
   the capability of BGP entity by Address Family Identifier (AFI) and
   Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI).  The Path attribute
   MP_REACH_NLRI (Type Code 14) in BGP UPDATE Message includes AFI,
   SAFI, Network Address of Next Hop, and Network Layer Reachability
   Information (NLRI), as shown in figure 5.

         +---------------------------------------------------------+
         | Address Family Identifier (2 octets): AFI_IP4=1         |
         +---------------------------------------------------------+
         | Subsequent AFI (1 octet): SAFI_4OVER6 = 67              |
         +---------------------------------------------------------+
         | Length of Next Hop (1 octet): 16                        |
         +---------------------------------------------------------+
         | Next Hop: IPv6 Address of 4over6 Virtual Interface      |
         +---------------------------------------------------------+
         | Reserved(1 octet)                                       |
         +---------------------------------------------------------+
         | NLRI (variable): Destination IPv4 Network Address       |
         +---------------------------------------------------------+

   Figure 5: Path attribute MP_REACH_NLRI in BGP UPDATE Message

   4over6 BGP extension takes AFI as AFI_IP4=1, as the UPDATE message
   contains IPv4 routing information, and defines SAFI as SAFI_4OVER6 =
   67, as SAFI values 67 was assigned by IANA for 4over6 BGP extension.
   4over6 BGP extension uses the above AFI and SAFI to indicate the
   4over6 capability in its OPEN message, and to describe the 4over6
   routing information in its Path attribute within UPDATE Message.

   The path attribute MP_UNREACH_NLRI (Type Code 15) is set accordingly
   similar to MP_REACH_NLRI.

   Each PE router with 4over6 functionality should maintain a 4over6
   virtual interface with both IPv4 address and IPv6 address.  In the
   path attribute, Network Address of Next Hop should be IPv6 interface
   address, while the NLRI contains the destination IPv4 network address

6.  Behavior of BGP-MP 4over6 extension

   Standing on the edge between IPv4 address family and IPv6 address
   family, each PE router with 4over6 functionality should run both IPv4
   and IPv6 stack as AFBR.

   The PE router has at least one IPv4 interface connecting with IPv4
   access networks.  It can use either IGP or EGP routing protocol to
   learn the local IPv4 routing information on the IPv4 network.
   Configured static routing may be also used on the IPv4 network.

   Similarly, the PE router has at least one IPv6 interface connecting
   with IPv6 transit backbone.  The 4over6 I-BGP entity should setup the
   peering relationship with other 4over6 PE routers on the edge of IPv6
   backbone.  The 4over6 I-BGP should have the 4over6 capability defined
   in the above section.  However, the routing among the PE routers in
   inter-AS scenario is more complicated than the intra-AS case.  The
   methods in [RFC4364] can be leveraged to support softwire signaling,
   routing and encapsulation across inter-AS topologies.Anyway a light-
   weighted solution is mostly prefered to solve the problem.  This
   document just addresses the routing issue among PE routers in the
   same AS.

6.1  Receiving routing information from CE

   When a 4over6 PE router learns routing information about the local
   edge network, the 4over6 I-BGP entity should have following
   functions.

   1.  The 4over6 I-BGP entity should maintain the local IPv4 routing
       information it learns from the local IPv4 access network or
       configuration.

   2.  Construct new items in local encapsulation table.  IPv4
       destination should be set with proper prefix with the local IPv4
       routing information it learns.  The PE router uses the IPv6
       address on its 4over6 VIF to set the advertising router.

   3.  The 4over6 I-BGP entity should broadcast the local IPv4 routing
       information to its peers by BGP-MP with 4over6 BGP extension.

       *  Taking AFI as AFI_IP4=1 and SAFI as SAFI_4OVER6 = 67.

       *  Destination network address should be the original destination
          IPv4 network address.

       *  Nexthop should be the IPv6 address of its 4over6 virtual
          interface.

6.2  Receiving routing information from PE

   For a local PE running 4over6 I-BGP protocol, if the remote peering
   PE learns new routing information from static configuration or
   dynamic routing protocol from its local CEs, the remote peering PE
   will send the corresponding routing information to the local one.
   Then, the local PE will process the routing information as follows.

   1.  Confirm the type of received routing information.

       *  Confirm AFI as AFI_IP4=1;

       *  Confirm SAFI as SAFI_4OVER6 = 67;

       *  Confirm destination in NLRI is in IPv4 AF;

       *  Confirm the next hop is in IPv6 AF.

   2.  Add new items in the encapsulation table

       *  Use the destination network address as the received original
          destination IPv4 network address;

       *  Set the corresponding advertising router as the Next Hop field
          in the BGP UPDATE message.

   3.  Add a new routing item in the IPv4 routing table

       *  Use the destination network address as the received original
          destination IPv4 network address;

       *  Set the Next Hop as N/A.

       *  Set the OUTPUT IF as the 4over6 virtual interface on the PE
          router.

7.  4over6 Error Processing

   Because 4over6 reuses existing encapsulation technologies, Error
   Processing should be also reused as much as possible.  In the data
   plane of packet forwarding process, error reporting and processing
   should be refered to [RFC2473].  In the control plane of I-BGP
   peering communication, error reporting and processing should be
   refered to [RFC4271].

   Figure 6: 4over6 implementation network topology

   This implementation and deployment is just to test the function and
   prove the efficiency of 4over6 technology.  There are some IPv4
   access networks, which run only IPv4 stack, equiped with some server
   and client running different applications.  CERNET2 is the transit
   core running only IPv6 protocol.  Just as the figure shows that some
   IPv4 access networks are conneted to both IPv6 and IPv4 networks and
   others are only connected to IPv6 backbones.  In our deployment users
   in different IPv4 networks can communicate with each other through
   4over6 softwire mechanism or just ordinary IPv4 network.

9.  Extension to IPv6 over IPv4

   From the technical view the 4over6 mechanism does not involve any
   IPv4/v6 address translation techniques such as IPv4-embeded IPv6
   address or manual configuration.  Therefore, it can be extended
   smoothly for the IPv6 over IPv4 scenarios in which the existing IPv4
   networks act as the transit core to connected the IPv6 islands.  The
   only defference is that the AFI field should be set as AFI_IP6=2
   since in the UPDATE massage the carried destination prefix is IPv6
   networks.  The SAFI can just use the SAFI_4OVER6=67 to indicate the
   capability of the BGP entity.

10.  IANA Considerations

   In order to indicate the capability of 4over6 in the OPEN message,
   4over6 mechanism need a Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI).
   As SAFI was allocated in a FCFS policy for number 64-128, SAFI value
   67 was assigned by IANA for 4over6 BGP extension : SAFI_4OVER6.

11.  Security Considerations

   Tunneling mechanisms, especially automatic ones, often have potential
   problems of DDoS attacks on the tunnel-entry point or tunnel-end
   point.  However, since 4over6 BGP extension don't allocate resources
   to a particular flow or maintain the state of a particular flow, the
   4over6 PE routers will have a capacity of enduring DDoS attacks as a
   common router.  I-BGP peering relationship may be maintained over
   IPSec or other security communications.

12.  Changes from -00

   1.  Remove the confusion of figure number.

   2.  Revising the figure for the encapsulation table

   3.  Changing the AFI field to AFI_IPV4 =1, as the UPDATE massage
       carries the IPv4 NLRI  information.

   4.  Adding the some discussion about the inter-AS consideration and
       RFC4364  is added as a reference .

   5.  Describing the fact that SAFI values 67 has been assigned by IANA
       for 4over6 BGP extension: SAFI_4OVER6

   6.  Adding two new section about the deloyment of 4over6 mechanism
       and the extension to IPv6 over IPv4.

   7.  Revising the format of MP_REACH_NLRI attribut according to
       [I-D.ietf-idr-rfc2858bis].

   8.  Further linguistic clarificatons and edits

13.  Conclusion

   Due to the rapid deployment of IPv6 networks, especially IPv6
   backbones, these IPv6 backbones may need to provide the access of
   existing IPv4 networks to support long lived IPv4 applications as
   IPv6 transit core.  For the complex IPv4/v6 interconnection, this
   document describes an automatic tunnel endpoint discovery for
   transmission of IPv4 over IPv6 by BGP 4over6 extensions.  The
   provider core routers (P router) only runs with native IPv6, and the
   provider edge (PE) router runs in dual stacks.  In the control plane,
   4over6 PE router maintains an I-BGP peering relationship with each
   other, and sends the routing information of local IPv4 access network
   to other peers.  In the data plane, PE router encapsulates local IPv4
   packets and decapsulates the tunnel packet to its original IPv4
   format to its destination IPv4 networks.  Therefore, this 4over6
   solution with 4over6 BGP extensions only needs to enhance the 4over6
   functionality on the PE routers, while there is no need to change P
   routers and custom routers.
