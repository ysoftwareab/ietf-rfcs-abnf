ImageWidth = 1728, 2048, 2432, 2592, 3072, 3648, 3456, 4096, 4864.
           SHORT or LONG.  These are the fixed page widths in pixels.  The
           permissible values are dependent upon X and Y resolutions as
           shown in sections 2 and 3 of [T.4] and reproduced here for
           convenience:
           
            XResolution x Yresolution                 | ImageWidth
           -------------------------------------------|------------------
            204 x 98, 204 x 196, 200 x 100, 200 x 200 | 1728, 2048, 2432
            300 x 300                                 | 2592, 3072, 3648
            406 x 392, 400 x 400                      | 3456, 4096, 4864
           -------------------------------------------|------------------
           
           Historical TIFF-F did not include support for the following
           widths related to higher resolutions:  2592, 3072, 3648, 3456,
           4096 and 4864.   Historical TIFF-F documents also included the
           following values related to A5 and A6 widths:  816 and 1216.
           Per the most recent version of [T.4], A5 and A6 documents are
           no longer supported in Group 3 facsimile, so the related width
           values are now obsolete.  See section 3.8.2 for more
           information on inch/metric equivalencies and other
           implementation details.
           
Compression = 3,4.  SHORT.
           This is a required TIFF-F field.  The permitted values for TIFF-
           F purposes are 3 and 4 as shown.   The default value per
           Baseline TIFF is 1 (Uncompressed), but this value is invalid
           for facsimile images.    Baseline TIFF also permits use of
           value 2 (Modified Huffman encoding), but the data is presented
           in a form which is not byte aligned.  Instead, TIFF-F specifies
           the value 3 for encoding one-dimensional T.4 Modified Huffman
           or 2-dimensional Modified READ data.   The detailed settings
           which apply for T.4 encoded data are specified using the
           T4Options field.  TIFF-F also permits use of the value 4 for
           the compression field, which indicates that the data is coded
           using a [T.6] compression method (i.e the Modified Modified
           READ two-dimensional method). The detailed settings which apply
           for T.6 encoded data are specified using the T6Options field.
           
           Please refer to the definitions of the T4Options and T6Options
           fields in section 3.3, and section 3.8 for more information on
           the encoding of images and conventions used within TIFF-F.
              
PhotometricInterpretation = 0,1.  SHORT.
           This field allows notation of an inverted ("negative") image:
                   0 = normal
                   1 = inverted
       
ResolutionUnit = 2,3.  SHORT.
           The units of measure for resolution:
               2 = Inch
               3 = Centimeter
       
           TIFF-F has traditionally used inch based measures.
       
XResolution = 204, 200, 300, 400, 406 (inches). RATIONAL.
           The horizontal resolution of the TIFF-F image expressed in
           pixels per resolution unit. The values of 200 and 406 have been
           added to the historical TIFF-F values, for consistency with
           [T.30].  Some existing TIFF-F implementations may also support
           values of 77 (cm).  See section 3.8.2 for more information on
           inch/metric equivalencies and other implementation details.
       
YResolution = 98, 196, 100, 200, 300, 392, 400  (inches). RATIONAL.
           The vertical resolution of the TIFF-F image expressed in pixels
           per resolution unit. The values of 100, 200, and 392 have been
           added to the historical TIFF-F values, for consistency with
           [T.30].  Some existing TIFF-F implementations may also support
           values of 77, 38.5 (cm). See section 3.8.2 for more information
           on inch/metric equivalencies and other implementation details.
           
       
BitsPerSample = 1.  SHORT.
           Since TIFF-F  is only used for black-and-white facsimile
           images, the value is  1 (the default) for all files.
           
FillOrder = 1, 2.  SHORT.
           TIFF  F readers must be able to read data in both bit orders,
           but the vast majority of facsimile products store data LSB
           first, exactly as it appears on the telephone line.
                   1 = Most Significant Bit first.
                   2 = Least Significant Bit first.
       
NewSubFileType = 2.  LONG.
           This field is made up of 32 flag bits.  Unused bits are
           expected to be 0 and bit 0 is the low order bit.   Bit 0 is set
           to 0 for TIFF-F.   Bit 1 is always set to 1 for TIFF-F,
           indicating a single page of a multi-page image.  See sections
           3.1.1 and 3.1.2 for more details on the structure of multi-page
           TIFF-F image files.
           
SamplesPerPixel = 1.  SHORT.
           The value of 1 denotes a bi-level, grayscale, or palette color
           image.
     
T4Options = 4,5.  LONG.
           This field is required if the value for the compression field
           has been set to 3.   The values are set as shown below for TIFF-
           F.   For TIFF-F, uncompressed data is not allowed and EOLs are
           byte aligned.
                  bit 0 = 0 for 1-Dimensional, 1 for 2-Dimensional (MR)
                  bit 1 = must be 0 (uncompressed data not allowed)
                  bit 2 = 1 for byte-aligned EOLs
           
           Bit 0 is the low order bit.  Please note that T4Options was
           known as G3Options in earlier versions of TIFF and TIFF-F.
           The data in a TIFF-F image encoded using one of the T.4 methods
           is not terminated with an RTC (see 3.8.5).
       
T6Options = 0  LONG.
           This field is required for TIFF  F if value of the compression
           field has been set to 4. The value for this field is made up of
           a set of 32 flag bits.   Setting bit 0 to 0 indicates that the
           data is compressed using the Modified Modified READ (MMR) two-
           dimensional compression method.  MMR compressed Data is two-
           dimensional and does not use EOLs. Each MMR encoded image
           should include an "end-of-facsimile-block" (EOFB) code at the
           end of each coded strip (see 3.8.6). Uncompressed data is not
           applicable for bi-level facsimile images, so that bit 1 must be
                  
           set to 0.  Unused bits must be set to 0. Bit 0 is the low-order
           bit. The default value is 0 (all bits 0).
           
                  bit 0 = 0 for 2-Dimensional
                  bit 1 = must be 0 (uncompressed data not allowed)
       
           In earlier versions of TIFF, this field was named
           Group4Options. The significance has not changed and the present
           definition is compatible.

           are actually in the data or if the receiving facsimile device
           replaced them with regenerated lines.
                0 = Data contains no lines with incorrect pixel counts or
                    regenerated lines (i.e., computer generated)
                1 = Lines with an incorrect pixel count were regenerated
                    by receiving device

                    and were not regenerated by receiving device (i.e. data
                    contains bad scan lines)
