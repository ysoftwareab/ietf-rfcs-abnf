                Integrated Routing and Bridging in EVPN 
          draft-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-inter-subnet-forwarding-05 


Abstract

   EVPN provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution
   for intra-subnet connectivity among hosts/VMs over an MPLS/IP
   network. However, there are scenarios in which inter-subnet
   forwarding among hosts/VMs across different IP subnets is required,
   while maintaining the multi-homing capabilities of EVPN. This
   document describes an Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB) solution
   based on EVPN to address such requirements.

INTERNET DRAFT   Integrated Routing & Bridging in EVPN   October 2, 2014


1  Introduction

   EVPN provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution
   for intra-subnet connectivity among Tenant Systems (TS's) over an
   MPLS/IP network. However, there are scenarios where, in addition to
   intra-subnet forwarding, inter-subnet forwarding is required among
   TS's across different IP subnets at the EVPN PE nodes, also known as
   EVPN NVE nodes throughout this document, while maintaining the multi-
   homing capabilities of EVPN. This document describes an Integrated
   Routing and Bridging (IRB) solution based on EVPN to address such
   requirements.

   The inter-subnet communication is traditionally achieved at
   centralized L3 Gateway nodes where all the inter-subnet communication
   policies are enforced. When two Tenant Systems (TS's) belonging to
   two different subnets connected to the same PE node wanted to talk to
   each other, their traffic needed to be back hauled from the PE node
   all the way to the centralized gateway nodes where inter-subnet
   switching is performed and then back to the PE node. For today's
   large multi-tenant data center, this scheme is very inefficient and
   sometimes impractical.  

   In order to overcome the drawback of centralized approach, IRB
   functionality is needed on the PE nodes (i.e., NVE devices) as close
   to TS as possible to avoid hair pinning of user traffic
   unnecessarily.  Under this design, all traffic between hosts attached
   to one NVE can be routed and bridged locally, thus avoiding traffic
   hair-pinning issue at the centralized L3GW. 

   There can be scenarios where both centralized and decentralized
   approaches may be preferred simultaneously. For example, to allow
   NVEs to switch inter-subnet traffic belonging to one tenant or one
   security zone locally; whereas, to back haul inter-subnet traffic
   belonging to two different tenants or security zones to the
   centralized gateway nodes and perform switching there after the
   traffic is subjected to Firewall or Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). 

   Some TS's run non-IP protocols in conjunction with their IP traffic.
   Therefore, it is important to handle both kinds of traffic optimally
   - e.g., to bridge non-IP traffic and to route IP traffic.

   Therefore, the solution needs to meet the following requirements:

   R1: The solution MUST allow for inter-subnet traffic to be locally
   switched at NVEs.

   R2: The solution MUST allow for both inter-subnet and intra-subnet
   traffic belonging to the same tenant to be locally routed and bridged

INTERNET DRAFT   Integrated Routing & Bridging in EVPN   October 2, 2014


   respectively. The solution MUST provide IP routing for inter-subnet
   traffic and Ethernet Bridging for intra-subnet traffic.

   R3: The solution MUST support bridging of non-IP traffic.

   R4: The solution MUST allow inter-subnet switching to be disabled on
   a per VLAN basis on NVEs where the traffic needs to be back hauled to
   another node (e.g., for performing FW or DPI functionality).  


2  Inter-Subnet Forwarding Scenarios 

   The inter-subnet forwarding scenarios performed by an EVPN NVE can be
   divided into the following five categories. The last scenario, along
   with their corresponding solutions, are described in [EVPN-IPVPN-
   INTEROP]. The solutions for the first four scenarios are the focus of
   this document.  

   1. Switching among EVIs (subnets) within a DC

   2. Switching among EVIs (subnets) in different DCs without route
   aggregation

   3. Switching among  EVIs (subnets) in different DCs with route
   aggregation

   4. Switching among  IP-VPN instance and EVIs with route aggregation

   5. Switching among IP-VPN instance and EVIs without route aggregation


   In the above scenario, the term "route aggregation" refers to the
   case where a node situated at the WAN edge of the data center network
   behaves as a default gateway for all the destinations that are
   outside the data center. The absence of route aggregation refers to
   the scenario where NVEs within a data center maintain individual
   (host) routes that are outside of the data center.

   In the case (4), the WAN edge node also performs route aggregation
   for all the destinations within its own data center, and acts as an
   interworking unit between EVPN and IP VPN (it implements both EVPN
   and IP VPN functionality).

                  Figure 2: Interoperability Use-Cases

   In what follows, we will describe scenarios 3 through 6 in more
   detail.

2.1 Switching among Subnets within a DC

   In this scenario, connectivity is required between TS's in the same
   data center, where those hosts belong to different IP subnets. All
   these subnets belong to the same tenant or are part of the same IP
   VPN. Each subnet is associated with a single EVPN instance (EVI)
   realized by a collection of MAC-VRFs (one per NVE) residing on the
   NVEs configured for that EVI.

   As an example, consider TS3 and TS5 of Figure 2 above. Assume that
   connectivity is required between these two TS's where TS3 belongs to
   the IP-subnet 3 (SN3) whereas TS5 belongs to the IP-subnet 5 (SN5).
   Both SN3 and SN5 subnets belong to the same tenant (e.g., are part of
   the same IP VPN). NVE2 has an EVI3 associated with the SN3 and this
   EVI is represented by a MAC-VRF which is associated with an IP-VRF
   (for that IP VPN) via an IRB interface. NVE3 respectively has an EVI5
   associated with the SN5 and this EVI is represented by an MAC-VRF
   which is associated with  an IP-VRF (for the same IP VPN) via an IRB
   interface.

INTERNET DRAFT   Integrated Routing & Bridging in EVPN   October 2, 2014


2.2 Switching among EVIs in different DCs without route aggregation

   This case is similar to that of section 2.1 above albeit for the fact
   that the TS's belong to different data centers that are
   interconnected over a WAN (e.g. MPLS/IP PSN). The data centers in
   question here are seamlessly interconnected to the WAN, i.e., the WAN
   edge devices do not maintain any TS-specific addresses in the
   forwarding path - e.g., there is no WAN edge GW(s) between these DCs.

   As an example, consider TS3 and TS6 of Figure 2 above. Assume that
   connectivity is required between these two TS's where TS3 belongs to
   the SN3 whereas TS6 belongs to the SN6. NVE2 has an EVI3 associated
   with SN3 and NVE4 has an EVI6 associated with the SN6. Both SN3 and
   SN6 are part of the same IP VPN.


2.3 Switching among EVIs in different DCs with route aggregation

   In this scenario, connectivity is required between TS's in different
   data centers, and those hosts belong to different IP subnets. What
   makes this case different from that of Section 2.2 is that (in the
   context of a given IP-VRF) at least one of the data centers in
   question has a gateway as the WAN edge switch. Because of that, the
   NVE's IP-VRF  within each data center need not maintain (host) routes
   to individual TS's outside of the data center.

   As an example, consider TS1 and TS5 of Figure 2 above. Assume that
   connectivity is required between these two TS's where TS1 belongs to
   the SN1 whereas TS5 belongs to the SN5 thus SN1 and SN5 belong to the
   same IP VPN. NVE3 has an EVI5 associated with the SN5 and this EVI is
   represented by the MAC-VRF which is connected to the IP-VRF via an
   IRB interface. NVE1 has an EVI1 associated with the SN1 and this EVI
   is represented by the MAC-VRF which is connected to the IP-VRF
   representing the same IP VPN. Due to the gateway at the edge of DCN
   1, NVE1's IP-VRF does not need to have the address of TS5 but instead
   it has a default route in its IP-VRF with the next-hop being the GW.

2.4 Switching among IP-VPN sites and EVIs with route aggregation

   In this scenario, connectivity is required between TS's in a data
   center and hosts in an enterprise site that belongs to a given IP-
   VPN. The NVE within the data center is an EVPN NVE, whereas the
   enterprise site has an IP-VPN PE. Furthermore, the data center in
   question has a gateway as the WAN edge switch. Because of that, the
   NVE in the data center does not need to maintain individual IP
   prefixes advertised by enterprise sites (by IP-VPN PEs).

   As an example, consider end-station H1 and TS2 of Figure 2. Assume
 


Sajassi et al.           Expires April 2, 2015                  [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT   Integrated Routing & Bridging in EVPN   October 2, 2014


   that connectivity is required between the end-station and the TS,
   where TS2 belongs to the SN2 that is realized using EVPN, whereas H1
   belongs to an IP VPN site connected to PE1 (PE1 maintains an IP-VRF
   associated with that IP VPN). NVE1 has an EVI2 associated with the
   SN2. Moreover, EVI2 on NVE1 is connected to an IP-VRF associated with
   that IP VPN.  PE1 originates a VPN-IP route that covers H1. The
   gateway at the edge of DCN1 performs interworking function between
   IP-VPN and EVPN.  As a result of this, a default route in the IP-VRF
   on the NVE1, pointing to the gateway as the next hop, and a route to
   the TS2  (or maybe SN2) on the PE1's IP-VRF are sufficient for the
   connectivity between H1 and TS2. In this scenario, the NVE1's IP-VRF
   does not need to maintain a route to H1 because it has the default
   route to the gateway.

3 Default L3 Gateway Addressing

3.1 Homogeneous Environment

   This is an environment where all NVEs to which an EVPN instance could
   potentially be attached (or moved), perform inter-subnet switching. 
   Therefore, inter-subnet traffic can be locally switched by the EVPN
   NVE connecting the TS's belonging to different subnets.   

   To support such inter-subnet forwarding, the NVE behaves as an IP
   Default Gateway from the perspective of the attached TS's. Two models
   are possible:

   1. All the NVEs of a given EVPN instance use the same anycast default
   gateway IP address and the same anycast default gateway MAC address.
   On each NVE, this default gateway IP/MAC address correspond to the
   IRB interface of the MAC-VRF associated with that EVI. 

   2. Each NVE of a given EVPN instance uses its own default gateway IP
   and MAC addresses, and these addresses are aliased to the same
   conceptual gateway through the use of the Default Gateway extended
   community as specified in [EVPN], which is carried in the EVPN MAC
   Advertisement routes. On each NVE, this default gateway IP/MAC
   address correspond to the IRB interface of the MAC-VRF associated
   with that EVI.

   Both of these models enable a packet forwarding paradigm for
   asymmetric IRB forwarding where a packet can bypass the IP-VRF
   processing on the egress (i.e. disposition) NVE. The egress NVE
   merely needs to perform a lookup in the associated MAC-VRF and
   forward the Ethernet frames unmodified, i.e. without rewriting the
   source MAC address.  This is different from symmetric IRB forwarding
   where a packet is forwarded through the MAC-VRF followed by the IP-
   VRF on the ingress NVE, and then forwarded through the IP-VRF
 


Sajassi et al.           Expires April 2, 2015                  [Page 8]

INTERNET DRAFT   Integrated Routing & Bridging in EVPN   October 2, 2014


   followed by the MAC-VRF on the egress NVE. 

   It is worth noting that if the applications that are running on the
   TS's are employing or relying on any form of MAC security, then the
   first model (i.e. using anycast addresses) would be required to
   ensure that the applications receive traffic from the same source MAC
   address that they are sending to.

3.2 Heterogeneous Environment

   For large data centers with thousands of servers and ToR (or Access)
   switches, some of them may not have the capability of maintaining or
   enforcing policies for inter-subnet switching. Even though policies
   among multiple subnets belonging to same tenant can be simpler, hosts
   belonging to one tenant can also send traffic to peers belonging to
   different tenants or security zones. A L3GW not only needs to enforce
   policies for communication among subnets belonging to a single
   tenant, but also it needs to know how to handle traffic destined
   towards peers in different tenants. Therefore, there can be a mixed
   environment where an NVE performs inter-subnet switching for some
   EVPN instances but not others.   


4  Operational Models for Asymmetric Inter-Subnet Forwarding


4.1 Among EVPN NVEs within a DC

   When an EVPN MAC advertisement route is received by the NVE, the IP
   address associated with the route is used to populate the IP-VRF
   table, whereas the MAC address associated with the route is used to
   populate both the MAC-VRF table, as well as the adjacency associated
   with the IP route in the IP-VRF table. 

   When an Ethernet frame is received by an ingress NVE, it performs a
   lookup on the destination MAC address in the associated MAC-VRF for
   that EVI. If the MAC address corresponds to its IRB Interface MAC
   address, the ingress NVE deduces that the packet MUST be inter-subnet
   routed. Hence, the ingress NVE performs an IP lookup in the
   associated IP-VRF table. The lookup identifies both the next-hop
   (i.e. egress) NVE to which the packet must be forwarded, in addition
   to an adjacency that contains a MAC rewrite and an MPLS label stack.
   The MAC rewrite holds the MAC address associated with the destination
   host (as populated by the EVPN MAC route), instead of the MAC address

   MAC address in the packet with the address specified in the
   adjacency. It also rewrites the source MAC address with its IRB
   Interface MAC address. The ingress NVE, then, forwards the frame to

   the next-hop (i.e. egress) NVE after encapsulating it with the MPLS
   label stack. Note that this label stack includes the LSP label as
   well as the EVPN label that was advertised by the egress NVE. When
   the MPLS encapsulated packet is received by the egress NVE, it uses
   the EVPN label to identify the MAC-VRF table. It then performs a MAC
   lookup in that table, which yields the outbound interface to which
   the Ethernet frame must be forwarded. Figure 2 below depicts the
   packet flow, where NVE1 and NVE2 are the ingress and egress NVEs,
   respectively.

     Figure 2: Inter-Subnet Forwarding Among EVPN NVEs within a DC

   Note that the forwarding behavior on the egress NVE is similar to
   EVPN intra-subnet forwarding. In other words, all the packet
   processing associated with the inter-subnet forwarding semantics is
   confined to the ingress NVE and that is why it is called Asymmetric
   IRB.

   It should also be noted that [EVPN] provides different level of
   granularity for the EVPN label.  Besides identifying bridge domain
   table, it can be used to identify the egress interface or a
   destination MAC address on that interface. If EVPN label is used for
   egress interface or destination MAC address identification, then no
   MAC lookup is needed in the egress EVI and the packet can be directly
   forwarded to the egress interface just based on EVPN label lookup. 

4.2 Among EVPN NVEs in Different DCs Without Route Aggregation

   When an EVPN MAC advertisement route is received by the NVE, the IP
   address associated with the route is used to populate the IP-VRF
   table, whereas the MAC address associated with the route is used to
   populate both the MAC-VRF table, as well as the adjacency associated
   with the IP route in the IP-VRF table. 

   When an Ethernet frame is received by an ingress NVE, it performs a

   lookup on the destination MAC address in the associated EVI. If the
   MAC address corresponds to its IRB Interface MAC address, the ingress
   NVE deduces that the packet MUST be inter-subnet routed. Hence, the
   ingress NVE performs an IP lookup in the associated IP-VRF table. The
   lookup identifies both the next-hop (i.e. egress) Gateway to which
   the packet must be forwarded, in addition to an adjacency that
   contains a MAC rewrite and an MPLS label stack. The MAC rewrite holds
   the MAC address associated with the destination host (as populated by
   the EVPN MAC route), instead of the MAC address of the next-hop
   Gateway. The ingress NVE then rewrites the destination MAC address in
   the packet with the address specified in the adjacency. It also
   rewrites the source MAC address with its IRB Interface MAC address.
   The ingress NVE, then, forwards the frame to the next-hop (i.e.
   egress) Gateway after encapsulating it with the MPLS label stack. 

   Note that this label stack includes the LSP label as well as an EVPN
   label. The EVPN label could be either advertised by the ingress
   Gateway, if inter-AS option B is used, or advertised by the egress
   NVE, if inter-AS option C is used. When the MPLS encapsulated packet
   is received by the ingress Gateway, the processing again differs
   depending on whether inter-AS option B or option C is employed: in
   the former case, the ingress Gateway swaps the EVPN label in the
   packets with the EVPN label value received from the egress Gateway.
   In the latter case, the ingress Gateway does not modify the EVPN
   label and performs normal label switching on the LSP label. 
   Similarly on the egress Gateway, for option B, the egress Gateway
   swaps the EVPN label with the value advertised by the egress NVE.
   Whereas, for option C, the egress Gateway does not modify the EVPN
   label, and performs normal label switching on the LSP label. When the
   MPLS encapsulated packet is received by the egress NVE, it uses the
   EVPN label to identify the bridge-domain table. It then performs a
   MAC lookup in that table, which yields the outbound interface to
   which the Ethernet frame must be forwarded. Figure 3 below depicts
   the packet flow.

4.3 Among EVPN NVEs in Different DCs with Route Aggregation

   In this scenario, the NVEs within a given data center do not have
   entries for the MAC/IP addresses of hosts in remote data centers.
   Rather, the NVEs have a default IP route pointing to the WAN gateway
   for each VRF. This is accomplished by the WAN gateway advertising for
   a given EVPN that spans multiple DC a default VPN-IP route that is
   imported by the NVEs of that EVPN that are in the gateway's own DC.

   When an Ethernet frame is received by an ingress NVE, it performs a
   lookup on the destination MAC address in the associated MAC-VRF
   table. If the MAC address corresponds to the IRB Interface MAC
   address, the ingress NVE deduces that the packet MUST be inter-subnet
   routed. Hence, the ingress NVE performs an IP lookup in the
   associated IP-VRF table. The lookup, in this case, matches the
   default route which points to the local WAN gateway. The ingress NVE
   then rewrites the destination MAC address in the packet with the IRB
   Interface MAC address of the local WAN gateway. It also rewrites the
   source MAC address with its own IRB Interface MAC address. The
   ingress NVE, then, forwards the frame to the WAN gateway after
   encapsulating it with the MPLS label stack. Note that this label
   stack includes the LSP label as well as the IP-VPN label that was
   advertised by the local WAN gateway. When the MPLS encapsulated
   packet is received by the local WAN gateway, it uses the IP-VPN label
   to identify the IP-VRF table. It then performs an IP lookup in that
   table. The lookup identifies both the remote WAN gateway (of the
   remote data center) to which the packet must be forwarded, in
   addition to an adjacency that contains a MAC rewrite and an MPLS
   label stack. The MAC rewrite holds the MAC address associated with
   the ultimate destination host (as populated by the EVPN MAC route).
   The local WAN gateway then rewrites the destination MAC address in
   the packet with the address specified in the adjacency. It also
   rewrites the source MAC address with its IRB Interface MAC address.

   The local WAN gateway, then, forwards the frame to the remote WAN
   gateway after encapsulating it with the MPLS label stack. Note that
   this label stack includes the LSP label as well as a EVPN label that
   was advertised by the remote WAN gateway. When the MPLS encapsulated
   packet is received by the remote WAN gateway, it simply swaps the
   EVPN label and forwards the packet to the egress NVE. This implies
   that the GW1 needs to keep the remote host MAC addresses along with
   the corresponding EVPN labels in the adjacency entries of the IP-VRF
   table. The remote WAN gateway then forward the packet to the egress
   NVE. The egress NVE then performs a MAC lookup in the MAC-VRF
   (identified by the received EVPN label) to determine the outbound
   port to send the traffic on.

   ingress NVE, then, forwards the frame to the local WAN gateway after
   encapsulating it with the MPLS label stack. Note that this label
   stack includes the LSP label as well as the IP-VPN label that was
   advertised by the local WAN gateway. When the MPLS encapsulated
   packet is received by the local WAN gateway, it uses the IP-VPN label
   to identify the VRF table. It then performs an IP lookup in that
   table. The lookup identifies the next hop ASBR to which the packet
   must be forwarded. The local gateway in this case strips the Ethernet
   encapsulation and perform an IP lookup in its IP-VRF and forwards the
   IP packet to the ASBR using a label stack comprising of an LSP label
   and an IP-VPN label that was advertised by the ASBR. When the MPLS
   encapsulated packet is received by the ASBR, it simply swaps the IP-
   VPN label with the one advertised by the egress PE. This implies that
   the remote WAN gateway must allocate the VPN label at least at the
   granularity of a (VRF, egress PE) tuple. The ASBR then forwards the
   packet to the egress PE. The egress PE then performs an IP lookup in
   the IP-VRF (identified by the received IP-VPN label) to determine
   where to forward the traffic.

4.5 Use of Centralized Gateway

   In this scenario, the NVEs within a given data center need to forward
   traffic in L2 to a centralized L3GW for a number of reasons: a) they
   don't have IRB capabilities or b) they don't have required policy for
   switching traffic between different tenants or security zones. The
   centralized L3GW performs both the IRB function for switching traffic
   among different EVPN instances as well as it performs interworking
   function when the traffic needs to be switched between IP-VPN sites
   and EVPN instances.

5 Operational Models for Symmetric Inter-Subnet Forwarding

   The following sections describe several main symmetric IRB forwarding
   scenarios.

5.1 IRB forwarding on NVEs for Tenant Systems

   This section covers the symmetric IRB procedures for the scenario
   where each Tenant System (TS) is attached to one or more NVEs and its
   host IP and MAC addresses are learned by the attached NVEs and are
   distributed to all other NVEs that are interested in participating in
   both intra-subnet and inter-subnet communications with that TS.

   In this scenario, for a given tenant (e.g., an IP-VPN service), an
   NVE has one MAC-VRF for each tenant's subnet (VLAN) that is
   configured for. Assuming VLAN-based service which is typically the
   case for VxLAN and NVGRE encapsulation, each MAC-VRF consists of a
   single bridge domain. In case of MPLS encapsulation with VLAN-aware
   bundling, then each MAC-VRF consists of multiple bridge domains (one
   bridge domain per VLAN). The MAC-VRFs on an NVE for a given tenant
   are associated with an IP-VRF corresponding to that tenant (or IP-VPN
   service) via their IRB interfaces. 

   Each NVE MUST support QoS, Security, and OAM policies per IP-VRF
   to/from the core network. This is not to be confused with the QoS,
   Security, and OAM policies per Attachment Circuits (AC) to/from the
   Tenant Systems. How this requirement is met is an implementation
   choice and it is outside the scope of this document.  

   Since VxLAN and NVGRE encapsulations require inner Ethernet header
   (inner MAC SA/DA), and since for inter-subnet traffic, TS MAC address
   cannot be used, the ingress NVE's MAC address is used as inner MAC
   SA. The NVE's MAC address is the device MAC address and it is common
   across all MAC-VRFs and IP-VRFs. This MAC address is advertised using
   the new EVPN Router's MAC Extended Community (section 6.1).

   Figure below illustrates this scenario where a given tenant (e.g., an
   IP-VPN service) has three subnets represented by MAC-VRF1, MAC-VRF2,
   and MAC-VRF3 across two NVEs. There are five TS's that are associated
   with these three MAC-VRFs - i.e., TS1, TS5 are associated with MAC-
   VRF1 on NVE1, TS4 is associated with MAC-VRF1 on NVE2,  TS2 is
   associated with MAC-VRF2 on NVE1, and TS3 is associated with MAC-VRF3
   on NVE2. MAC-VRF1 and MAC-VRF2 on NVE1 are in turn associated with
   IP-VRF1 on NVE1 and MAC-VRF1 and MAC-VRF3 on NVE2 are associated with
   IP-VRF1 on NVE2. When TS1, TS5, and TS4 exchange traffic with each
   other, only L2 forwarding (bridging) part of the IRB solution is
   exercised because all these TS's sit on the same subnet. However,
   when TS1 wants to exchange traffic with TS2 or TS3 which belong to

   different subnets, then both bridging and routing parts of the IRB
   solution are exercised. The following subsections describe the
   control and data planes operations for this IRB scenario in details.

   Figure 6: IRB forwarding on NVEs without core-facing IRB Interface

5.1.1 Control Plane Operation

   Each NVE advertises a Route Type-2 (RT-2, MAC/IP Advertisement Route)
   for each of its TS's with the following field set:

   - RD and ESI per [EVPN]
   - Ethernet Tag = 0; assuming VLAN-based service
   - MAC Address Length = 48
   - MAC Address = Mi ; where i = 1,2,3,4, or 5 in the above example
   - IP Address Length = 32 or 128
   - IP Address = IPi ; where i = 1,2,3,4, or 5 in the above example
   - Label-1 = MPLS Label or VNID corresponding to MAC-VRF
   - Label-2 = MPLS Label or VNID corresponding to IP-VRF 

   Each NVE advertises an RT-2 route with two Route Targets (one
   corresponding to its MAC-VRF and the other corresponding to its IP-
   VRF. Furthermore, the RT-2 is advertised with two BGP Extended
   Communities. The first BGP Extended Community identifies the tunnel
   type per section 4.5 of [RFC5512] and the second BGP Extended
   Community includes the MAC address of the NVE (e.g., MACx for NVE1 or
   MACy for NVE2) and it is defined in section 6.1. This second Extended
   Community (for the MAC address of NVE) is only required when the
   tunnel encapsulation is of type VxLAN or NVGRE where an inner MAC
   address is needed. 

   Upon receiving this advertisement, the receiving NVE performs the
 


Sajassi et al.           Expires April 2, 2015                 [Page 16]

INTERNET DRAFT   Integrated Routing & Bridging in EVPN   October 2, 2014


   following:

   - It uses Route Targets corresponding to its MAC-VRF and IP-VRF for
   identifying these tables and subsequently importing this route into
   them.

   - It imports the MAC address into the MAC-VRF with BGP Next Hop
   address as underlay tunnel destination address (e.g., VTEP DA for
   VxLAN encapsulation) and Label-1 as VNID for VxLAN encapsulation or
   EVPN label for MPLS encapsulation.

   - If the route carries the new Router's MAC Extended Community, and
   if the receiving NVE is going to use VxLAN encapsulation, then the
   receiving NVE imports the IP address into IP-VRF with NVE's MAC
   address (from the new Router's MAC Extended Community) as inner MAC
   DA and BGP Next Hop address as underlay tunnel destination address,
   VTEP DA for VxLAN encapsulation and Label-2 as IP-VPN VNID for VxLAN
   encapsulation.

   - If the receiving NVE is going to use MPLS encapsulation, then the
   receiving NVE imports the IP address into IP-VRF with BGP Next Hop
   address as underlay tunnel destination address, and Label-2 as IP-VPN
   label for MPLS encapsulation.

   If the receiving NVE receives a RT-2 with only a single Route Target
   corresponding to IP-VRF and Label-1, then it must discard this route
   and log an error. If the receiving NVE receives a RT-2 with only a
   single Route Target corresponding to MAC-VRF but with both Label-1
   and Label-2, then it must discard this route and log an error. If the
   receiving NVE receives a RT-2 with MAC Address Length of zero, then
   it must discard this route and log an error.


5.1.2 Data Plane Operation

   The following description of the data-plane operation describes just
   the logical functions and the actual implementation may differ. Lets
   consider data-plane operation when TS1 in subnet-1 (MAC-VRF1) on NVE1
   wants to send traffic to TS3 in subnet-3 (MAC-VRF3) on NVE2.

   - TS1 send a packet with MAC DA corresponding to the MAC-VRF1 IRB
   interface on NVE1 (the interface between MAC-VRF1 and IP-VRF1), and
   VLAN-tag corresponding to MAC-VRF1.

   - Upon receiving the packet, the NVE1 uses VLAN-tag to identify the
   MAC-VRF1. It then looks up the MAC DA and forwards the frame to its
   IRB interface.

INTERNET DRAFT   Integrated Routing & Bridging in EVPN   October 2, 2014


   -  The Ethernet header of the packet is stripped and the packet is
   fed to the IP-VRF (iVRF) where IP lookup is performed on the
   destination address. This lookup yields a MAC address to be used as
   inner MAC DA for VxLAN/NVGRE encapsulation, an IP address to be used
   as VTEP DA for VxLAN encap or tunnel label for MPLS encap, and a VPN-
   ID to be used as VNID for VxLAN encap or VPN label for MPLS encap.

   -  The packet is then encapsulated with the proper header based on
   the above info. The inner MAC SA and VTEP SA is set to NVE's MAC and
   IP addresses respectively. The packet is then forwarded to the egress
   NVE.

   - On the egress NVE, if the packet is VxLAN encapsulated, the VxLAN
   header is removed. Since the inner MAC DA is the egress NVE's MAC
   address, the egress NVE knows that it needs to perform an IP lookup.
   It uses VNID to identify the IP-VRF (iVRF) table and then performs an
   IP lookup which results in destination TS (TS3) MAC address and the
   access-facing IRB interface over which the packet is sent. 

   - The IP packet is encapsulated with an Ethernet header with MAC SA
   set to that of NVE2 MAC address(MACy) and MAC DA set to that of
   destination TS (TS3) MAC address. The packet is sent to the
   corresponding MAC-VRF3 and after a lookup of MAC DA, is forwarded to
   the destination TS (TS3) over the corresponding interface.  

   In this scenario, inter-subnet forwarding traffic between NVEs will
   always use the IP-VRF VNID/MPLS label, even if the IP DA belongs to a
   subnet defined in both NVEs. For instance, traffic from TS2 to TS4
   will be encapsulated by NVE1 using NVE2's IP-VRF VNID/MPLS label as
   opposed to the MAC-VRF1 VNID/MPLS label, as long as TS4's host IP is
   present in NVE1's IP-VRF. 

5.1.3 TS Move Operation

   When a TS move from one NVE to other, it is important that the MAC
   mobility procedures are properly executed and the corresponding MAC-
   VRF and IP-VRF tables on all participating NVEs are updated. [EVPN]
   describes the MAC mobility procedures for L2-only services for both
   single-homed TS and All-Active multi-homed TS . This section
   describes the incremental procedures and BGP Extended Communities
   needed to handle the MAC mobility for a mixed of L2 and L3 services
   known as Integrated Routing and Bridging - IRB.  In order to place
   the emphasis on the differences between L2-only versus L2-and-L3 use
   cases, the incremental procedure is described for single-homed TS
   with the expectation that the reader can easily extrapolate multi-
   homed TS based on the procedures described in section 15 of [EVPN].

   Lets consider TS1 in figure-6 above where it moves from NVE1 to NVE2.

   In such move, NVE2 discovers IP1/MAC1 of TS1 and realizes that it is
   a MAC move and it advertises a MAC/IP route per section 5.1.1 above
   with MAC Mobility Extended Community. In this IRB use case, both MAC
   and IP addresses of the TS are included in the EVPN MAC/IP
   Advertisement route as oppose to L2-only use case where only the MAC
   address of the TS is included. Furthermore, besides MAC mobility
   Extended Community and Route Target corresponding to the MAC-VRF, the
   following additional BGP Extended Communities are advertised along
   with the MAC/IP Advertisement route:

   	- Route Target associated with IP-VRF
   	- Router's MAC Extended Community
   	- Tunnel Type Extended Community  

   Since NVE2 learns TS1's MAC/IP addresses locally, it updates its MAC-
   VRF1 and IP-VRF1 for TS1 with its local interface.   

   If the local learning at NVE1 is performed using control or
   management planes, then these interactions serve as the trigger for
   NVE1 to withdraw the MAC/IP addresses associated with TS1. However,
   if the local learning at NVE1 is performed using data-plane learning,
   then the reception of the MAC/IP Advertisement route for TS1 with MAC
   Mobility extended community serve as the trigger for NVE1 to withdraw
   the MAC/IP addresses associated with TS1.

   All other remote NVE devices upon receiving the MAC/IP advertisement
   route for TS1 from NVE2 with MAC Mobility extended community compare
   the sequence number in this advertisement with the one previously
   received. If the new sequence number is greater than the old one,
   then they update the MAC/IP addresses of TS1 in their corresponding
   MAC-VRFs and IP-VRFs to point to NVE2. Furthermore, upon receiving
   the MAC/IP withdraw for TS1 from NVE1, these remote PEs perform the
   cleanups for their BGP tables. 


5.2 IRB forwarding on NVEs for Subnets behind Tenant Systems

   This section covers the symmetric IRB procedures for the scenario
   where some Tenant Systems (TS's) support one or more subnets and
   these TS's are associated with one ore more NVEs. Therefore, besides
   the advertisement of MAC/IP addresses for each TS which can be in the
   presence of All-Active multi-homing, the associated NVE needs to also
   advertise the subnets behind each TS. 

   The main difference between this scenario and the previous one is the
   additional advertisement corresponding to each subnet. These subnet
   advertisements are accomplished using EVPN IP Prefix route defined in
   [EVPN-PREFIX]. These subnet prefixes are advertised with the IP

   address of their associated TS (which is in overlay address space) as
   their next hop. The receiving NVEs perform recursive route resolution
   to resolve the subnet prefix with its associated ingress NVE so that
   they know which NVE to forward the packets to when they are destined
   for that subnet prefix. 

   The advantage of this recursive route resolution is that when a TS
   moves from one NVE to another, there is no need to re-advertise any
   of the subnet prefixes for that TS. All it is needed is to advertise
   the IP/MAC addresses associated with the TS itself and exercise MAC
   mobility procedures for that TS. The recursive route resolution
   automatically takes care of the updates for the subnet prefixes of
   that TS. 

   Figure below illustrates this scenario where a given tenant (e.g., an
   IP-VPN service) has three subnets represented by MAC-VRF1, MAC-VRF2,
   and MAC-VRF3 across two NVEs. There are four TS's associated with
   these three MAC-VRFs - i.e., TS1, TS5 are connected to MAC-VRF1 on
   NVE1, TS2 is connected to MAC-VRF2 on NVE1,  TS3 is connected to MAC-
   VRF3 on NVE2, and TS4 is connected to MAC-VRF1 on NVE2. TS1 has two
   subnet prefixes (SN1 and SN2) and TS3 has a single subnet prefix,
   SN3. The MAC-VRFs on each NVE are associated with their corresponding
   IP-VRF using their IRB interfaces. When TS4 and TS1 exchange intra-
   subnet traffic, only L2 forwarding (bridging) part of the IRB
   solution is used (i.e., the traffic only goes through their MAC-
   VRFs); however, when TS4 wants to forward traffic to SN1 or SN2
   sitting behind TS1 (inter-subnet traffic), then both bridging and
   routing parts of the IRB solution are exercised (i.e., the traffic
   goes through the corresponding MAC-VRFs and IP-VRFs). The following
   subsections describe the control and data planes operations for this
   IRB scenario in details.

    Figure 7: IRB forwarding on NVEs with core-facing IRB Interface

5.2.1 Control Plane Operation

   Each NVE advertises a Route Type-5 (RT-5, IP Prefix Route defined in
   [EVPN-PREFIX]) for each of its subnet prefixes with the IP address of
   its TS as the next hop (gateway address field) as follow: 

   - RD per VPN
   - ESI = 0
   - Ethernet Tag = 0;
   - IP Prefix Length = 32 or 128
   - IP Prefix = SNi
   - Gateway Address = IPi; IP address of TS 
   - Label = 0 

   This RT-5 is advertised with a Route Target corresponding to the IP-
   VPN service.

   Each NVE also advertises an RT-2 (MAC/IP Advertisement Route) along
   with their associated Route Targets and Extended Communities for each
   of its TS's exactly as described in section 5.1.1. 

   Upon receiving the RT-5 advertisement, the receiving NVE performs the
   following:

   - It uses the Route Target to identify the corresponding IP-VRF

 


Sajassi et al.           Expires April 2, 2015                 [Page 21]

INTERNET DRAFT   Integrated Routing & Bridging in EVPN   October 2, 2014


   - It imports the IP prefix into its corresponding IP-VRF with the IP
   address of the associated TS as its next hop. 

   Upon receiving the RT-2 advertisement, the receiving NVE imports
   MAC/IP addresses of the TS into the corresponding MAC-VRF and IP-VRF
   per section 5.1.1. Furthermore, it performs recursive route
   resolution to resolve the IP prefix (received in RT-5) to its
   corresponding NVE's IP address (e.g., its BGP next hop). BGP next hop
   will be used as underlay tunnel destination address (e.g., VTEP DA
   for VxLAN encapsulation) and Router's MAC will be used as inner MAC
   for VxLAN encapsulation.    


5.2.2 Data Plane Operation

   The following description of the data-plane operation describes just
   the logical functions and the actual implementation may differ. Lets
   consider data-plane operation when a host on SN1 sitting behind TS1
   wants to send traffic to a host sitting behind SN3 behind TS3.

   - TS1 send a packet with MAC DA corresponding to the MAC-VRF1 IRB
   interface of NVE1, and VLAN-tag corresponding to MAC-VRF1.

   - Upon receiving the packet, the ingress NVE1 uses VLAN-tag to
   identify the MAC-VRF1. It then looks up the MAC DA and forwards the
   frame to its IRB interface just like section 5.1.1.

   - The Ethernet header of the packet is stripped and the packet is fed
   to the IP-VRF; where, IP lookup is performed on the destination
   address. This lookup yields the fields needed for VxLAN encapsulation
   with NVE2's MAC address as the inner MAC DA, NVE'2 IP address as the
   VTEP DA, and the VNID. MAC SA is set to NVE1's MAC address and VTEP
   SA is set to NVE1's IP address.

   -  The packet is then encapsulated with the proper header based on
   the above info and is forwarded to the egress NVE (NVE2).

   - On the egress NVE (NVE2), assuming the packet is VxLAN
   encapsulated, the VxLAN and the inner Ethernet headers are removed
   and the resultant IP packet is fed to the IP-VRF associated with that
   the VNID. 

   - Next, a lookup is performed based on IP DA (which is in SN3) in the
   associated IP-VRF of NVE2. The IP lookup yields the destination TS
   (TS3) MAC address and the access-facing IRB interface over which the
   packet needs to be sent. 

   - The IP packet is encapsulated with an Ethernet header with the MAC

   SA set to that of the access-facing IRB interface of the egress NVE
   (NVE2) and the MAC DA is set to that of destination TS (TS3) MAC
   address. The packet is sent to the corresponding MAC-VRF3 and after a
   lookup of MAC DA, is forwarded to the destination TS (TS3) over the
   corresponding interface.  


6 BGP Encoding

   This document defines one new BGP Extended Community for EVPN.

6.1 Router's MAC Extended Community

   A new EVPN BGP Extended Community called Router's MAC is introduced
   here. This new extended community is a transitive extended community
   with the Type field of 0x06 (EVPN) and the Sub-Type of 0x03. It may
   be advertised along with BGP Encapsulation Extended Community define
   in section 4.5 of [RFC5512]. 

   The Router's MAC Extended Community is encoded as an 8-octet value as
   follows:


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       | Type=0x06     | Sub-Type=0x03 |        Router's MAC           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                      Router's MAC Cont'd                      |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



   This extended community is used to carry the NVE's MAC address for
   symmetric IRB scenarios and it is sent with RT-2 as described in
   section 5.1.1 and 5.2.1. 

7 TS Mobility

7.1 TS Mobility & Optimum Forwarding for TS Outbound Traffic

   Optimum forwarding for the TS outbound traffic, upon TS mobility, can
   be achieved using either the anycast default Gateway MAC and IP
   addresses, or using the address aliasing as discussed in [DC-
   MOBILITY].

7.2 TS Mobility & Optimum Forwarding for TS Inbound Traffic

 


Sajassi et al.           Expires April 2, 2015                 [Page 23]

INTERNET DRAFT   Integrated Routing & Bridging in EVPN   October 2, 2014


   For optimum forwarding of the TS inbound traffic, upon TS mobility,
   all the NVEs and/or IP-VPN PEs need to know the up to date location
   of the TS. Two scenarios must be considered, as discussed next.

   In what follows, we use the following terminology:

   - source NVE refers to the NVE behind which the TS used to reside
   prior to the TS mobility event.

   - target NVE refers to the new NVE behind which the TS has moved
   after the mobility event.

7.2.1 Mobility without Route Aggregation 

   In this scenario, when a target NVE detects that a MAC mobility event
   has occurred, it initiates the MAC mobility handshake in BGP as
   specified in [EVPN]. The WAN Gateways, acting as ASBRs in this case,
   re-advertise the MAC route of the target NVE with the MAC Mobility
   extended community attribute unmodified. Because the WAN Gateway for
   a given data center re-advertises BGP routes received from the WAN
   into the data center, the source NVE will receive the MAC
   Advertisement route of the target NVE (with the next hop attribute
   adjusted depending on which inter-AS option is employed). The source
   NVE will then withdraw its original MAC Advertisement route as a
   result of evaluating the Sequence Number field of the MAC Mobility
   extended community in the received MAC Advertisement route. This is
   per the procedures already defined in [EVPN].

7.2.2 Mobility with Route Aggregation

   This section will be completed in the next revision.
