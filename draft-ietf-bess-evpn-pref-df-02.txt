                   Preference-based EVPN DF Election
                    draft-ietf-bess-evpn-pref-df-02

Abstract

   The Designated Forwarder (DF) in (PBB-)EVPN networks is defined as
   the PE responsible for sending broadcast, multicast and unknown
   unicast traffic (BUM) to a multi-homed device/network in the case of
   an all-active multi-homing ES, or BUM and unicast in the case of
   single-active multi-homing.

   The DF is selected out of a candidate list of PEs that advertise the
   Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI) to the EVPN network, according to
   the Default DF Election algorithm. 

   While the Default Algorithm provides an efficient and automated way
   of selecting the DF across different EVIs or ISIDs in the ES, there
   are some use-cases where a more 'deterministic' and user-controlled
   method is required. At the same time, Service Providers require an
   easy way to force an on-demand DF switchover in order to carry out
   some maintenance tasks on the existing DF or control whether a new
   active PE can preempt the existing DF PE. 

   This document proposes an extension to the Default DF election
   procedures so that the above requirements can be met.

1. Problem Statement

   [RFC7432] defines the Designated Forwarder (DF) in (PBB-)EVPN
   networks as the PE responsible for sending broadcast, multicast and
   unknown unicast traffic (BUM) to a multi-homed device/network in the
   case of an all-active multi-homing ES or BUM and unicast traffic to a
   multi-homed device or network in case of single-active multi-homing.

   The DF is selected out of a candidate list of PEs that advertise the
   Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI) to the EVPN network and according
   to the Alg [DF]. 

   While the Default DF Election Algorithm provides an efficient and
   automated way of selecting the DF across different EVIs or ISIDs in
   the ES, there are some use-cases where a more 'deterministic' and
   user-controlled method is required. At the same time, Service
   Providers require an easy way to force an on-demand DF switchover in
   order to carry out some maintenance tasks on the existing DF or
   control whether a new active PE can preempt the existing DF PE. 

   This document proposes an extension to the current Default DF
   election procedures [RFC7432] so that the above requirements can be
   met.


2. Solution requirements

   This document proposes an extension of the [RFC7432] Default DF
   election Algorithm motivated by the following requirements:

   a) The solution provides an administrative preference option so that
      the user can control in what order the candidate PEs may become
      DF, assuming they are all operationally ready to take over.

   b) This extension works for [RFC7432] Ethernet Segments (ES) and
      virtual ES, as defined in [vES].

Internet-Draft     Preference-based EVPN DF Election    October 22, 2018


   c) The user may force a PE to preempt the existing DF for a given
      EVI/ISID without re-configuring all the PEs in the ES.

   d) The solution allows an option to NOT preempt the current DF, even
      if the former DF PE comes back up after a failure. This is also
      known as "non-revertive" behavior, as opposed to the [RFC7432] DF
      election procedures that are always revertive. 

   e) The solution works for single-active and all-active multi-homing
      Ethernet Segments.


3. EVPN BGP Attributes for Deterministic DF Election

   This solution reuses and extends the DF Election Extended Community
   defined in [DF] that is advertised along with the ES route:


    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   Figure 1 - DF Election Extended Community

   Where the following fields are defined as follows:

   o DF Alg can have the following values:

     - Alg 0 - Default, modulo based DF election as per [RFC7432].
     - Alg 1 - HRW algorithm as per [DF]
     - Alg 2 - Preference algorithm (this document)


   o Bitmap can have the following values:

                          1 1 1 1 1 1

       determines if the PE advertising the ES route requests the remote
       PEs in the ES not to preempt it as DF. The default value is DP=0,
       which is compatible with the 'preempt' or 'revertive' behavior in
       the Default Alg [RFC7432]. The DP bit SHOULD be ignored if the DF
       Alg is different than 2.

     - Bit 1 - AC-DF or AC-Influenced DF Election, explained in [DF].
       The AC-DF capability bit MAY be set along with the DP capability
       and Alg 2.


   o DF Preference defines a 2-octet value that indicates the PE
     preference to become the DF in the ES. The allowed values are
     within the range 0-65535, and default value MUST be 32767. This
     value is the midpoint in the allowed Preference range of values,
     which gives the operator the flexibility of choosing a significant
     number of values, above or below the default Preference. The DF
     Preference field is specific to DF Alg 2 and does not represent any
     Preference value for other Algs.

   Figure 1 shows three PEs that are connecting EVCs coming from the
   Aggregation Network to their EVIs in the EVPN network. CE1 is
   connected to vES1 - that spans PE1 and PE2 - and CE2 is connected to
   vES2, that is defined in PE1, PE2 and PE3. 

   If the algorithm chosen for vES1 and vES2 is Alg 2, i.e. Preference-
   based, the PEs may become DF irrespective of their IP address and
   based on an administrative Preference value. The following sections
   provide some examples of the new defined procedures and how they are
   applied in the use-case in Figure 1.


4.1 Use of the Preference algorithm

   Assuming the operator wants to control - in a flexible way - what PE
   becomes the DF for a given vES and the order in which the PEs become
   DF in case of multiple failures, the following procedure may be used:

   a) vES1 and vES2 are now configurable with three optional parameters
      that are signaled in the DF Election extended community. These
      parameters are the Preference, Preemption option (or "Don't
      Preempt Me" option) and DF Alg. We will represent these parameters
      as [Pref,DP,Alg]. Let's assume vES1 is configured as [500,0,Pref]
      in PE1, and [255,0,Pref] in PE2. vES2 is configured as
      [100,0,Pref], [200,0,Pref] and [300,0,Pref] in PE1, PE2 and PE3
      respectively.

   b) The PEs will advertise an ES route for each vES, including the 3
      parameters in the DF Election Extended Community.

   c) According to [RFC7432], each PE will wait for the DF timer to
      expire before running the DF election algorithm. After the timer
      expires, each PE runs the Preference-based DF election algorithm
      as follows:

      o The PE will check the DF Alg in each ES route, and assuming all
        the ES routes are consistent in this DF Alg and the value is 2
        (Preference-based), the PE will run the new extended procedure.
        Otherwise, the procedure will fall back to [RFC7432] Default
        Alg.

      o In this extended procedure, each PE builds a list of candidate
        PEs, ordered based on the Preference. E.g. PE1 will build a list
        of candidate PEs for vES1 ordered by the Preference, from high
        to low: PE1>PE2. Hence PE1 will become the DF for vES1. In the
        same way, PE3 becomes the DF for vES2.

   d) Note that, by default, the Highest-Preference is chosen for each
 


Rabadan et al.           Expires April 25, 2019                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     Preference-based EVPN DF Election    October 22, 2018


      ES or vES, however the ES configuration can be changed to the
      Lowest-Preference algorithm as long as this option is consistent
      in all the PEs in the ES. E.g. vES1 could have been explicitly
      configured as Alg Preference-based with Lowest-Preference, in
      which case, PE2 would have been the DF.

   e) Assuming some maintenance tasks had to be executed on PE3, the
      operator could set vES2's preference to e.g. 50 so that PE2 is
      forced to take over as DF for vES2. Once the maintenance on PE3 is
      over, the operator could decide to leave the existing preference
      or configure the old preference back.

   f) In case of equal Preference in two or more PEs in the ES, the tie-
      breakers will be the DP bit and the lowest IP PE in that order.
      For instance:

      o If vES1 parameters were [500,0,Pref] in PE1 and [500,1,Pref] in
        PE2, PE2 would be elected due to the DP bit.

      o If vES1 parameters were [500,0,Pref] in PE1 and [500,0,Pref] in
        PE2, PE1 would be elected, assuming PE1's IP address is lower
        than PE2's.

   g) The Preference is an administrative option that MUST be configured
      on a per-ES basis from the management plane, but MAY also be
      dynamically changed based on the use of local policies. For
      instance, on PE1, ES1's Preference can be lowered from 500 to 100
      in case the bandwidth on the ENNI port is decreased a 50% (that
      could happen if e.g. the 2-port LAG between PE1 and the
      Aggregation Network loses one port). Policies MAY also trigger
      dynamic Preference changes based on the PE's bandwidth
      availability in the core, of specific ports going operationally
      down, etc. The definition of the actual local policies is out of
      scope of this document. The default Preference value is 32767. 


4.2 Use of the Preference algorithm in [RFC7432] Ethernet-Segments

   While the Preference-based DF Alg described in section 4.1 is
   typically used in virtual ES scenarios where there is normally an
   individual EVI per vES, the existing [RFC7432] definition of ES
   allows potentially up to thousands of EVIs on the same ES. If this is
   the case, and the operator still wants to control who the DF is for a
   given EVI, the use of the Preference-based DF Alg can also provide
   the desired level of load balancing.

   In this type of scenarios, the ES is configured with an
   administrative Preference value, but then a range of EVI/ISIDs can be
 


Rabadan et al.           Expires April 25, 2019                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     Preference-based EVPN DF Election    October 22, 2018


   defined to use the Highest-Preference or the Lowest-Preference
   depending on the desired behavior. With this option, the PE will
   build a list of candidate PEs ordered by the Preference, however the
   DF for a given EVI/ISID will be determined by the local
   configuration.

   For instance:

   o Assuming ES3 is defined in PE1 and PE2, PE1 may be configured as
     [500,0,Preference] for ES3 and PE2 as [100,0,Preference]. 

   o In addition, assuming vlan-based service interfaces, the PEs will
     be configured with (vlan/ISID-range,high_or_low), e.g. (1-
     2000,high) and (2001-4000, low). 

   o This will result in PE1 being DF for EVI/ISIDs 1-2000 and PE2 being
     DF for EVI/ISIDs 2001-4000.

   For Ethernet Segments attached to three or more PEs, any other logic
   that provides a fair distribution of the DF function among the PEs is
   valid, as long as that logic is consistent in all the PEs in the ES.


4.3 The Non-Revertive option

   As discussed in section 2(d), an option to NOT preempt the existing
   DF for a given EVI/ISID is required and therefore added to the DF
   Election extended community. This option will allow a non-revertive
   behavior in the DF election. 

   Note that, when a given PE in an ES is taken down for maintenance
   operations, before bringing it back, the Preference may be changed in
   order to provide a non-revertive behavior. The DP bit and the
   mechanism explained in this section will be used for those cases when
   a former DF comes back up without any controlled maintenance
   operation, and the non-revertive option is desired in order to avoid
   service impact.

   In Figure 1, we assume that based on the Highest-Pref, PE3 is the DF
   for ESI2.

   If PE3 has a link, EVC or node failure, PE2 would take over as DF.
   If/when PE3 comes back up again, PE3 will take over, causing some
   unnecessary packet loss in the ES. 

   The following procedure avoids preemption upon failure recovery
   (please refer to Figure 1):

Internet-Draft     Preference-based EVPN DF Election    October 22, 2018


   1) A new "Don't Preempt Me" parameter is defined on a per-PE per-ES
      basis, as described in section 3. If "Don't Preempt Me" is
      disabled (default behavior) the advertised DP bit will be 0. If
      "Don't Preempt Me" is enabled, the ES route will be advertised
      with DP=1 ("Don't Preempt Me").

   2) Assuming we want to avoid 'preemption', the three PEs are
      configured with the "Don't Preempt Me" option. Note that each PE
      individually MAY be configured with different preemption value. In
      this example, we assume ESI2 is configured as 'DP=enabled' in the
      three PEs.

   3) Assuming EVI1 uses Highest-Pref in vES2 and EVI2 uses Lowest-Pref,
      when vES2 is enabled in the three PEs, the PEs will exchange the
      ES routes and select PE3 as DF for EVI1 (due to the Highest-Pref
      type), and PE1 as DF for EVI2 (due to the Lowest-Pref). 

   4) If PE3's vES2 goes down (due to EVC failure - detected by OAM, or
      port failure or node failure), PE2 will become the DF for EVI1. No
      changes will occur for EVI2.

   5) When PE3's vES2 comes back up, PE3 will start a boot-timer (if
      booting up) or hold-timer (if the port or EVC recovers). That
      timer will allow some time for PE3 to receive the ES routes from
      PE1 and PE2. PE3 will then:

      o Select two "reference-PEs" among the ES routes in the vES, the
        "Highest-PE" and the "Lowest-PE":

        - The Highest-PE is the PE with higher Preference, using the DP
          bit first (with DP=1 being better) and, after that, the lower
          PE-IP address as tie-breakers. PE3 will select PE2 as Highest-
          PE over PE1, since, when comparing [Pref,DP,PE-IP],
          [200,1,PE2-IP] wins over [100,1,PE1-IP].       

        - The Lowest-PE is the PE with lower Preference, using the DP
          bit first (with DP=1 being better) and, after that, the lower
          PE-IP address as tie-breakers. PE3 will select PE1 as Lowest-
          PE over PE2, since [100,1,PE1-IP] wins over [200,1,PE2-IP].   
             

        - Note that if there were only one remote PE in the ES, Lowest
          and Highest PE would be the same PE.

      o Check its own administrative Pref and compares it with the one
        of the Highest-PE and Lowest-PE that have DP=1 in their ES
        routes. Depending on this comparison PE3 will send the ES route
        with a [Pref,DP] that may be different from its administrative

        [Pref,DP]:

        - If PE3's Pref value is higher than the Highest-PE's, PE3 will
          send the ES route with an 'in-use' operational Pref equal to
          the Highest-PE's and DP=0.

        - If PE3's Pref value is lower than the Lowest-PE's, PE3 will
          send the ES route with an 'in-use' operational Preference
          equal to the Lowest-PE's and DP=0.

        - If PE3's Pref value is neither higher nor lower than the
          Highest-PE's or the Lowest-PE's respectively, PE3 will send
          the ES route with its administrative [Pref,DP]=[300,1].

        - In this example, PE3's administrative Pref=300 is higher than
          the Highest-PE with DP=1, that is, PE2 (Pref=200). Hence PE3
          will inherit PE2's preference and send the ES route with an
          operational 'in-use' [Pref,DP]=[200,0].

      Note that, a PE will always send DP=0 as long as the advertised
      Pref is the 'in-use' operational Pref (as opposed to the
      'administrative' Pref). 

      This ES route update sent by PE3 (with [200,0,PE3-IP]) will not
      cause any DF switchover for any EVI/ISID. PE2 will continue being
      DF for EVI1. This is because the DP bit will be used as a tie-
      breaker in the DF election. That is, if a PE has two candidate PEs
      with the same Pref, it will pick up the one with DP=1. There are
      no DF changes for EVI2 either. 

   6) Subsequently, if PE2 fails, upon receiving PE2's ES route
      withdrawal, PE3 and PE1 will go through the process described in
      (5) to select new Highest and Lowest-PEs (considering their own
      active ES route) and then they will run the DF Election. 

      o If a PE selects itself as new Highest or Lowest-PE and it was
        not before, the PE will then compare its operational 'in-use'
        Pref with its administrative Pref. If different, the PE will
        send an ES route update with its administrative Pref and DP
        values. In the example, PE3 will be the new Highest-PE,
        therefore it will send an ES route update with
        [Pref,DP]=[300,1].    

      o After running the DF Election, PE3 will become the new DF for
        EVI1. No changes will occur for EVI2.  

   Note that, irrespective of the DP bit, when a PE or ES comes back and
   the PE advertises a DF Election Alg different than 2 (Preference
