Abstract

   This document describes an ESP encapsulation for IPsec, allowing
   intermediate devices to ascertain if ESP-NULL is being employed and
   hence inspect the IPsec packets for network monitoring and access
   control functions.  Currently in the IPsec standard, there is no way
   to differentiate between ESP encryption and ESP NULL encryption by
   simply examining a packet.


1.  Introduction

   Use of ESP within IPsec [RFC4303] specifies how ESP packet

   encapsulation is performed.  It also specifies that ESP can use NULL
   encryption [RFC2410] while preserving data integrity and
   authenticity.  The exact encapsulation and algorithms employed are
   negotiated out-of-band using, for example, IKE [RFC2409] or IKEv2
   [RFC4306] and based on policy.

   Enterprise environments typically employ numerous security policies
   (and tools for enforcing them), as related to access control,
   firewalls, network monitoring functions, deep packet inspection,
   Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS and IPS), scanning
   and detection of viruses and worms, etc.  In order to enforce these
   policies, network tools and intermediate devices require visibility
   into packets, ranging from simple packet header inspection to deeper
   payload examination.  Network security protocols which encrypt the
   data in transit prevent these network tools from performing the
   aforementioned functions.

   When employing IPsec within an enterprise environment, it is
   desirable to employ ESP instead of AH [RFC4302], as AH does not work
   in NAT environments.  Furthermore, in order to preserve the above
   network monitoring functions, it is desirable to use ESP-NULL.  In a
   mixed mode environment some packets containing sensitive data employ
   a given encryption cipher suite, while other packets employ ESP-NULL.
   For an intermediate device to unambiguously distinguish which packets
   are leveraging ESP-NULL, they would require knowledge of all the
   policies being employed for each protected session.  This is clearly
   not practical.  Heuristic-based methods can be employed to parse the
   packets, but these can be very expensive, containing numerous rules
   based on each different protocol and payload.  Even then, the parsing
   may not be robust in cases where fields within a given encrypted
   packet happen to resemble the fields for a given protocol or
   heuristic rule.  This is even more problematic when different length
   Initialization Vectors (IVs), Integrity Check Values (ICVs) and
   padding are used for different security associations, making it
   difficult to determine the start and end of the payload data, let
   alone attempting any further parsing.  Furthermore, storage, lookup
   and cross-checking a set of comprehensive rules against every packet
   adds cost to hardware implementations and degrades performance.  In
   cases where the packets may be encrypted, it is also wasteful to
   check against heuristics-based rules, when a simple exception policy
   (e.g., allow, drop or redirect) can be employed to handle the
   encrypted packets.  Because of the non-deterministic nature of
   heuristics-based rules for disambiguating between encrypted and non-
   encrypted data, an alternative method for enabling intermediate
   devices to function in encrypted data environments needs to be
   defined.  Enterprise environments typically use both stateful and
   stateless packet inspection mechanisms.  The previous considerations
   weigh particularly heavy on stateless mechanisms such as router ACLs

   and NetFlow exporters.

   This document defines a mechanism to prove additional information in
   relevant IPsec packets so intermediate devices can efficiently
   differentiate between encrypted ESP packets and ESP packets with NULL
   encryption.

   The document is consistent with the operation of ESP in NAT
   environments [RFC3947].

   The design principles for this protocol are the following:

   o  Allow easy identification and parsing of integrity-only IPsec
      traffic

   o  Leverage the existing hardware IPsec parsing engines as much as
      possible to minimize additional hardware design costs

   o  Minimize the packet overhead in the common case

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Applicability Statement

   The document is applicable only to the Extended ESP header defined
   below, and does not describe any changes to either ESP [RFC4303] nor
   AH [RFC4302].


2.  Extended ESP (XESP) Header format

   The proposal is to define an Extended ESP protocol number, which
   provides additional attributes in each packet.  The value of the new
   protocol is TBD and the format of the new encapsulation is defined
   below.

   Next Header:  next protocol header (encrypted in ESP trailer, but in
      the clear in header), providing easy access to a HW parser to
      extract the upper layer protocol.  Note: For security concerns,
      this value may optionally be set to zero, in which case the next
      header can be extracted from the ESP trailer.


   HdrLen:  includes the new header + full ESP header + the IV (if
      present).  It is an offset to the beginning of the Payload Data.

   TrailerLen:  Offset from the end of the packet including the ICV, pad
      length, and any padding.  It is an offset from the end of the
      packet to the last byte of the payload data.


   Flags

      2 bits:  Version

      1 bit:  IntegrityOnly: Payload Data is not encrypted (ESP-NULL).

      5 bits:  reserved for future use.  These MUST be set to zero per
         this specification, but usage may be defined by other
         specifications.


   As can be seen, this Extended ESP format simply extended the standard
   ESP header by the first 4 octets.

2.1.  UDP Encapsulation

   This section describes a mechanism for running the new packet format
   over the existing UDP encapsulation of ESP as defined in RFC 3948.
   This allows leveraging the existing IKE negotiation of the UDP port
   for NAT-T discovery and usage [RFC3947], as well as preserving the
   existing UDP ports for ESP (port 4500).  With UDP encapsulation, the
   packet format can be depicted as follows.

   Protocol Identifier:  new field to demultiplex between UDP
      encapsulation of IKE, UDP encapsulation of ESP per RFC 3948, and
      this proposal.


   According to RFC 3948, clause 2.2, a 4 octet value of zero (0)
   immediately following the UDP header indicates a Non-ESP marker,
   which can be used to assume that the data following that value is an
   IKE packet.  Similarly, a value of non-zero indicates that the packet
   is an ESP packet and the 4-octet value can be treated as the ESP SPI.
   However, RFC 4303, clause 2.1 indicates that the values 1-255 are
   reserved and cannot be used as the SPI.  We leverage that knowledge
   and use a value of 1 to indicate that the UDP encapsulated ESP header
   contains this new packet format for ESP encapsulation.

   The remaining fields in the packet have the same meaning as per
   section 2.0 above.

2.2.  Tunnel and Transport mode of considerations

   This extension is equally applicable for tunnel and transport mode
   where the ESP Next Header field is used to differentiate between
   these modes, as per the existing IPsec specifications.

2.3.  IKE Considerations

   In order to negotiate the new format of ESP encapsulation via IKE,
   both sides of the security channel need to agree upon using the new
   packet format.  This can be achieved by proposing a new protocol ID
   within the existing IKE proposal structure as defined by RFC 4306,
   clause 3.3.1.  The existing proposal substructure in this clause
   allows negotiation of ESP/AH (among others) by using different
   protocol Ids for these protocols.  By using the same protocol
   substructure in the proposal payload and using a new value (TBD) for
   this encapsulation, the existing IKE negotiation can be leverage with
   minimal changes to support negotiation of this encapsulation.

   Furthermore, because the negotiation is at the protocol level, other
   transforms remain valid for this new encapsulation and consistent
   with IKEv2 [RFC4306].  Additionally, NAT-T [RFC3948] is wholly
   compatible with this extended frame format and can be used as-is,
   without any modifications, in environments where NAT is present and
   needs to be taken into account.

4.  IANA Considerations

   Reserving an appropriate value for this encapsulation as well as a
   new value for the protocol in the IKE negotiation is TBD by IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   As this document augments the existing ESP encapsulation format, UDP
   encapsulation definitions specified in RFC 3948 and IKE negotiation
   of the new encapsulation, the security observations made in those
   documents also apply here.  In addition, as this document allows
   intermediate device visibility into IPsec ESP encapsulated frames for
   the purposes of network monitoring functions, care should be taken
   not to send sensitive data over connections using definitions from
   this document, based on network domain/administrative policy.  A
   strong key agreement protocol, such as IKE, together with a strong
   policy engine should be used to in determining appropriate security
   policy for the given traffic streams and data over which it is being
   employed.
