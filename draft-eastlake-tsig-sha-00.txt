   specified.  This document specifies identifiers for additional HMAC
   SHA TSIG algorithms.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                 HMAC-SHA TSIG Identifiers


1. Introduction

   [RFC 2845] specifies a TSIG Resource Record that can be used to
   authenticate DNS queries and responses. This RR contains a domain
   name syntax data item which names the authentication algorithm used.
   [RFC 2845] defines the HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT name for
   authentication codes using the HMAC [RFC 2104] algorithm with the MD5
   [RFC 1321] hash algorithm. IANA has also registered "gss-tsig" as an
   identifier for TSIG authentication where the cryptographic operations
   are delegated to GSS [RFC gsstsig]. This document specifies
   additional names for TSIG authentication algorithms based on US NIST
   SHA algorithms, HMAC, and truncation.

2. Algorithms and Identifiers

   TSIG Resource Records (RRs) [RFC 2845] are used to authenticate DNS
   queries and responses.  They are intended to be efficient symmetric
   authentication codes based on a shared secret. (Asymmetric signatures
   can be provided using the SIG RR [RFC 2931].) Used with a strong hash
   function, HMAC [RFC 2104] provides a way to calculate such symmetric
   authentication codes. The only specified HMAC based TSIG algorithm
   identifier has been HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT based on MD5 [RFC 1321].
   However, MD5 is beginning to show its age and some signs of weakness
   have been found. While these particular weaknesses should have no
   effect on MD5 use with HMAC, identifiers are defined herein for using
   more recent hash functions which are believed to be stronger.

   In particular, SHA-1 [FIPS 180-1, RFC 3174], which is a 160 bit hash
   as compared with the 128 bits for MD5, and upcoming additional hash
   algorithms in the SHA family [FIPS 180-2] with 256, 384, and 512
   bits, may be preferred in some case. Use of TSIG between a DNS
   resolver and server is by mutual agreement which agreement can
   include the support of additonal algorithms.

   In some cases, it is reasonable to truncate the output of HMAC and
   use the truncated value for authentication. Since the syntax for TSIG
   algorithm identifiers is that of a domain name, this is indicated in
   these identifiers by a leading decimal lable which gives the
   truncated length in bits. When truncation occurs, the bits used are
   the initila bits, trailing bits being discarded.

   For completeness in relation to HMAC based algorithms, the current
   HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT identifier is included in the table below.

         Mandatory      HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT

         Recommended    sha1
         Recommended    80.sha1
         Optional       sha256
         Optional       128.sha256
         Optional       sha384
         Optional       192.sha384
         Optional       sha512
         Optional       256.sha512

3. IANA Considerations

   This document, on approval by IETF Consensus [RFC 2434], registers
   the new TSIG algorithm identifiers listed in Section 2 with IANA.



4. Security Considerations

   For all of the hash algorithms listed herein, those producing longer
   hash values are believed to be stronger.

   See Security Considerations section of [RFC 2845].
