Internet-Draft        Emergency Dialstring from DHC            Feb 2006


1.  Introduction

   [ID-SOS] describes a universal emergency call URN to be used to 
   identify a call as an emergency call.  This URN is not intended to 
   be dialed, but rather is to be used by the User Agent as an address.
   The intention is to translate (as with any other dial plan) the 
   existing emergency dialstring to the universal URN.

   In many countries, short codes are used as emergency dialstrings to 
   identify emergency calls.  In others, a complete local telephone 
   number is needed.  These dialstrings are locally specific, typically
   by country, and may vary in length.  In some countries, a single 
   dialstring is used ('999' is the dialstring for all emergency calls 
   in the United Kingdom).  In other countries, there are different 
   dialstrings for different emergency services;  '116' is the 
   dialstring for police in Switzerland, '117' is the dialstring for 
   fire.

   Users are taught, often from a very early age, what the local 
   dialstrings for emergency calls are, and it is not practical to 
   attempt to change the dialstring to a more uniform choice.  When 
   using systems that permit roaming, local laws often require that 
   telephony systems recognize the local ("visited") emergency 
   dialstrings.  

   What is needed is a mechanism for a User Agent (or other device that
   can place emergency calls) to learn the local emergency 
   dialstring(s) so that it can recognize an emergency call when that 
   numeric sequence is dialed by the user.  This visited emergency 
   dialstring(s) may be displayed to the user in its screen when 
   learned, if the phone has that capability.

   This document defines a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
   Option [RFC2131] for a client to be able to request its locally 
   significant emergency dialstring(s) from the local infrastructure.

2.  DHC Emergency Dialstring Option Format

   The format for this Option is as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |   Code XXX    |    Length     |         Country Code          +
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |   Service ID  |           Dialstring Digits                   +
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                  Dialstring Digits (cont'd)   |               |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

            Figure 1. The Emergency Dialstring Option Format

   Code =         The IANA Assigned Option number

   Length =       This is a variable length value of the number of 
                  bytes in the Option, including this length field.

   Country Code = The two octet ISO country code.

   Service Identifier = the one octet indication of type of dialstring

   Dialstring =   This is emergency dialstring digits, one per byte, to
                  a maximum of 16 digits.  This is variable in length 
                  based on the number of digits in the dialstring.


2.1  Rules of Usage of This Option

   The following are the rules of usage of this DHCP Option:

   - this option can be part of a message with other options, or it can 
     be the only option in the message.

   - the maximum number of base10 digits is 16, to correspond with the 
     maximum known size of a dialstring in the circuit world.

   - the minimum option length is 5, 

   - the minimum option length with a single digit emergency dialstring 
     present is 6

   - the country code and Service ID fields can be empty (null) in any 
     message, but are not deleted for any reason in this Option

   - if the length field is 6, and the dialstring field value is 
     0x00000000, this means the base10 digit is '0', and should not be 
     considered an empty field

Internet-Draft        Emergency Dialstring from DHC            Feb 2006

   - if there is an emergency dialstring in the option, even if the 
     value is '0', a Service ID field left empty is equivalent to a 
     value of 0x00000000 or the general emergency service type of 
     urn:service:sos (i.e. not police only, or fire only).

   - The maximum hex value for any one byte of dialstring value is 
     0x00001001

   - A client requesting this option be returned from a server would be
     accomplished by sending this option in a DISCOVER, REQUEST or 
     INFORM message with a length field of 5, emulating a NULL 
     dialstring field value.

   - If a request with a null country code is made to a DHCP server 
     which implements the [RFC3825] or [ID-CIVIC] options, and the 
     server can determine the location it returns or would have 
     returned for those options, then it MUST return the dialstrings 
     for the country for that location.

   - If a request with a null country code is made to a DHCP server 
     which does not support [RFC3825] or [ID-CIVIC] or the server 
     cannot determine the location it returns or would have returned, 
     but it CAN unambiguously determine which country the requestor is 
     located in (perhaps because it only serves one country, or it can 
     determine based on the request and its knowledge of the network 
     topography and geography that it could only be in one country), 
     then it MUST return the dialstrings for that country.

   - If a request with a null country code is made to a DHCP server 
     where neither of the above two conditions are met, the DHCP server
     MUST return dialstrings for all countries the geography of the 
     local network covers.

   - It is RECOMMENDED this request be in a REQUEST or INFORM message, 
     in which case the message is unicast to the server

   - it is currently not envisioned why a non-empty option would be 
     sent from a client to server.


3.  Open Questions

   The following open questions are left to be answered based on 
   feedback during the review of this document:

   - Using octets for dialable numbers with a maximum range of 16 is a 
     waste of space.  It would be possible to use a more compact form 
     of representation, from a long integer to three hex digits per 
     octet.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned a DHCP option code of [XXX] for the Emergency 
   Dialstring option defined in this document.


5.  Security Considerations

   Where critical decisions might be based on the value of this 
   emergency dialstring option, DHCP authentication in [RFC3118] SHOULD
   be used to protect the integrity of the DHCP options.

   Since there is no privacy protection for DHCP messages, an 
   eavesdropper who can monitor the link between the client and 
   destination DHCP server to capture any emergency dialstrings in 
   transit.  While learning a publicly known emergency dialstring is 
   not a security risk, having that information altered in transit is a
   security risk.  

   When implementing a DHC server that will serve clients across an 
   uncontrolled network, one should consider the potential security 
   risks.
