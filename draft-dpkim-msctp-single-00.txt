Internet-Draft   Use of ASCONF Chunk for A Single-Homed Host   May 2007 
    

1. Introduction 

   SCTP can be used to support IP handover between different subnets 
   with the help of ADDIP extension. It maintains the association during 
   the handover process, by adding the newly obtained address and 
   changing the primary address and deleting the old address in the 
   overlapping region between heterogeneous wireless networks. More 
   specially, SCTP handover can be reasonably defined for heterogeneous 
   wireless networks where the hosts are multi-homed. It may provide 
   better performance than the existing schemes in term of handover 
   delay because the multi-homed host can perform the handover into the 
   new address while the DATA chunks are transmitted through the 
   existing address.  

   However, SCTP handover for homogeneous wireless networks where the 
   host is single-homed may cause the serious communication delay while 
   the address is being renumbered. Differently with the multi-homed 
   host, the single-homed host uses only one IP address. It may cause 
   several reasons for the communication delay. In addition, the host 
   can set the primary address by using the ASCONF chunk containing Set 
   Primary ASCONF Parameter for SCTP handover. However, the single-homed 
   host cannot send the Set Primary ASCONF Parameter according to the 
   limitation of current SCTP ADD-IP extension.  

   In this document, we describe the some issues that can be occurred in 
   SCTP handover for homogeneous wireless networks where the host is 
   single-homed. Then, we propose the use of the ASCONF with the 
   cumulative ASCONF Parameters used for IP handover. 

2. Motivation 

   The issues in SCTP handover for homogeneous wireless networks that 
   cause communication delay can be described as the follows: 

   1)           A single-homed host may send the ASCONF chunk including Add IP 
      ASCONF Parameter using new address in IP header to the peer 
      according to the movement into the new subnet region. Then, the 
      peer may reply to the source address of the packet in this case 
      which is the new address that was added by the ASCONF.  

      However, the peer can not send SCTP data using the new destination 
      address to the endpoint until such time as it is confirmed to the 
      address verification procedure for the added address. In this 
      phase, the peer tries to subsequently send SCTP data to the old 
      address of the MN. It may cause that RTO value is considerably 
      increased by the fact that many retransmission failures are 
      occurred. After current RTO expiration, the peer may be able to

      send SCTP data to the new address of the singled-homed host. It 
      may cause the serious communication delay during this period.  

   2)           To support smoother and faster IP handover, the host may set the 
      primary address by sending the ASCONF Chunk containing Set Primary 
      ASCONF parameter after adding the IP address. The receiver can 
      change the primary destination to the specified address. 

      However, the single-homed host may not send the ASCONF Chunk 
      containing Set Primary Parameter using the new address as a source 
      address according to the current ADD-IP extension. So, we need to 
      clarify the Set Primary ASCONF Parameter for the single-homed host.  

   3)           After the Set Primary, the endpoints may use the new address as a 
      source and destination address. However, the retransmission or 
      other chunks except ASCONF Chunks can be transmitted to the old 
      address, since the old address is still available from the 
      association. Thus, it is required that ASCONF Chunk containing 
      Delete IP ASCONF Parameter should be sent from the single-homed 
      host.  

   Based on the problems given above, we suggest that the single-homed 
   host can send the ASCONF Chunk cumulatively containing the Add IP and 
   Set Primary and Delete IP to support the smoother and faster IP 
   handover between homogeneous wireless networks. It is noted that the 
   endpoints can transmit all chunks using the new address after the 
   process of ASCONF and ASCONF-ACK Chunks with the cumulative ASCONF 
   Parameters. 

3. Use of ASCONF Chunk for SCTP Handover 

3.1. ASCONF Chunk with cumulative ASCONF Parameters  

   To support the faster and smoother IP handover for homogeneous 
   wireless networks, we propose that the single-homed host can send the 
   ASCONF chunk containing the Add IP and Set Primary and Delete IP 
   address ASCONF Parameters and receive the ASCONF-ACK chunk with a 
   cumulative ASCONF Parameter Responses as a response.  

   Figure 1 shows the structure of ASCONF chunk with cumulative ASCONF 
   Parameters.

          Figure 1 ASCONF chunk Format with Cumulated Parameters. 

   As seen in Figure 1, the structure of the ASCONF chunk is the same 
    with  the  one  specified  in  SCTP  ADDIP  extension.  Merely,  the 
    difference is that the ASCONF chunk can contains the Add IP and Set 
    Primary and Delete IP ASCONF parameters. It may be sent by the 
    single-homed host when it goes into a new subnet region and obtains 
    the new address. In addition, the host may send this ASCONF chunk 
    using the new address in the IP header. It is noted that all chunks 
    are enclosed with the authenticated chunks to ensure the secure 
    signaling process for the SCTP handover.

          Figure 2 ASCONF Parameters contained in the ASCONF chunk 

   As seen in Figure 2, the ASCONF Parameters has the same packet format 
   with those defined in the SCTP ADDIP extension. Only, the Address 
   Parameter in each ASCONF Parameter may be differently designated 
   according the Parameter types.  

   The Address Parameters of the Add IP and Set Primary ASCONF 
   Parameters must be specified by the new address of the single-homed 
   host that newly obtained in the new subnet region. On the other hand, 
   the Delete IP ASCONF Parameter should fill into the Address Parameter 
   with the old address of the single-homed host. 

3.3. Operations of the ASCONF chunk with the cumulative ASCONF 
   Parameters 

   When the single-homed host obtains the new IP address as it goes into 
   a new subnet, it can send the ASCONF with the Add IP and Set Primary 
   and Delete IP ASCONF parameters using the new address in the IP 
   header. Then, the receiver may reply with the ASCONF Parameter 
   Responses reporting the status of ASCONF processing in the ASCONF-ACK.

   If a responding endpoint indicates the success, both two peers may 
   transmit SCTP data each other, using the new address as a source 
   address and destination address. 

4. SCTP Handover Procedure for Single-homed Host 

   We consider a single-homed mobile client (MC) that initiates an SCTP 
   association with a fixed server (FS) and then moves from Location A 
   and Location B.  

   The overall SCTP handover procedures for homogeneous wireless 
   networks are performed as follows:  

    

   1) When the MC leaves from Location A and goes into Location B, the 
       MC may not transmit SCTP data using the old address in new subnet 
       region. It means that the MC and FS can communication each other 
       during this period. It is called hard handover by L2 level.  

   2) After the MC obtains or configures from DHCP server or through 
       IPv6 address auto-configuration, it can send the ASCONF chunk to 
       reconfigure the ongoing address for IP handover. More especially, 
       it is noted that ASCONF chunk cumulatively encloses the Add IP 
       and Set Primary and Delete IP ASCONF parameters. In the Add IP 
       and Set Primary ASCONF Parameter, the new address is filled into 
       the Address Parameters of them.  

   3) When the FS receives the ASCONF with the cumulative ASCONF 
       Parameters, it processes and then reply with ASCONF-ACK 
       containing the correspondent ASCONF Parameter Reponses to the 
       newly address destination address.  

   4) If ASCONF Parameter Reponses does not include any Error Cause, 
       the MC and FS sends the SCTP data using the new address as a 
       source and destination address. More especially, the 
       retransmission failed during lower layer disconnection is also 
       transmitted by the new address.  

   5) After then, the SCTP association between two endpoints does not 
       use the old address any more. 

   The procedural steps described above will be repeated any time the MC 
   moves toward the new subnet region.

5. Further Issues  

   This section describes the further issues required to support faster 
   and smoother IP handover between homogeneous wireless networks. 

5.1. Address Verification 

   After handover process, the peer host is required to verify the new 
   destination address before it sends DATA chunks using the new address. 
   In other words, the peer host should confirm the reachability of the 
   newly added address by using the address verification procedures. For 
   this purpose, it is necessary that the address verification should be 
   defined. 

5.2. Implementation Support  

   To evaluate the proposed scheme, some implementation should be 
   supported. Until now, there is no implementation supporting the IP 
   handover for the single-homed host. More specially, the ASCONF chunk 
   that fills into Address Parameter with the old address should be sent 
   from the new address in the IP header.
