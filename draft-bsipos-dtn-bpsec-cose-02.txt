1.  Introduction

   The Bundle Protocol Security (BPSec) Specification
   [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec] defines structure and encoding for Block
   Integrity Block (BIB) and Block Confidentiality Block (BCB) types but
   does not specify any security contexts to be used by either of the
   security block types.  The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)
   specification [RFC8152] defines a structure, encoding, and algorithms
   to use for cryptographic signing and encryption.

   This document describes how to use the algorithms and encodings of
   COSE within BPSec blocks to apply those algorithms to Bundle security
   in Section 3.  A bare minimum of interoperability algorithms and
   algorithm parameters is specified by this document in Section 4.

   This document does not address how those COSE algorithms are intended
   to be used within a larger security context.  Examples of specific
   uses are provided in Appendix A to aid in implementation support of
   the interoperability algorithms.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  BPSec Security Context

   This document specifies a single security context for use in both
   BPSec integrity and confidentiality blocks.  This is done to save
   code points allocated to this specification and to simplify the
   encoding of COSE-in-BPSec; the BPSec block type uniquely defines the
   acceptable COSE messages which can be present and each COSE message
   is type-tagged to indicate its purpose and contents.

   The COSE security context shall have the Security Context ID
   specified in Section 7.1.

   The existing CoAP Content-Format ID values in the CoRE registry
   [IANA-CORE] SHALL be used as BPSec Parameter ID and Result ID values
   within COSE security context (see tables within Section 3.1 and
   Section 3.2).  For Result ID values used to identify COSE messages,
   these code points are also identical to the existing COSE message-
   marking tags in Section 2 of [RFC8152].  This avoids the need for
   value-mapping between code points of the two registries.

   When embedding COSE messages, the CBOR-tagged form SHALL NOT be used.
   The Result ID values already provide the same information as the COSE
   tags (using the same code points).

3.1.  COSE Integrity

   When used within a Block Integrity Block, COSE context SHALL allow
   only the Parameter IDs from Table 1.  Each integrity parameter value
   SHALL consist of the COSE structure indicated by Table 1 in its
   decoded form.

            +==============+=====================+===========+
            | Parameter ID | Parameter Structure | Reference |
            +==============+=====================+===========+

   When used within a Block Integrity Block, COSE context SHALL allow
   only the Result IDs from Table 2.  Each integrity result value SHALL
   consist of the COSE message indicated by Table 2 in its decoded form.

               +===========+==================+===========+
               | Result ID | Result Structure | Reference |
               +===========+==================+===========+
               | 97        | COSE_Mac         | [RFC8152] |
               +-----------+------------------+-----------+
               | 17        | COSE_Mac0        | [RFC8152] |
               +-----------+------------------+-----------+
               | 98        | COSE_Sign        | [RFC8152] |
               +-----------+------------------+-----------+
               | 18        | COSE_Sign1       | [RFC8152] |
               +-----------+------------------+-----------+

                     Table 2: COSE Integrity Results

   Each integrity result SHALL use the "detached" payload form with nil
   payload value.  The integrity result for COSE_Mac and COSE_Mac0
   messages are computed by the procedure in Section 6.3 of [RFC8152].
   The integrity result for COSE_Sign and COSE_Sign1 messages are
   computed by the procedure in Section 4.4 of [RFC8152].

   [NOTE: This differs from base BPSec in that the entire block and the
   bundle primary is signed] The COSE "payload" used to generate a
   signature or MAC result SHALL be the canonically serialized target
   block, including the canonical block array structure.  The COSE
   "protected attributes from the application" used to generate a
   signature or MAC result SHALL be either:

   For a primary block target:  An empty byte string.

   For a canonical block target:  The canonically serialized primary
      block of the bundle.

3.2.  COSE Confidentiality

   When used within a Block Confidentiality Block, COSE context SHALL
   allow only the Parameter IDs from Table 3.  Each integrity parameter
   value SHALL consist of the COSE structure indicated by Table 3 in its
   decoded form.

                    Table 3: COSE Integrity Parameters

   When used within a Block Confidentiality Block, COSE context SHALL
   allow only the Result IDs from Table 4.  Each confidentiality result
   value SHALL consist of the COSE message indicated by Table 4 in its
   decoded form.

               +===========+==================+===========+

               +-----------+------------------+-----------+

                  Table 4: COSE Confidentiality Results

   Only algorithms which support Authenticated Encryption with
   Authenticated Data (AEAD) SHALL be usable in the first (content)
   layer of a confidentiality result.  Because COSE encryption with AEAD
   appends the authentication tag with the ciphertext, the size of the
   block-type-specific-data will grow after an encryption operation.

   Each confidentiality result SHALL use the "detached" payload form
   with nil payload value.  The COSE plaintext and ciphertext correspond
   exactly with the target block-type-specific-data.  The
   confidentiality result for COSE_Encrypt and COSE_Encrypt0 messages
   are computed by the procedure in Section 5.3 of [RFC8152].

   [NOTE: This differs from base BPSec in that AAD from the block and
   the bundle primary is used] The COSE "plaintext" used to generate an
   encrypt result SHALL be the block-type-specific-data of the target
   block, the decoded byte string itself (not including the encoded CBOR
   item header).  The COSE "protected attributes from the application"
   used to generate an encrypt result SHALL be the concatenation of the
   following:

   1.  The canonically serialized primary block of the bundle.

   2.  The canonically serialized augmented target block, which has its
       block-type-specific-data substituted with an empty byte string.

4.  COSE Profile for BPSec

   This section contains requirements which apply to the use of COSE
   within BPSec across any security context use.

4.1.  COSE Security Parameters

   When necessary to support public key infrastructure (PKI) within
   BPSec, a BIB or BCB with a COSE context MAY contain one or more
   public keys or key identifiers.  Because each context contains a
   single set of parameters which apply to all results in the same
   context, security acceptors SHALL treat all COSE keys as being
   related to the security source itself and potentially applying to
   every result.

4.2.  COSE Security Results

   When generating a BPSec result, security sources SHALL use encode
   COSE labels with a uint value.  When processing a BPSec result,
   security acceptors MAY handle COSE labels with with a tstr value.

   When used in a BPSec result, each COSE message SHALL contain an
   explicit algorithm identifier in the lower (content) layers.  When
   available and not implied by the bundle source, a COSE message SHOULD
   contain a key identifier in the highest (recipient) layer.  When a
   key identifier is not available, BPSec acceptors SHOULD use the
   Security Source (if available) and the Bundle Source to imply which
   keys can be used for security operations.  A BPSec security operation
   always occurs within the context of the immutable primary block with
   its parameters (specifically the Source Node ID) and the security
   block with its optional Security Source.

   The algorithms required by this profile focuses on networks using
   shared symmetric-keys, with recommended algorithms for Elliptic Curve
   (EC) keypairs and RSA keypairs.  The focus of this profile is to
   enable interoperation between security sources and acceptors on an
   open network, where more explicit COSE parameters make it easier for
   BPSec acceptors to avoid assumptions and avoid out-of-band
   parameters.  The requirements of this profile still allow the use of
   potentially not-easily-interoperable algorithms and message/recipient
   configurations for use by private networks, where message size is
   more important than explicit COSE parameters.

4.3.  Interoperability Algorithms

   [NOTE: The required list is identical to the
   [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec-interop-sc] list.]  The set of integrity
   algorithms needed for interoperability is listed here.  The full set
   of COSE algorithms available is managed at [IANA-COSE].

   Implementations conforming to this specification SHALL support the
   symmetric keyed algorithms of Table 5.  Implementations capable of
   doing so SHOULD support the asymmetric keyed and key-encryption
   algorithms of Table 5.

                    Table 5: Interoperability Algorithms

   The following are recommended key and recipient uses within COSE/
   BPSec:

   Symmetric Key Integrity:  When generating a BIB result from a
      symmetric key, implementations SHOULD use either a COSE_Mac0 or a
      COSE_Mac using the private key directly.  When a COSE_Mac is used
      with a direct key, the recipient layer SHOULD include a key
      identifier.

Internet-Draft               DTN BPSec COSE                 October 2020


   EC Keypair Integrity:  When generating a BIB result from an EC
      keypair, implementations SHOULD use either a COSE_Sign1 or a
      COSE_Sign using the private key directly or a COSE_Mac from a
      symmetric key with a layer-2 encryption of the symmetric key.
      When a COSE_Sign or COSE_Mac is used with EC keypair, the
      recipient layer SHOULD include a public key identifier.

   RSA Keypair Integrity:  When generating a BIB result from an RSA
      keypair, implementations SHOULD use either a COSE_Sign1 or a
      COSE_Sign using the private key directly or a COSE_Mac from a
      symmetric key with a layer-2 key-wrap of the symmetric key.  When
      a COSE_Sign or COSE_Mac is used with RSA keypair, the recipient
      layer SHOULD include a public key identifier.  When a COSE_Sign or
      COSE_Sign1 is used with RSA keypair, the signature uses a maximum-
      length PSS salt in accordance with [RFC8230].

   Symmetric Key Confidentiality:  When generating a BCB result from an
      symmetric key, implementations SHOULD use a COSE_Encrypt message
      with a recipient containing a key-wrapped CEK.  When generating a
      BCB result from a symmetric key, implementations SHOULD NOT use
      COSE_Encrypt0 or COSE_Encrypt with direct content encryption key
      (CEK).  Doing so risks key overuse and the vulnerabilities
      associated with large amount of ciphertext from the same key.

   EC Keypair Confidentiality:  When generating a BCB result from an EC
      keypair, implementations SHOULD use a COSE_Encrypt message with a
      recipient containing a key-wrapped CEK.

   RSA Keypair Confidentiality:  When generating a BCB result from an
      RSA keypair, implementations SHOULD use a COSE_Encrypt message
      with a recipient containing a key-wrapped CEK.

5.  Implementation Status

   [NOTE to the RFC Editor: please remove this section before
   publication, as well as the reference to [RFC7942] and
   [github-dtn-bpsec-cose].]

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations can
   exist.

   An example implementation of COSE over Blocks has been created as a
   GitHub project [github-dtn-bpsec-cose] and is intended to use as a
   proof-of-concept and as a possible source of interoperability
   testing.  This example implementation only handles CBOR encoding/
   decoding and cryptographic functions, it does not construct actual
   BIB or BCB and does not integrate with a BP Agent.

6.  Security Considerations

   This section separates security considerations into threat categories
   based on guidance of BCP 72 [RFC3552].

   All of the security considerations of the underlying BPSec
   [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec] apply to these new security contexts.

6.1.  Threat: BPSec Block Replay

   The bundle's primary block contains fields which uniquely identify a
   bundle: the Source Node ID, Creation Timestamp, and fragment
   parameters (see Section 4.2.2 of [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis]).  These same
   fields are used to correlate Administrative Records with the bundles
   for which the records were generated.  Including the primary block in
   the AAD for BPSec integrity and confidentiality binds the
   verification of the secured block to its parent bundle and disallows
   replay of any block with its BIB or BCB.

   This profile of COSE limits the encryption algorithms to only AEAD in
   order to include the context of the encrypted data as AAD.  If an
   agent mistakenly allows the use of non-AEAD encryption when
   decrypting and verifying a BCB, the possibility of block replay
   attack is present.

6.2.  Threat: Unidentifiable Key

   The profile in Section 4.3 recommends key identifiers when possible
   and the parameters in section Section 4.1 allow encoding public keys
   where available.  If the application using a COSE Integrity or COSE
   Confidentiality context leaves out key identification data (in a COSE
   recipient structure), the security acceptor for those BPSec blocks
   only has the primary block available to use when verifying or
   decrypting the target block.  This leads to a situation, identified
   in BPSec Security Considerations, where a signature is verified to be
   valid but not from the expected Security Source.

6.3.  Threat: Algorithm Vulnerabilities

   Because this use of COSE leaves the specific algorithms chosen for
   BIB and BCB use up to the applications securing bundle data, it is
   important to use only COSE algorithms which are marked as recommended
   in the IANA registry [IANA-COSE].

7.  IANA Considerations

   Registration procedures referred to in this section are defined in
   [RFC8126].

7.1.  BPSec Security Contexts

   Within the "Bundle Protocol" registry [IANA-BUNDLE], the following
   entry has been added to the "BPSec Security Context Identifiers" sub-
   registry.

A.2.  RSA Keypair COSE_Sign1

   This is an example of a signature with implied recipient (and its key
   material).  The provided figures are extended diagnostic notation
   [RFC8610].

   The 512-bit private key used is below.  It is not supposed to be a
   secure configuration, only intended to explain the procedure.  This
   signature uses zero-length salt for deterministic output, which
   differs from the parameter specified by [RFC8230] and is not
   recommended for normal use.
