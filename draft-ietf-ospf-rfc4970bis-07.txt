    Extensions to OSPF for Advertising Optional Router Capabilities
                   draft-ietf-ospf-rfc4970bis-07.txt

Abstract

   It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain to
   know the capabilities of their neighbors and other routers in the
   routing domain.  This document proposes extensions to OSPFv2 and
   OSPFv3 for advertising optional router capabilities.  The Router
   Information (RI) Link State Advertisement (LSA) is defined for this
   purpose.  In OSPFv2, the RI LSA will be implemented with an opaque
   LSA type ID.  In OSPFv3, the RI LSA will be implemented with a unique
   LSA type function code.  In both protocols, the RI LSA can be
   advertised at any of the defined flooding scopes (link, area, or
   autonomous system (AS)).  This document obsoletes RFC 4970 by
   providing a revised specification including support for advertisement
   of multiple instances of the RI LSA and a TLV for functional
   capabilities.

1.  Introduction

   It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 [OSPF] or OSPFv3 [OSPFV3]
   routing domain to know the capabilities of their neighbors and other
   routers in the routing domain.  This can be useful for both the
   advertisement and discovery of OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 capabilities.

Internet-Draft         OSPF Capability Extensions           October 2015


   Throughout this document, OSPF will be used when the specification is
   applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  Similarly, OSPFv2 or OSPFv3
   will be used when the text is protocol specific.

   OSPF uses the options field in LSAs and hello packets to advertise
   optional router capabilities.  In the case of OSPFv2, all the bits in
   this field have been allocated so additional optional capabilities
   cannot be advertised.  This document describes extensions to OSPF to
   advertise these optional capabilities via opaque LSAs in OSPFv2 and
   LSAs with a unique type in OSPFv3.  For existing OSPF capabilities,
   backwards compatibility issues dictate that this advertisement is
   used primarily for informational purposes.  For future OSPF
   extensions, this advertisement MAY be used as the sole mechanism for
   advertisement and discovery.

   This document obsoletes RFC 4970 by providing a revised specification
   including support for advertisement of multiple instances of the RI
   LSA and a TLV for functional capabilities.

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-KEYWORDS].

1.2.  Summary of Changes from RFC 4970

   This document includes the following changes from RFC 4970 [RFC4970]:

   1.  The main change is that an OSPF router will be able to advertise
       multiple instances of the OSPF Router Information LSA.  This
       change permeates through much of the document

   2.  Additionally, Section 2.5 includes an additional TLV for
       functional capabilities.  This is in contrast to the existing TLV
       which is used to advertise capabilities for informational
       purposes only.

   3.  The IANA allocation policy for the OSPFv3 LSA Function Code
       registry and all the OSPF Router Information IANA registries has
       been changed from "Standards Action" to "IETF Review"
       [IANA-GUIDE].

   4.  Finally, references have been updated for drafts that have become
       RFCs and RFCs that have been obsoleted since the publication of
       RFC 4970.

2.  OSPF Router Information (RI) LSA

2.1.  OSPFv2 Router Information (RI) Opaque LSA

   OSPFv2 routers will advertise a link scoped, area-scoped, or AS-
   scoped Opaque-LSA [OPAQUE].  The OSPFv2 Router Information (RI) LSA
   has an Opaque type of 4 and the Opaque ID is the RI LSA instance ID.
   The first Opaque ID, i.e., 0, SHOULD always contain the Router
   Informational Capabilities TLV and, if advertised, the Router
   Functional Capabilities TLV.  RI LSA instances subsequent to the
   first can be used for information that doesn't fit in the first
   instance.

   OSPFv2 routers will advertise a link scoped, area-scoped, or AS-
   scoped Opaque-LSA [OPAQUE].  The OSPFv2 Router Information LSA has an
   Opaque type of 4 and Opaque ID specifies the LSA instance ID with the
   first instance always having an Instance ID of 0.

   flooded even if it is not understood.  The Link State ID (LSID) value
   for this LSA is the instance ID.  The first instance ID, i.e., 0,
   SHOULD always contain the Router Informational Capabilities TLV and,
   if advertised, the Router Functional Capabilities TLV.  OSPFv3 Router
   Information LSAs subsequence to the first can be used for information
   that doesn't fit in the first instance.  OSPFv3 routers MAY advertise
   multiple RI LSAs per flooding scope.

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                                TLV Format

   The Length field defines the length of the value portion in octets
   (thus a TLV with no value portion would have a length of 0).  The TLV
   is padded to 4-octet alignment; padding is not included in the length
   field (so a 3-octet value would have a length of 3, but the total
   size of the TLV would be 8 octets).  Nested TLVs are also 4-octet
   aligned.  For example, a 1-octet value would have the length field
   set to 1, and 3 octets of padding would be added to the end of the
   value portion of the TLV.  The padding is composed of undefined bits.
   Unrecognized types are ignored.

   When a new Router Information LSA TLV is defined, the specification
   MUST explicitly state whether the TLV is applicable to OSPFv2 only,
   OSPFv3 only, or both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

2.4.  OSPF Router Informational Capabilities TLV

   An OSPF router advertising an OSPF RI LSA MAY include the Router
   Informational Capabilities TLV.  If included, it MUST be the first
   TLV in the first instance, i.e., instance 0, of the OSPF RI LSA.
   Additionally, the TLV MUST accurately reflect the OSPF router's
   capabilities in the scope advertised.  However, the informational
   capabilities advertised have no impact on OSPF protocol operation,
   they are advertised purely for informational purposes.

   The format of the Router Informational Capabilities TLV is as
   follows:

               portion in octets and will be a multiple of 4 octets
               dependent on the number of capabilities advertised.
               Initially, the length will be 4, denoting 4 octets of
               informational capability bits.

      Value    A variable length sequence of capability bits rounded
               to a multiple of 4 octets padded with undefined bits.
               Initially, there are 4 octets of capability bits.  Bits
               are numbered left-to-right starting with the most
               significant bit being bit 0.


                OSPF Router Informational Capabilities TLV

   The Router Informational Capabilities TLV MAY be followed by optional
   TLVs that further specify a capability.

2.5.  Assigned OSPF Router Informational Capability Bits

   The following informational capability bits are assigned:

2.6.  OSPF Router Functional Capabilities TLV

   This specification also defines the Router Functional Capabilities
   TLV for advertisement within the OSPF Router Information LSA.  An
   OSPF router advertising an OSPF RI LSA MAY include the Router
   Functional Capabilities TLV.  If included, it MUST be the included in
   the first instance of the LSA.  Additionally, the TLV MUST reflect
   the advertising OSPF router's actual functional capabilities since
   the information will be used to dictate OSPF protocol operation in
   the flooding-scope of the containing OSPF RI LSA.  If the TLV is not
   included or the length doesn't include the assigned OSPF functional
   capability bit, the corresponding OSPF functional capability is
   implicitly advertised as not being supported by the advertising OSPF
   router.

   The format of the Router Functional Capabilities TLV is as follows:


       0                   1                   2                   3

      Type     A 16-bit field set to IANA TBD (Suggested value 2).

      Length   A 16-bit field that indicates the length of the value
               portion in octets and will be a multiple of 4 octets
               dependent on the number of capabilities advertised.
               Initially, the length will be 4, denoting 4 octets of
               informational capability bits.

      Value    A variable length sequence of capability bits rounded
               to a multiple of 4 octets padded with undefined bits.
               Initially, there are 4 octets of capability bits.  Bits
               are numbered left-to-right starting with the most
               significant bit being bit 0.

                  OSPF Router Functional Capabilities TLV

   The Router Functional Capabilities TLV MAY be followed by optional
   TLVs that further specify a capability.  In contrast to the Router
   Informational Capabilities TLV, the OSPF extensions advertised in
   this TLV MAY be used by other OSPF routers to dictate protocol
   operation.  The specifications for functional capabilities advertised

   in this TLV MUST describe protocol behavior and address backwards
   compatibility.

2.7.  Flooding Scope of the Router Information LSA

   The flooding scope for a Router Information LSA is determined by the
   LSA type.  For OSPFv2, type 9 (link-scoped), type 10 (area-scoped),
   or a type 11 (AS-scoped) opaque LSA may be flooded.  For OSPFv3, the
   S1 and S2 bits in the LSA type determine the flooding scope.  If AS-
   wide flooding scope is chosen, the originating router should also
   advertise area-scoped LSA(s) into any attached Not-So-Stubby Area
   (NSSA) area(s).  An OSPF router MAY advertise different capabilities
   when both NSSA area scoped LSA(s) and an AS-scoped LSA are
   advertised.  This allows functional capabilities to be limited in
   scope.  For example, a router may be an area border router but only
   support traffic engineering (TE) in a subset of its attached areas.

   The choice of flooding scope is made by the advertising router and is
   a matter of local policy.  The originating router MAY advertise
   multiple RI LSAs with the same instance ID as long as the flooding
   scopes differ.  TLV flooding scope rules will be specified on a per-
   TLV basis and MUST be specified in the accompanying specifications
   for future Router Information LSA TLVs.

3.  Backwards Compatibility

   For backwards compatibility, previously advertised Router Information
   TLVs SHOULD continue to be advertised in the first instance, i.e., 0,
   of the Router Information LSA.  If a Router Information TLV is
   advertised in multiple Router Information LSA instances and the
   multiple instance processing is not explicitly specified in the RFC
   defining that Router Information TLV, the Router Instance TLV in the
   Router Information LSA with the numerically smallest Instance ID will
   be used and subsequent instances will be ignored.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document describes both a generic mechanism for advertising
   router capabilities and a TLV for advertising informational and
   functional capability bits.  The capability TLVs are less critical
   than the topology information currently advertised by the base OSPF
   protocol.  The security considerations for the generic mechanism are
   dependent on the future application and, as such, should be described
   as additional capabilities are proposed for advertisement.  Security
   considerations for the base OSPF protocol are covered in [OSPF] and
   [OSPFV3].

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  OSPFv2 Opaque LSA Type Assignment

   [RFC4970] defined the Router Information opaque LSA as type 4 in the
   Opaque Link-State Advertisements (LSA) Option Types Registry.  IANA
   is asked to update the reference for that entry to point to this RFC.

5.2.  OSPFv3 LSA Function Code Assignment

   [RFC4970]  created the registry for OSPFv3 LSA Function Codes.  IANA
   is requested to update the reference for that registry to point to
   this RFC.  References within that registry to [RFC4970] should be
   updated to point to this RFC; references to other RFCs are unchanged.
   The definition and assignment policy has been updated as follows.

   This registry is now comprised of the fields Value, LSA function code
   name, and Document Reference.  The OSPFv3 LSA function code is
   defined in section A.4.2.1 of [OSPFV3].  The OSPFv3 LSA function code
   12 has been reserved for the OSPFv3 Router Information (RI) LSA.  The
   assignment policy has been updated for the range 16-255.

        +-----------+-------------------------------------+
        | Range     | Assignment Policy                   |

        +-----------+-------------------------------------+

                         OSPFv3 LSA Function Codes

   o  OSPFv3 LSA function codes in the range 16-255 are to be assigned
      subject to IETF Review.  New values are assigned only through RFCs

      that have been shepherded through the IESG as AD- Sponsored or
      IETF WG Documents [IANA-GUIDE].

   o  OSPFv3 LSA function codes in the range 8176-8181 are for
      experimental use; these will not be registered with IANA and MUST
      NOT be mentioned by RFCs.

   o  OSPFv3 LSAs with an LSA Function Code in the Vendor Private Use
      range 8184-8191 MUST include the Enterprise Code [ENTERPRISE-CODE]
      as the first 4 octets following the 20 octets of LSA header.

   o  If a new LSA Function Code is documented, the documentation MUST
      include the valid combinations of the U, S2, and S1 bits for the
      LSA.  It SHOULD also describe how the Link State ID is to be
      assigned.

5.3.  OSPF RI LSA TLV Type Assignment

   [RFC4970] created the registry for OSPF Router Information (RI) TLVs.
   IANA is requested to update the reference for this registry to point
   to this RFC.  The definition and assignment policy has been updated
   as follows.  References within that registry to [RFC4970] should be
   updated to point to this RFC; references to other RFCs are unchanged.
   The definition and assignment policy has been updated as follows.

   The registry is now comprised of the fields Value, TLV Name, and
   Document Reference.  The value of 1 for the informational
   capabilities TLV is defined herein.  The value IANA TBD (suggested
   value 2) for the Router Functional Capabilities TLV is also defined
   herein.

                               OSPF RI TLVs

   o  Types in the range 2, 10-32767 are to be assigned subject to IETF
      Review.  New values are assigned only through RFCs that have been
      shepherded through the IESG as AD-Sponsored or IETF WG Documents
      [IANA-GUIDE].

   o  Types in the range 32778-65535 are reserved and are not to be

      range, there MUST be a Standards Track RFC that specifies IANA
      Considerations that covers the range being assigned.

5.4.  Registry for OSPF RI Informational Capability Bits

   [RFC4970] created the registry for OSPF Router Informational
   Capability Bits.  IANA is requested to update the reference for this
   registry to point to this RFC.  The definition and assignment policy
   has been updated as follows.

   o  This registry is now comprised of the fields Bit Number,
      Capability Name, and Document Reference.

   o  The values are defined in Section 2.4.  All Router Informational
      Capability TLV additions are to be assigned through IETF Review
