Abstract

   This document defines a format for OSI NSAP Addresses for use where
   TCP or UDP is used to provide the OSI Network Service over IPv6, as
   in RFC 2126 (ISO Transport Service on top of TCP (ITOT)).  This
   requires encoding of an IPv6 address and a port number in the NSAP.
   RFC 1277 defines an NSAP format for use with IPv4 addresses, and this
   document updates RFC 1277 to allow for IPv6 addresses.

1.1.   Conventions Used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].

   Editorial comments/questions or missing paragraphs are marked in the
   text with << and >>.


1.2.   Rationale

   [ITOT] defines a mechanism for the OSI upper layers to use Transport
   Classes 0 and 2 using TCP as the Network Service. In this case the
   Network Service Access Point (NSAP) address is effectively defined by
   the IP address and TCP port number.

   It would be possible to have a local mechanism to map from arbitrary
   network addresses to the required TCP/IP information. However, this
   is not practical for wide-area connections. Therefore, a mechanism
   which encodes the TCP/IP addressing information with the NSAP address
   is to be preferred. [RFC1277] provides such an embedding mechanism.
   However, it only supports IPv4 addresses.

   There are places where NSAP addresses are carried in protocol. The
   preferred concrete syntax for NSAP addresses uses 20 octets. IPv6
   addresses are 16 octets long, and TCP port numbers require 2 octets.
   Therefore there are only two octets free to define the address
   ([ISO8348]).

   [RFC1888] defines a format for embedding IPv6 addresses into NSAP
   addresses. However, this format defines a IDI of two octets, leaving
   one octet for the network selector. So there is insufficient space in
   the network selector for the TCP port number. To use the domain
   identifier for part of the TCP port number does not seem an elegant
   solution.

   However, this NSAP address format could be used if the default port
   for the service is implied. Implementations of ITOT SHOULD interpret
   NSAP addresses in this format as implying the use of IPv6 with the
   default port.

   The only other defined Authority and Format Indicator (AFI) which
   leaves suffient space for both an IPv6 address and TCP port number is
   the binary local AFI (49). However, using this format may conflict
   with other uses of this AFI on some systems, if they support multiple
   network services and the local AFI is use on one of these.

   Therefore, in order to support OSI transport over IPv6 to non-default
   ports we need a new NSAP address format.


2.   NSAPA for IPv6 address and port

   The Initial Domain Part (IDP) consists of one octet AFI (<<to be
   allocated by ITU-T>>) and a one octet IDI. The IDI is used to
   distinguish different uses of the address and port contained in the
   Domain Specific Part. For ITOT, the IDI value of 0 is used. Further
   values for this field are to be assigned by the IANA on an IETF
   consensus basis [RFC2434].

   The Domain Specific Part (DSP) consists of two fields: 16 octet IPv6
   address in network byte order, followed by 2 octet port number in
   network byte order. The TCP port number takes over the function of
   the network selector. If the port number field is 0, the port number
   defaults to the value defined in [ITOT].

   An NSAPA with the <<TBD>> AFI code is converted to an IPv6 address by
   stripping off the first and the twentieth octets.

3.   Security Considerations

   <<Security issues are not specifically addressed in this document,
   but it is compatible with the IPv6 security mechanisms [RFC2401].>>


4.   IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add AFI <<TBD>> to the registry of the OSI
   NSAPAs:
    <http://www.iana.org/assignments/osi-nsapa-numbers>.

   The following IDI should be registered under this AFI:

   <<This needs some communication with ITU-T to allocate a new AFI and

   Remaining decimal values '1' through '99'<<?>> MUST be assigned on an
   IETF consensus basis [RFC2434].
