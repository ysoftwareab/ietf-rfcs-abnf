     The IPv6 Address-based DHCPv6 Unique Identifier (DUID-V6ADDR)
                       draft-templin-duid-ipv6-01

Abstract

   This document defines a new DHCPv6 Unique Identifier (DUID) type
   called DUID-V6ADDR that contains a single 128 bit IPv6 address.
   DUID-V6ADDR makes it possible for devices to use suitably-derived
   unique IPv6 addresses to identify themselves to DHCPv6 servers and/or
   other network nodes.

1.  Introduction

   DHCP Unique Identifiers (DUIDs) are used in DHCPv6 control messages
   [RFC8415] to identify clients and servers (they may also be used in
   other protocol messages that import the format such as IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery (IPv6 ND) [RFC4861]).  This document defines a new DUID
   type containing a single valid IPv6 address [RFC8200] that has been
   suitably derived through some means to ensure uniqueness.  The new
   DUID type is termed DUID-V6ADDR.

   Some methods of producing unique identifiers take care to ensure that
   the identifier is included in a well-formed IPv6 address.  For
   example, the Host Identity Tag (HIT) [RFC7401][I-D.ietf-drip-rid] is
   a valid IPv6 address and therefore occupies the same 128-bit space as
   for any IPv6 address (in network byte order).  Other IPv6 address
   generation methods [RFC7721] also assert uniqueness.  The only
   distinction needed within the DUID space is therefore a new DUID type
   value indicating the presence of a single IPv6 address.

   DUID-V6ADDR allows devices to use suitably-derived IPv6 addresses to
   identify themselves to DHCPv6 servers and vice versa.  The DUID-
   V6ADDR format makes no statement about the method used for generating
   the IPv6 address, but its use in control messages asserts that the
   address has been ensured unique through some unspecified means.
   Valid IPv6 address types include any unicast/anycast Global Unicast
   (GUA), Link-Local (LLA) or Unique-Local (ULA) address, with the
   specific address type identified by the subnet prefix per the IPv6
   addressing architecture [RFC4193][RFC4291].  The following sections
   present the DUID-V6ADDR format and type designation.

2.  Terminology

   IETF keywords appear in [RFC2119][RFC8174].

3.  Background

   In DHCPv6, clients identify themselves to servers via DHCP Unique
   Identifiers (DUIDs) [RFC8415].  DUIDs are identifiers that DHCP
   servers treat as opaque objects with no internal structure.  DUIDs
   are intended to be globally unique, with no two devices using the
   same DUID.

   Four DUIDs types have been defined previously:

   DUID-LLT  the Link-Layer address of one of the device's network
      interfaces, concatenated with a timestamp.

   DUID-EN  an Enterprise Number plus additional information specific to
      the enterprise.

   DUID-LL  the Link-Layer address of one of the device's network
      interfaces.

   DUID-UUID  used in situations where there is a Universally Unique
      IDentifier (UUID) stored in a device's firmware settings
      [RFC6355].

   This document specifies a fifth DUID type, known as DUID-V6ADDR and
   identified by DUID-Type value TBD which distinguishes it from all
   other types.  (Note: The DUID Type value allocation policy per IANA
   is "Standards Action".)

4.  DUID-V6ADDR Format

   The DUID-V6ADDR is carried within control messages.  It has the
   following format:

      DUID-Type - DUID-V6ADDR (TBD) - (16 bits)

      IPv6 Address - An IPv6 Address (128 bits)

5.  DUID-V6ADDR Uses

   The DUID-V6ADDR may appear in DHCPv6 and/or other protocol control
   messages (such as IPv6 ND) within a service domain when a unique ID
   based on an IPv6 address is required.  Clients and servers include a
   unique GUA/LLA/ULA as the IPv6 address according to the domain
   service model, where GUAs are assumed globally unique while LLAs and
   ULAs are assumed unique within the service domain but not necessarily
   globally unique.  If multiple nodes within the service domain include
   the same GUA/LLA/ULA, the address assumes the properties of an
   anycast address.

   DUID-V6ADDR uses for IPv6 address types other than GUA/LLA/ULA are
   out of scope.

6.  Relation to Other DUID Types

   DUID-V6ADDR differs in size, format and contents from DUID-LLT, DUID-
   EN and DUID-LL.  DUID-V6ADDR shares the same size and format as DUID-
   UUID, however DUID-UUID includes a UUID which is by definition not an
   IPv6 address.  (A case could be considered for allowing the existing
   DUID-UUID format to also include an IPv6 address (i.e., instead of a
   UUID), however this would require a domain-wide observation of the
   alternate use.  It would further not be possible for software to
   distinguish a UUID from an IPv6 address, since UUIDs by definition do
   not honor the IPv6 addressing architecture.)

7.  IPv6 Address Generation Method-Specific DUID Types

   An alternative to defining a generic DUID-V6ADDR type for all manners
   of IPv6 addresses would be to define a specific DUID type for each
   IPv6 address generation method.  This would result in the assignment
   of additional DUID type values as more and more IPv6 address
   generation methods become standards.

   While the DUID type value assigned number space is not a scarce
   commodity, assigning a new DUID type value for each new IPv6 address
   generation method as they become standards would require updates to
   widely-deployed legacy systems that only care that a valid IPv6
   address is included and do not need to know the address generation
   method used.

   It should also be noted that different unique IPv6 address generation
   methods must presumably use a distinct IPv6 subnet prefix not shared
   by other address generation methods in order to avoid duplication.
   Hence, implementations that need to know the address generation
   method used can examine the IPv6 address subnet prefix in the DUID-
   V6ADDR in order to determine the address generation method.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a value TBD in the 'dhcpv6-parameters'
   registry for DUID-V6ADDR.

9.  Security Considerations

   DHCP and other control message traffic such as IPv6 ND are sent in
   the clear.  An eavesdropper residing on the path could therefore
   examine the traffic and obtain the unique IPv6 address asserted by a
   particular machine.  This may raise some privacy issues but is not a
   new issue brought on by the use of the DUID type defined in this
   document.
