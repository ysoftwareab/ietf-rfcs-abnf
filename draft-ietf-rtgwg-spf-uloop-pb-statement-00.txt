Abstract

   A micro-loop is a packet forwarding loop that may occur transiently
   among two or more routers in a hop-by-hop packet forwarding paradigm.

   In this document, we are trying to analyze the impact of using
   different Link State IGP implementations in a single network in
   regards of microloops.  The analysis is focused on the SPF triggers
   and SPF delay algorithm.

1.  Introduction

   Link State IGP protocols are based on a topology database on which a
   SPF (Shortest Path First) algorithm like Dijkstra is implemented to
   find the optimal routing paths.

   Specifications like IS-IS ([RFC1195]) propose some optimization of
   the route computation (See Appendix C.1) but not all the
   implementations are following those not mandatory optimizations.

   We will call SPF trigger, the events that would lead to a new SPF
   computation based on the topology.

   Link State IGP protocols, like OSPF ([RFC2328]) and IS-IS
   ([RFC1195]), are using plenty of timers to control the router
   behavior in case of churn : SPF delay, PRC delay, LSP generation
   delay, LSP flooding delay, LSP retransmission interval ...

   Some of those timers are standardized in protocol specification, some
   are not especially the SPF computation related timers.

   For non standardized timers, implementations are free to implement it
   in any way.  For some standardized timer, we can also see that rather
   than using static configurable values for such timer ,
   implementations may offer dynamically adjusted timers to help
   controlling the churn.

   We will call SPF delay, the delay timer that exists in most
   implementations that makes codes to wait before running SPF
   computation after a SPF trigger is received.

   A micro-loop is a packet forwarding loop that may occur transiently
   among two or more routers in a hop-by-hop packet forwarding paradigm.
   We can observe that these micro-loops are formed when two routers do
   not update their Forwarding Information Base (FIB) for a certain
   prefix at the same time.  The micro-loop phenomenon is described in
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-microloop-analysis].

   Routers have more and more powerful controlplane and dataplane that
   reduce the Control plane to Forwarding plane overhead during the
   convergence process.  Even if FIB update is still reasonably the
   highest contributor in the convergence time for large network, its
   duration is reducing more and more and may become comparable to
   protocol timers.  This is particular true in small and medium
   networks.

   In multi vendor networks, using different implementations of a link
   state protocol may favor micro-loops creation during convergence time
   due to deprecancies of timers.  Service Providers are already aware
   to use similar timers for all the network as best practice, but
   sometimes it is not possible due to limitation of implementations.

   This document will present why it sounds important for service
   provider to have consistent implementations of Link State protocols
   across vendors.  We are particularly analyzing the impact of using
   different Link State IGP implementations in a single network in
   regards of microloops.  The analysis is focused on the SPF triggers
   and SPF delay algorithm in a first step.

   This document is only stating the problem, and defining some work
   items but its not intented to provide a solution.

                                           Figure 1

   In the figure above, A uses primarily the AC link to reach C.  When
   the AC link fails, IGP convergence occurs.  If A converges before B,
   A will forward traffic to C through B, but as B as not converged yet,
   B will loop back traffic to A, leading to a microloop.

   The micro-loop appears due to the asynchronous convergence of nodes
   in a network when a event occurs.

   Multiple factors (and combination of these factors) may increase the
   probability for a micro-loop to appear :

   o  delay of failure notification : the more B is advised of the
      failure later than A, the more a micro-loop may appear.

   o  SPF delay : most of the implementations supports a delay for the
      SPF computation to try to catch as many events as possible.  If A
      uses a SPF delay timer of x msec and B uses a SPF delay timer of y
      msec and x < y, B would start converging after A leading to a
      potential microloop.

   o  SPF computation time : mostly a matter of CPU power and
      optimizations like incremental SPF.  If A computes SPF faster than
      B, there is a chance for a microloop to appear.  CPUs are today
      faster enough to consider SPF computation time as negligeable
      (order of msec in a large network).

   o  RIB and FIB prefix insertion speed or ordering : highly
      implementation dependant.

   This document will focus on analysis SPF delay (and associated
   triggers).

3.  SPF trigger strategies

   Depending of the change advertised in LSP/LSA, the topology may be
   affected or not.  An implementation can decide to not run SPF (and
   only run IP reachability) if the advertised change is not affecting
   topology.

   Different strategies exists to trigger SPF :

   1.  Always run full SPF whatever the change to process.

   2.  Run only Full SPF when required : e.g. if a link fails, a local
       node will run an SPF for its local LSP update.  If the LSP from
       the neighbor (describing the same failure) is received after SPF
       has started, the local node can decide that a new full SPF is not
       required as the topology has not change.

   3.  If topology does not change, only recompute reachability.

   As pointed in Section 1, SPF optimization are not mandatory in
   specifications, leading to multiple strategies to be implemented.

4.  SPF delay strategies

   Implementations of link state routing protocols use different
   strategies to delay SPF :

   1.  Two steps.

   2.  Exponential backoff.

4.1.  Two step SPF delay

   The SPF delay is managed by four parameters :

   o  Rapid delay : amount of time to wait before running SPF.

   o  Rapid runs : amount of consecutive SPF runs that can run using
      rapid delay.  When amount is exceeded router moves to slow delay.

   o  Slow delay : amount of time to wait before running SPF.

   o  Wait time : amount of time to wait without events before going
      back to rapid delay.

   Example : Rapid delay = 50msec, Rapid runs = 3, Slow delay = 1sec,
   Wait time = 2sec

4.2.  Exponential backoff

   The algorithm has two mode : fast mode and backoff mode.  In backoff
   mode, the SPF delay is increasing exponentially at each run.  The SPF
   delay is managed by four parameters :

   o  First delay : amount of time to wait before running SPF.  This
      delay is used on when SPF is in fast mode.

   o  Incremental delay : amount of time to wait before running SPF.
      This delay is used on when SPF is in backoff mode and increments
      exponentially at each SPF run.

   o  Maximum delay : maximum amount of time to wait before running SPF.

   o  Wait time : amount of time to wait without events before going
      back to fast mode.

   Example : First delay = 50msec, Incremental delay = 50msec, Maximum
   delay = 1sec, Wait time = 2sec

   In the diagram above, we consider a flow of packet from S to D.  We
   consider that S is using optimized SPF triggering (Full SPF is
   triggered only when necessary), and two steps SPF delay
   (rapid=150ms,rapid-runs=3, slow=1s).  As implementation of S is
   optimized, Partial Reachability Computation (PRC) is available.  We
   consider the same timers as SPF for delaying PRC.  We consider that E
   is using a SPF trigger strategy that always compute Full SPF and
   exponential backoff strategy for SPF delay (start=150ms, inc=150ms,
   max=1s)

   We also consider the following sequence of events (note : the
   timescale does not intend to represent a real router timescale where
   jitters are introduced to all timers) :

   o  t0+200ms : the prefix is declared as up.

   o  t0+400ms : a prefix is declared down in the network.

   o  t0+1000ms : S-D link fails.

                       Figure 3


   In the figure above, we can see that due to deprecancies in SPF
   management, after multiple events (different types of event), SPF
   delays are completely misaligned between nodes leading to long
   microloop creation.

   The same issue can also appear with only single type of events as
   displayed below :

6.  Proposed work items

   In order to enhance the current LinkState IGP behavior, authors would
   encourage working on standardization of some behaviors.

   Authors are proposing the following work items :

   o  Standardize SPF trigger strategy.

   o  Standardize computation timer scope : single timer for all
      computation operations, separated timers ...

   o  Standardize "slowdown" timer algorithm including its association
      to a particular timer : authors of this document does not presume
      that the same algorithm must be used for all timers.

   Using the same event sequence as in figure 2, we may expect fewer
   and/or shorter microloops using standardized implementations.

   As displayed above, there could be some other parameters like router
   computation power, flooding timers that may also influence
   microloops.  In the figure 5, we consider E to be a bit slower than
   S, leading to microloop creation.  Despite of this, we expect that by
   aligning implementations at least on SPF trigger and SPF delay,
   service provider may reduce number or duration of microloops.
