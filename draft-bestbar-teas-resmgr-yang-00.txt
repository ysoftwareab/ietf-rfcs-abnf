       A YANG Data Model for Network Resource Reservation Manager
                   draft-bestbar-teas-resmgr-yang-00

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model for the network Resource
   Reservation Manager (RRM).  The RRM can be deployed to manage set of
   network resources scoped to a node, a region of a network, a domain
   of the network, or globally for all resources in a network.

   This model covers data for configuration, operational state, remote
   procedural calls pertaining to links managed by the RRM.

1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] and [RFC7950] is a data modeling language that was
   introduced to define the contents of a conceptual data store that
   allows networked devices to be managed using NETCONF [RFC6241].  YANG
   data models can be used as the basis of implementation for other
   interfaces, such as gRPC, CLI and other programmatic APIs.

   This document describes YANG data model for the Resource Reservation
   Manager (RRM).  The RRM can be deployed to manage set of network
   resources scoped to a node, a region of a network, a domain of the
   network, or globally for all resources in a network.

   The RRM can acquire topological elements and their attributes from
   the devices using routing protocols or another suitable interface to
   the network devices.  An aggregate view of the dynamic resource
   reservation state on links managed by the RRM can be downloaded to
   the device.  The device can then disseminate the dynamic link state
   to the network using known means (e.g. link state protocols).  The
   headend or Path Computation Engine (PCE) can update their topologies
   with current network state and use it to make further for path
   computations.

   It is possible to deploy multiple instances of RRM to service
   different parts of the network.  For example, a per-domain RRM may be
   deployed to service requests within a domain.  A per-node RRM
   instance may be deployed to manage resources specific to a node.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are used in this
   specification:

   o  client

   o  configuration data

   o  state data

   This document also makes use of the following terminology introduced
   in the YANG Data Modeling Language [RFC7950]:

   o  augment

   o  data model

   o  data node

2.1.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects
   are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG imported modules, as shown in Table 1.

2.2.  Model Tree Diagrams

   The tree diagrams extracted from the module(s) defined in this
   document are given in subsequent sections as per the syntax defined
   in [RFC8340].

3.  Design Considerations

   The following other design considerations are taken into account with
   respect data organization:

   o  In general, minimal elements in the model are designated as
      "mandatory" to allow freedom to vendors to adapt the data model to
      their specific product implementation.

   o  For optional data nodes, default values are specified when multi-
      vendor implementations can agree on the default behavior.

   o  The Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342]
      addresses modeling state data for ephemeral objects.  This
      document adopts the NMDA model for configuration and state data
      representation as per IETF guidelines for new IETF YANG models.

4.  Network Resource Reservation Manager YANG Model

   The network RRM YANG module ('ietf-resmgr') is meant to manage
   resource reservation on a set of resources of a network.

   This includes admitting and releasing paths on specific links and
   nodes managed by the RRM.

4.1.  Module Structure

   The 'ietf-resmgr' structured hierarchically.  The set of network
   resources managed by the RRM are organized by domain and node
   membership.

   domains:

      A YANG container that includes the list of domain resources
      managed by this RRM.

   nodes:

      A YANG container that includes the list of node resources under a
      specific domain that are managed by this RRM.

   links:

      A YANG container that includes the list of link resources under a
      specific node in a domain that are managed by this RRM.

   path-admit:

      A Remote Procedure Call (RPC) to request path admission of a
      specific path on a set of network resources managed by this RRM.

   topology-update:

      An RPC to request a addition or removal of a network element whose
      resources are managed by this RRM.

                   Figure 2: The network RRM YANG module

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following URIs in the IETF XML registry
   [RFC3688].  Following the format in [RFC3688], the following
   registrations are requested to be made.

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-resmgr
      Registrant Contact:  The IESG.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers two YANG modules in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].

      Name:       ietf-resmgr
      Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-resmgr
      Prefix:     rrm
      Reference:  RFCXXXX


6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)

   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   "/resmgr/topology-filters": This container and any of its
   encompassing data nodes defines the filter for the network resources
   managed by this RRM.  Unauthorized access to this list could cause
   the RRM to ignore some network resources and could cause preemptions
   and disruptions in the network.

   "/resmgr/domains": This container and any of its encompassing data
   nodes represent the set of network resources managed by this RRM.
   Unauthorized access to this list could cause the RRM to preempt
   existing path and causing disruptions to existing services in the
   network.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability.

   Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   "path-admit": using this RPC, an attacker can attempt to deplete
   certain network resources managed by this RRM.  Also, it is possible
   for an attacker to preempt existing admitted paths on a set of
   resources by sending higher priority requests on the same set of
   network resources.  This may affect paths that can be carrying live
   traffic, and hence may result in interruptions to services carried
   over the network.

   "topology-update": using this RPC, an attacker can attempt to delete
   certain network resources that are already managed by this RRM.  This
   may result in preemption of existing paths admitted on those network
   resources and result in interruptions to services carried over the
   network.

   The security considerations spelled out in the YANG 1.1 specification
   [RFC7950] apply for this document as well.
