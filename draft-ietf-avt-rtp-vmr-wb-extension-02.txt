Abstract

   This document is an addendum to RFC xxxx, which specifies the 
   RTP payload format for the Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB) 
   speech codec. This document specifies some updates in RFC xxxx to 
   enable support for the new operating mode of VMR-WB standard (i.e., 
   VMR-WB mode 4). These updates do not affect the existing modes of 
   VMR-WB already specified in RFC xxxx. 

   The payload formats and their associated parameters, as well as all 
   provisions, restrictions, use cases, features, etc. that are 
   specified in RFC xxxx are applicable to the new operating mode with 
   no exception.

1. Introduction

   This document is an addendum to RFC xxxx [2] and contains the
   necessary updates for the support of the new operating mode of 3GPP2 
   VMR-WB standard [1]. The new mode of VMR-WB standard; i.e., VMR-WB
   mode 4, while operating at a lower data rate, has similar 
   characteristics and functionalities compared to the existing modes 
   of VMR-WB already included in RFC xxxx (e.g., variable bit rate, 
   narrowband/wideband input/output speech/audio processing capability, 
   continuous and discontinuous transmission, etc.). Therefore, all 
   provisions and restrictions specified in RFC xxxx are applicable to 
   all modes of the VMR-WB standard including the new mode, which is 
   specified in this document. As a result, no new media type 
   registration is required. 

   The VMR-WB file format; i.e., for transport of VMR-WB speech data in 
   storage mode applications, is specified in [1,4] and includes 
   support for the new mode of operation. 

   The following sections provide the necessary updates to 
   RFC xxxx to enable support of VMR-WB mode 4.

   
2. Conventions and Acronyms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [3].

   The following acronyms are used in this document:

    3GPP2  - The Third Generation Partnership Project 2
    CDMA   - Code Division Multiple Access
    VMR-WB - Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband Codec
    CMR    - Codec Mode Request
    DTX    - Discontinuous Transmission

3. The Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB) Extension

   VMR-WB is the wideband speech-coding standard developed by
   Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) for
   encoding/decoding wideband/narrowband speech content in
   multimedia services in 3G CDMA cellular systems [1]. VMR-WB is a
   source-controlled variable-rate multimode wideband speech
   codec. It has a number of operating modes, where each mode is
   a tradeoff between voice quality and average data rate. The
   operating mode in VMR-WB (as shown in Table 2) is chosen based on 
   the traffic condition of the network and the desired quality of 
   service. The desired average data rate (ADR) in each mode
   is obtained by encoding speech frames at permissible rates (as shown 
   in Tables 1 and 3) compliant with cdma2000 system depending on the
   instantaneous characteristics of input speech and the maximum and 
   minimum rate constraints imposed by the network operator.

   The capabilities of the VMR-WB codec were extended through the 
   addition of a new mode operating at lower average data rates, 
   resulting in improved system capacity in IP and non-IP networks [1]. 

   As a result of this extension, certain reserved table entries in 
   RFC xxxx are used to include support for the new operating mode. 
   VMR-WB mode 4 is compliant with all applicable provisions and 
   restrictions specified in RFC xxxx [2]. Note that the existing table 
   entries of RFC xxxx remain unchanged (e.g., frame types, etc.) and 
   the original modes of VMR-WB are not affected by these updates.

   The existing flexibility in RFC xxxx for future extensions allows 
   the addition of the new mode without any impact on the 
   interoperability with earlier implementations of RFC xxxx.

   The following sections provide the necessary updates that are 
   required to be made in RFC xxxx.

   The provisions and considerations for implementation, congestion 
   control, and security remain identical to those specified in
   RFC xxxx. 


4. The Necessary Updates in RFC xxxx

   Table 1 of RFC xxxx is updated as follows:

   operations [2].

Table 3:VMR-WB payload frame types for real-time transport

   Note that the new FT types associated with VMR-WB mode 4 replace the 
   reserved entries 7, 8, and 10 in Table 3 of RFC xxxx and there are 
   no changes in the existing entries of Table 3 of RFC xxxx.

   The 'mode-set' MIME parameter value 4 is defined to indicate that 
   VMR-WB mode 4 is supported and used. Note that the active modes of 
   operation are negotiated and agreed by the IP terminals through the 
   offer-answer model provided in Section 9.3 of RFC xxxx [2].

   Same as RFC xxxx


6. Public specification

   The VMR-WB speech codec including the new mode is specified in 
   following 3GPP2 specification C.S0052-A version 1.0. Transfer 
   methods are specified in RFC xxxx.
