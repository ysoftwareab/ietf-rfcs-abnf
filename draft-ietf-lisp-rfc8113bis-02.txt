Abstract

   This document specifies a Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)
   shared message type for defining future extensions and conducting
   experiments without consuming a LISP packet type codepoint for each
   extension.

   This document obsoletes RFC 8113.

1.  Introduction

   The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) base specification,
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis], defines a set of primitives that are
   identified with a packet type code.  Several extensions have been
   proposed to add more LISP functionalities.  It is expected that
   additional LISP extensions will be proposed in the future.

   The "LISP Packet Types" IANA registry (see Section 5) is used to ease
   the tracking of LISP message types.

   Because of the limited type space [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis] and the
   need to conduct experiments to assess new LISP extensions, this
   document specifies a shared LISP extension message type and describes
   a procedure for registering LISP shared extension sub-types (see
   Section 3).  Concretely, one single LISP message type code is
   dedicated to future LISP extensions; sub-types are used to uniquely
   identify a given LISP extension making use of the shared LISP
   extension message type.  These identifiers are selected by the
   author(s) of the corresponding LISP specification that introduces a
   new LISP extension message type.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  LISP Shared Extension Message Type

   Figure 1 depicts the common format of the LISP shared extension
   message.  The type field MUST be set to 15 (see Section 5).

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |Type=15|        Sub-type       |   extension-specific          |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       //                    extension-specific                       //
       //                                                             //
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

               Figure 1: LISP Shared Extension Message Type

   The "Sub-type" field conveys a unique identifier that MUST be
   registered with IANA (see Section 5.2).

   The exact structure of the 'extension-specific' portion of the
   message is specified in the corresponding specification document.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any additional security issues other
   than those discussed in [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis].

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  LISP Packet Types

   IANA has created a protocol registry for LISP Packet Types, numbered
   0-15.

   The values in the ranges 5-7 and 9-14 can be assigned via Standards
   Action [RFC8126].  Documents that request for a new LISP packet type
   may indicate a preferred value in the corresponding IANA sections.

   IANA is requested to replace the reference to RFC8113 with the RFC
   number to be assigned to this document.

   Also, IANA is requested to update the table as follows:

   Message                           Code    Reference

   ================================= ==== ===============
   LISP Shared Extension Message     15      [ThisDocument]

5.2.  Sub-Types

   IANA has created the "LISP Shared Extension Message Type Sub-types"
   registry.  IANA is requested to update that registry by replacing the
   reference to RFC8113 with the RFC number to be assigned to this
   document.

   The values in the range 0-1023 are assigned via Standards Action.
   This range is provisioned to anticipate, in particular, the
   exhaustion of the LISP Packet types.

   The values in the range 1024-4095 are assigned on a First Come, First
   Served (FCFS) basis.  The registration procedure should provide IANA
   with the desired codepoint and a point of contact; providing a short
   description (together with an acronym, if relevant) of the foreseen
   usage of the extension message is also encouraged.

6.  Changes from RFC 8113

   The following changes were made from RFC 8113:

   o  Change the status from Experimental to Standard track.

   o  Indicate explicitly that the shared extension is used for two
      purposes: extend the type space and conduct experiments to assess
      new LISP extensions.

   o  Delete pointers to some examples illustrating how the shared
      extension message is used to extend the LISP protocol.

   o  Request IANA to update the "IANA LISP Packet Types" and "LISP
      Shared Extension Message Type Sub-types" registries to point to
      this document instead of RFC8113.
