Abstract

   This document defines a new sub-option for the CableLabs Client
   Configuration (CCC) DHCP option code for conveying the network 
   addresses of Key Distribution Center (KDC) servers.

1.  Introduction

   The need for a CCC DHCP Option code is described in [1]. The CCC 
   DHCP option code will be used to address specific needs of CableLabs
   client devices during their configuration processes. This document 
   proposes a sub-option for the CCC DHCP option.

   Internet Draft	  KDC Server Address Sub-option       September 2002
   
   
   Configuration of a class of CableLabs client devices described in 
   [2] requires a DHCP sub-option to provide the client with the 
   network address of a KDC server in the cable operator's data 
   network. The class of devices assumed in [2] is unlike the class
   of devices considered in [1], which perform a DNS lookup of the 
   Kerberos Realm name to find the KDC server network address. 
   
   This document proposes a sub-option of the CCC DHCP option
   code for use with CableLabs client devices. The proposed sub-option
   encodes an identifier for the network address of each of one or more
   Key Distribution Center servers with which the CableLabs client 
   device exchanges security information. 

   CableLabs plans to assign sub-option code ranges for the CCC option 
   according to CableLabs projects. The range (51 - 100) is assigned 
   to the CableHome project. Use of the initial value of this range is
   specified in [2].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and "MAY" 
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].


2.  Key Distribution Center IP Address Sub-option

   The CableHome 1.0 specification [2] specifies the Key Distribution 
   Center network address encoding as a sub-option of the CCC DHCP 
   Option code. This field is used to inform the client device of the
   network address of one or more Key Distribution Center servers. 

   The encoding of the KDC Server Address sub-option will adhere to the 
   format of an IPv4 address using the default port. The minimum length
   for this option is 4 octets, and the length MUST always be a 
   multiple of 4. If multiple KDC Servers are listed, they MUST be
   listed in decreasing order of priority. The format of the KDC Server
   Address sub-option of the CCC option code is as shown below:

    SubOpt  Len      Address 1               Address 2
   +------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
   |  51  |  n  |  a1 |  a2 |  a3 |  a4 |  a1 |  a2 |  ...
   +------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--


3.  Security Considerations

   This document relies upon the DHCP protocol [4] for authentication
   and security, i.e., it does not provide security in excess of what
   DHCP is (or will be) providing. It does not expose any security
   threats beyond what is currently exposed by other DHCP options.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The KDC Server Address sub-option described in this document is 
   intended to be a sub-option of the CableLabs Client Configuration
   (CCC) option described in [1]. IANA will be requested to register
   sub-option code 51 of the CCC option to the KDC Server Address    
   sub-option.
