          Expanded Address Allocation for Private Internets  April 2004 
 
 
Introduction 
    
   A number of organizations have expanded their autonomous private 
   networks to the point of exhausting the address space identified in 
   RFC 1918, in addition to the publicly routed space that has been 
   assigned to them. Given the policies for acquiring additional public 
   space it is not reasonable for them to acquire such space for use in 
   their private networks. 
    
   While it is tempting to tell them to just switch to IPv6, that is not 
   realistic from application availability, and transition timeframe 
   standpoint. They need additional IPv4 space to continue to grow 
   during the transition period. That space should be formally allocated 
   rather than simply taken on the assumption it will not be publicly 
   allocated before they complete a transition to IPv6.  
    
    
Private Address Space 
    
   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the 
   following blocks of the IPv4 address space for private internets: 
    
   x.0.0.0 /8  
   y.0.0.0 /8 
   z.0.0.0 /8 
    
IANA Considerations 
    
   IANA should select additional IPv4 /8's for this purpose from those 
   least likely to be allocated for public use. The prefix 1 /8 is a 
   prime candidate as the author is aware of multiple networks that have 
   historically used it for private use. Another candidate, 223 /8 was 
   recently returned to IANA due to conflicts with RFC 3330.  
    
    
Security Considerations 
    
   While product marketing frequently confuses the use of private 
   address space with security, there are no such claims being made or 
   validated by this document.
