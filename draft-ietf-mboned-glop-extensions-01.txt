3. Abstract

   This memo provides describes the mapping of the GLOP addresses
   [RFC2770] corresponding to the private AS space [RFC1930].


4. Introduction

   RFC 2770 [RFC2770] describes an experimental policy for use of the
   class D address space using 233/8. The technique described there maps
   16 bits of Autonomous System number (AS) into the middle two octets
   of 233/8 to yield a /24. While this technique has been successful,
   the assignments are inefficient in those cases in which a /24 is too
   small or the user doesn't have its own AS.

   RFC 1930 [RFC1930] defines the private AS space to be 64512 through
   65535. This memo expands on RFC 2770 to allow routing registries to
   allocate multicast addresses from the GLOP space corresponding to the
   RFC 1930 private ASes. This space will be refered to as the EGLOP
   (Extended GLOP) address space.


   This memo is a product of the Multicast  Deployment Working Group
   (MBONED) in the Operations and Management Area of the Internet
   Engineering Task Force. Submit comments to <mboned@ns.uoregon.edu> or
   the authors.


   The terms "Specification Required", "Expert Review", "IESG Approval",
   "IETF Consensus", and "Standards Action", are used in this memo to
   refer to the processes described in [RFC2434]. The keywords MUST,
   MUST NOT, MAY, OPTIONAL, REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED, SHALL, SHALL NOT,
   SHOULD, SHOULD NOT are to be interpreted as defined in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

5. Overview

   http://www.iana.org/cgi-bin/multicast.pl defines a mechanism for
   allocation of multicast addresses that are generally for use in
   network control applications (a more general description of these
   policies can be found in [GUIDELINES]). It is envisioned that those
   addresses allocated from the EGLOP space (233.242.0.0 -
   233.255.255.255) will be used by applications that cannot use
   Administratively Scoped Addressing [RFC2365], GLOP Addressing
   [RFC2770], or Source Specific Multicast (SSM) [SSM].


6. Assignment Criteria

   Globally scoped IPv4 multicast addresses in the EGLOP space are
   allocated by a Regional Registry (RIR). An applicant MUST, as per
   [IANA], show that the request cannot be satisfied using
   Administratively Scoped addressing [RFC2365], GLOP addressing
   [RFC2770], or SSM [SSM]. The fine-grained allocation policy is left
   to the allocating RIR.


7. Security Considerations

   Security issues are not discussed in this memo.
