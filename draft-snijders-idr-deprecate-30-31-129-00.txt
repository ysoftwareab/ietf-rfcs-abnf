1.  Introduction

   It has been discovered that certain BGP Path Attribute values have
   been used in BGP implementations which have been deployed in the wild
   while not being assigned by the IANA for such usage.  This has led to
   deployment problems for new technologies such as Large BGP
   Communities [I-D.ietf-idr-large-community].

   The squatting of values 30, 31 and 129 has been confirmed by the
   involved vendors.

2.  IANA Considerations

   Per this document, IANA has marked the BGP Path Attributes registry
   entries for values 30, 31, 129 as "deprecated".

3.  Security Considerations

   There are no meaningful security consequences arising from this
   registry update.
