Internet-Draft      Extension to RSVP-TE for Hose VPN       January 2010


1.  Introduction

   To solve the resource provisioning in virtual private networks
   (VPNs), two interface models are defined.  One is the pipe model, and
   the other is the hose model [Duf1999].  Compared with pipe model,
   hose model provides important advantages to a VPN.  It is easy to
   specify QoS requests from customer since only one inward and outward
   rate per hose endpoint needs to be specified.  It also provides
   flexibility by allowing packets to and from a given hose endpoint to
   be distributed arbitrarily over other endpoints.  Statistical
   multiplexing gains can also be achieved on hose rate aggregation.
   And the requirements are easier to be characterized because the
   statistical variability of each pipe is smoothed by aggregating into
   hoses.

   Section 3 of [Duf1999] describes a Dynamically Resized VPNs, in which
   online measurements are used to determine the capacity requirements
   of hoses and then the amount of resources are reserved dynamically
   adapting to such measurements.  To accommodate the above
   requirements, methods for traffic measuring and signaling protocols
   for dynamically reserving resources are required.  [Duf1999] only
   gave the method for prediction of traffic rates, and no signaling
   protocol was mentioned.  The new features described in this document
   are focusing on signaling protocol scenario for dynamically resized
   VPNs.

   RSVP-TE is a protocol used to establish label-switched paths (LSPs)
   with traffic engineering in MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching).
   The capability of RSVP-TE on supporting explicit routing facilitates
   constructing a dynamically resizable VPN.  The optimal VPN tunnels
   can be renewed just through simply changing the explicit route
   object.

   The signaling protocol discussed in this document is used to achieve
   the dynamically resizable VPN, including the resizable hose interface
   at customer side and the changeable explicit routing.  To complete
   these function, some additional objects and a new message are
   proposed in the document.  And some related RSVP-TE objects are also
   redefined.

   The purpose of this document is to describe extensions of RSVP-TE to
   realize dynamically resizable VPN.  All the associated objects,
   package format, and signaling procedures for interoperation between
   customer edge (CE) and provider edge (PE), are described in detail.

   All objects and messages described in this document are optional,
   i.e., RSVP-TE can still work on its basic functions without these
   objects and messages.

   All the CEs and PEs participate in a multicast group via IGMP
   [RFC2236], and all the messages are transmitted and received by group
   package.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119] This
   document uses terminologies defined in RFC2205 [RFC2205],RFC3209
   [RFC3209],RFC2236 [RFC2236] The reader is assumed to be familiar with
   the terminology in RFC3209 [RFC3209]


3.  Overview

   This document defines extensions to RSVP-TE protocol as signaling to
   establish a user-controlled dynamic hose-based VPN.  This document
   relies on the semantics of RSVP-TE for building hose LSPs and
   explicit routing.

   This document describes a new message which contains four new
   objects.  The new message, termed as Hose-Notify message, has several
   functions including VPN connection request, Notification of hose
   model resizing, and notification of network information changed.

   To perform the signaling procedure of dynamic hose-based VPN, some of
   the RSVP-TE message objects, such as sender template object, filter
   specification object, explicit routing object, and extension of Error
   Code, are revised.

   In this document, Custom Edges (CEs) resize the hose interface via
   prediction on local traffic, and Provider Edges (PEs) renew the
   optimal routing by calculating the explicit routing.  Nevertheless,
   explicit routing calculation aspects for optimal routing and local
   traffic prediction are outside of scope of this document.

   Specifically, the extensions described in this draft include the
   message formats and the signaling flow chart.  The constructions for
   hose LSPs and resource reservation are completed by original RSVP-TE.

4.1.  Introduction of Hose-Notify message

   Hose-Notify message is a new message as an additional component of
   RSVP-TE for hose-based VPN.  The effect of Hose-Notify message is
   divided into two parts; one is used to complete the VPN connection
   request through hose interface, the other is used to send
   notification message whether hose interface size is changed or
   network information is changed.

   The format of Hose-Notify message is as follows:

   Hose-Notify message Type =TBD

            <Hose-Notify Message> ::=<Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ]
                                     <TIME VALUES>
                                     <VPN_Request>|<VPN_Response>|
                                     <Hose_Resizing>|<Net_Inf_Notify>
                                     [ <PROTECTION> ]
                                     [ <ADMIN STATUS> ]
                                     [ <POLICY DATA> ]

            <VPN_Response>::=<VPN_ACK>|<VPN_NACK>|<Rerouting_ACK>

   Among the objects of Hose-Notify message, the VPN_Request object,the
   VPN_Response object, the Hose_Resizing object and the Net_Inf_Notify
   object are additional objects for extension of RSVP-TE.The details of
   the four new objects are described in the following sections one by
   one.

4.2.  VPN_Request Object

   The VPN_Request object has the following format:

   CE Num:
       An 8-bit value used to indicate the number of customer edges in
       VPN after the dynamic rerouting.

   Reserved:
       An 8-bit length reserved for extensions of VPN ID or CE Num.

4.4.  Hose_Resizing Object

   Hose_Resizing object is used to resize the size of hose interface.
   CE would send Hose_Resizing object to its peer-to-peer CEs when the
   size of its hose interface has changed.  Functionally, this
   Hose_Resizing object contains two aspects; Hose_Resizing object is
   used to notify the update of the local hose interface to its peer-to-
   peer CEs, which named as Active-notify function; and the CE which
   received a Hose_Resizing object send a Hose_Resizing object back for
   acknowledgement and to notify its own hose interface update, which
   named as Inactive-notify.

   The Hose_Resizing object has the following format:

   Class=TBD C-Type=TBD


      0                 1                   2                   3

   Type:
       The Type field indicates the type of the function.  Currently
       defined values are:

       *   0x01 Active-notify function
       *   0x02 Inactive-notify function

   This Type field is used to avoid hose update oscillation.  The CE
   received the Hose-Notify object with type 1 would send the
   Hose_Notify object back, if the Type of Hose_Notify message is 2, CE
   just receives it.

   Length:
       The Length field contains the total length of the Hose_Resizing
       message object in bytes.  The Length must be at least 4, and must
       be a multiple of 4.

   Hose ID:
       A unique 8-bit identifier used to identify local hose interface,
       assigned by the management plane.

   VPN ID:
       A unique 8-bit identifier used to indicate the VPN which the
       Hose_Resizing object used for.

   Ingress Hose size:
       The 16-bit field is used to indicate the updated size of the
       ingress hose interface.

   Egress Hose size:
       The 16-bit field is used to indicate the updated size of the
       egress hose interface.

4.5.  Net_Inf_Notify Object

   This object is used to notify the update contents of Network
   information.  Provider edge (PE) sends Net_Inf_Notify object to its
   Customer edges (CEs) when the network information has changed.  It
   contains the VPN ID, a series of destination Hose ID and Network
   Resource Information.

   The Net_Inf_Notify Object has the following format:

   Length:
       The Length field contains the total length of the Net_Inf_Notify
       object in bytes.  The Length must be at least 4, and must be a
       multiple of 4.

   Des Hose ID:
       To be used as the identifiers of the destination hose interfaces.
       A provider edge (PE) could be connected with several CEs; the
       Net_Inf_Notify object may contain a series of 8-bit Des Hose ID
       field.

   VPN ID:
       A unique 8-bit identifier used to indicate the VPN which the
       Net_Inf_Notify object used for.

   Network Resource Information:
       A 4-byte field used to indicate the update contents of network
       information.  It could be used to resize the local hose interface
       by CEs.  Currently, the information contained is Maximum Network
       Bandwidth information and Minimum Network Delay information,
       which are indicated in the figure below.

   Padding:
       Zero on transmission.  Ignored on receipt.  This field is used to
       make sure the length of the object is a multiple of 4-byte.

4.6.  Hose state block (HSB)

   Hose state block (HSB) is used for Hose information storage.  In the
   VPN, each CE and its adjacent PE maintain HSBs for the Hose_Notify
   message.  The Hose_Notify message would store "Hose state" to HSB in
   CE node and PE node for each hose interface.  Each HSB holds hose
   state for a series of <IP Address, Hose ID, VPN ID, Ingress Hose
   size, Egress Hose size> structures as illustrated in Figure 1.  HSB
   could be used for hose resizing and explicit route calculations.

4.7.  Network state block (NSB)

   Network state block (NSB) is used to maintain Network information.
   Each PE which is adjacent to VPN node maintains a Network state block
   (NSB) for the Net_Inf_Notify object.  Each NSB holds a network
   information state for a particular <Maximum network bandwidth,
   Minimum network delay> pair.  Currently, NSB maintains the following
   values obtained from a Net_Inf_Notify object:

   o  Maximum network bandwidth
   o  Minimum network delay

   NSB could be used for hose resizing and explicit route calculations.


5.  Signaling Procedures

5.1.  VPN Connection Establishment

   Figure2 indicates the signaling procedure of VPN Connection
   Establishment.  All of the CEs to be a VPN participate in a same
   multicast group with IGMP protocol [RFC2236].  The message for
   signaling transmission would be send through multicast packet.  To
   create a VPN connection, a CE node, named as source CE, sends a
   VPN_Request message object to its destination CEs.  The destination
   CEs send VPN_ACK message object to indicate the acknowledgment for
   the request.  If destination CE rejects the VPN request, VPN_NACK
   would be send.

   Path message would be send by the source CE until VPN_ACK is
   received.  However, the Path message transmission is opaque; the
   explicit route calculation would be done at source Provider Edge
   (PE).  The algorithm for explicit route calculation is not discussed
   in this document.  The source PE forwards the Path message with
   explicit route object.  As well as RSVP-TE protocol, the LSPs would
   be constructed between the source CE and destination CEs by Path and
   Resv message.  And the resources would be reserved on each LSP.
   After the VPN connection is successful, CEs in this VPN could
   communicate with these LSPs.

5.2.  Hose Resizing and Routing update procedure

   The Hose Resizing and Routing update procedure is illustrated in
   Figure 3.  As mentioned in [Duf1999], CE could resize the local hose
   size through prediction for local traffic.  The method of prediction
   and resizing are not mentioned in this document.

   A source CE sends a Hose_Notify message to other destination CEs in
   the VPN when the local hose size has changed.  The Hose_Notify
   message shall include a Hose_Resizing object with the Type=1, which
   indicates the Hose ID and the updated hose size.  The hose resizing
   is a bi-directional procedure, destination CEs that received the
   Hose_Resizing object would resize its local hose interface and send a
   Hose_Notify message with a Type2 Hose_Resizing object back.

   The destination of the Tpye2 Hose_Resizing object is the source PE.
   Source PE re-calculates the explicit routing according to information
   from Hose_Resizing object.  The new Path message with the explicit
   route object would be sent by source PE according to the new explicit

   route.  After the successful interaction for the Path and the Resv
   message, the new LSPs with reserved resources would be constructed
   successfully.

   The source PE would send a Hose_Notify message contained
   Rerouting_ACK object to its adjacent source CE, this is used to
   notify the source CE that the new LSPs has been established
   successfully.

            Figure.3 Hose Resizing and Routing update procedure

5.3.  Notification of Network Information

   PE sends the Hose_Notify message with the Net_Inf_Notify object to
   its adjacent CE when PE finds the update of network.  As mentioned
   before, the contents of Net_Inf_Notify object contain maximum network
   bandwidth and minimum network delay.  The width and delay information
   would used to update the Network state block, and CE would resize its
   local hose interface to adapt to the new network information.

   CE sends Hose_Resizing object to notify its adjacent PE the hose
   interface update.  The explicit route procedure is done in PE, and
   then the Path message is send with the explicit route object.  The
   Path message and the Resv message are used to reserve resources and
   renew LSPs according to the new explicit route.  If this process is

               Figure.4 Notification of Network Information

5.4.  Resv message Failure for insufficient network resources

   If the Resv message is failure because of insufficient network
   resources, the provider site where the error happened would send a
   Resv Err message to both the source CE and the destination PE.  The
   Resv Err message includes an insufficient network resources error.

   The source CE resizes its local hose interface for the insufficient
   network resources.  The resized hose size would be sent through the
   Hose_Resizing object to its adjacent PE.  PE site re-calculates the
   explicit route and sends Path message with explicit route object to
   destination PE.  The destination PE sends Resv message upstream
   towards the source CE for resource reservation.  The new LSPs have
   been established by the Path and Resv message, and the new generated
   data stream would be transmitted through these new LSPs.  Figure 5
   illustrate s the signaling procedure of Resv message failure for
   insufficient network resources.

       lack of Network resources, such as bandwidth or optical
       wavelength.

   Error Code=TBD: Unknown Hose ID
       Reservation or Path message has been rejected for the incorrect
       Hose ID.For example, the Hose ID included in Path message or Resv
       message may not correspond to the ID held in the HSB.

       This Error Code may appear in a PathErr or ResvErr message.

   Error Code=TBD: Unknown VPN ID
       Reservation or Path message has been rejected for the incorrect
