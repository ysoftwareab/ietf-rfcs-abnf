Abstract

   Domains can authenticate their outgoing mail using DKIM or other
   techniques.  In some cases where miscreants frequently use a domain
   without authorization in the Author address in e-mail messages, it
   may be prudent for recipient mail systems to discard unauthenticated
   mail as likely to be fraudulent.  This specification defines an
   extension to Vouch by Reference (VBR) that allows a certifier to
   identify such domains, and that recipients can use either in
   conjunction with or independently of VBR.

1.  Introduction

   Vouch by Reference [RFC5518] allows a third party certifier to
   certify the owner of a domain name that is associated with received
   mail.  In typical usage, a recipient uses VBR to identify mail from
   known reliable senders so it can can bypass spam filters.

   A few domains, such as those of banks and online greeting cards, are
   frequently used without authorization in unwanted "phish" messages,
   intended to trick recipients into revealing personal information, to
   render messages that include malware installers, or other undesirable
   actions.  If a domain can authenticate all of its outgoing mail using
   DKIM [RFC4871] or other means, any unsigned message is likely to be
   unauthorized, give or take the possibility that a legitimate message
   could fail authentication due to the known shortcomings of
   authentication systems.  For a limited number of domains, if the
   domain is indeed frequently used without authorization, the domain
   does authenticate all its mail, its mail is likely to be received in
   ways that don't make authentication fail, and the cost of losing a
   legitimate message is relatively low, the overall harm to recipients
   could be minimized by discarding unauthenticated messages.

   Since they are already evaluating the domains' practices, third party
   certifiers are well positioned to evaluate the suitability of domains
   for a policy of discarding unauthenticated messages.  This document
   specifies a method for publishing discard advice as an extension to
   VBR.

   Requirements Notation:   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
      "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
      "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
      interpreted as described in [RFC2119]


2.  Author Domain Identity and Authentication

   Although an e-mail message potentially is associated with a variety
   of domains, this specification imports the term Author Domain from
   Section 2 of ADSP [RFC5617].  The identity on which the discard
   advice is based is the Author Domain.

   Section 7 of VBR [RFC5518] specifies the methods that a recipient can
   use to obtain an accountable domain for a message, for use with VBR.
   If a message has an accountable domain that is the same as the Author
   Domain, the message is Author Authenticated.  If there is no such
   accountable domain, the message is not Author Authenticated.

3.  Publication of Discard Advice

   Section 5 of VBR [RFC5518] specifies the DNS query to look up the
   certification status of a domain.  This specification extends the
   semantics of that query to include a check for discard advice.  If,
   for example, a message had an Author Domain of somebank.example, and
   a certifier's domain were certifier-a.example, the recipient would
   make a DNS query for a TXT record at:

   somebank.example._vouch.certifier-a.example

   (Note that the Author Domain may or may not be the same domain as a
   VBR accountable domain for the message.)

   Section 6 of VBR [RFC5518] specifies the types of message content
   that a certifier can vouch for, as a space-separated list of lower
   case text strings placed in the TXT record.  The discard advice is
   also placed in the same text record as lower case strings.  The
   strings for types of message content are disjoint from those for
   discard advice, and VBR clients MUST ignore unknown strings, so the
   contents of the TXT records remain unambiguous, and usable by pure
   VBR clients.

3.1.  Terms for discard advice

   This specification defines the following string for discard advice.

   discardable -  Discard the message if it is not Author Authenticated.


4.  Checking for Discard Advice

   A receiver performs the following steps:

   1.  Extract the Author Domain from the message.

   2.  Check to see whether the message is Author Authenticated.  If it
       is, stop.  The advice for Author Authenticated messages is always
       not to discard them.

   3.  It the message is not Author Authenticated, fetch the VBR record
       for the Author Domain for the desired certifier, as described in
       Section 3.  If the DNS lookup fails (NXDOMAIN or NODATA status in
       the DNS response), stop.  The certifier offers no discard advice
       for the domain.

   4.  Check the TXT record for the terms in Section 3.1.  If the record
       includes "discardable", the advice is to discard the message.

5.  Certifier Considerations

5.1.  What Domains are Appropriate for Discard Advice

   A certifier should only publish advice to discard a domain's mail
   after careful analysis, since doing so increases the risk that a
   valid message will not be delivered to a recipient that desired to
   receive it.

   Is all of the domain's mail sent directly from the domain's own
   servers?  If mail can legitmately be sent any other way, it is likely
   that there will be legitimate mail that is not authenticated.  Common
   situations where mail is sent from other servers include roaming
   users sending through hotel networks, users who consolidate multiple
   mailboxes using a Web mail system, and mail sent through mailing
   lists.

   Does the domain have individual users composing messages by hand, or
   is all of the mail generated by software?  Experience suggests that
   individual users are far more likely to send legitmate mail that is
   not authenticated.

   Is all of the domain's mail transactional notifications?  For some
   domains, all mail reports the status of an account or transaction,
   such as "we shipped your order" or "your bank statement is
   available."  These messages typically direct the recipient to look at
   a Web site with complete information about the transaction or
   account.  The risk from discarding mail from these domains is
   relatively limited.  Since the intended recipient can always recover
   the information in a lost message by visiting the Web site, no
   information is lost, just delayed, if a message is not received.

   Is the domain a significant phishing target?  Some domains appear in
   e-mail without authorization far more often than others.  If a domain
   rarely appears in e-mail without authorization in the first place, it
   is relatively unlikely that an unsigned message is fraudulent rather
   than being a legitimate message.  In that case it would be unwise to
   discard unsigned messages, since those messages are likely to be
   legitimate.  On the other hand, if a domain is used without
   authorization in large numbers of messages, it is much more likely
   that an unsigned message is fraudulent.

5.2.  Selection of Authentication Methods

   A certifier SHOULD document the authentication method or methods that
   it expects to be used by the domains for which it publishes discard
   advice.  Recipients SHOULD interpret discard advice relative to those
   methods.  If a certifer documents more than one method, such as DK

   and DKIM, Author Authenticated mail can be authenticated by any of
   those methods.  (This could be the case if a domain were migrating
   from DomainKeys to DKIM, and signs some of its mail with one and some
   with the other.

5.3.  Certification and Discard Advice for the Same Domain

   A certifier may wish to certify a domain's mail, and also publish
   discard advice for that domain.  A likely example would be a
   financial organization that sends authenticated transactional mail,
   and is also a major phishing target.  In that case, the certifier
   vouches for the domain's authenticated mail, and advises recipients
   to discard unauthenticated mail.  The certifier's VBR record for that
   domain would contain:

   transaction discardable

   Note the recipients can use only the certification, only the discard
   advice, or both.


6.  Receiver Considerations

   The steps for checking discard advice and for checking VBR
   certification are different, even though a receiver may do both for
   the same message, and fetch the same VBR record from the DNS for
   both.  Most notably, while receivers only do VBR checks for messages
   that contain a VBR-Info header field, they need to make discard
   advice checks for any message that is not Author Authenticated, since
   it is unlikely that miscreants will add VBR-Info header fields.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests to IANA.


8.  Security Considerations

   Discarding any incoming mail introduces a risk of losing legitimate
   messages.  A mail system that uses discard advice should carefully
   weigh the relative risk of lost messages against that of delivering
   mail containing phishes or malware.

   VBR and discard advice by their design delegate part of a mail
   system's management to a third party, with the risk of mishandling
   mail if the third party is incompetent or malicious.  Before making
   such a delegation, a system's management SHOULD satisify itself that

   the third party's advice is of acceptable quality.
