Abstract

   This document changes the IANA registry policy for a number of D/TLS-
   related registries, renames some of the registries for consistency,
   and adds notes to many of the registries.  As a result, this document
   updates many RFCs (see updates header).

1.  Process Note

   As the authors of this draft are also the WG chairs, the responsible
   Area Director has agreed to judge consensus.

   RFC EDITOR: Please delete section prior to publication.

2.  Introduction

   This document requests that IANA make changes to a number of TLS-
   related IANA registries:

   o  Add "TLS" to registries' names for consistency with other TLS-
      related registries.

   o  Change the IANA registry policy [RFC5226] for the TLS
      ExtensionType Values, TLS Cipher Suite, and TLS
      ClientCertificateType Identifiers registries.  These more relaxes
      rules are more condusive to TBD.

   o  Add the designated expert intructions as a note to the TLS
      ExtensionType Values, TLS Cipher Suite, and TLS
      ClientCertificateType Identifiers registries to inform IANA-

Internet-Draft         D/TLS IANA Registry Updates        September 2016


      registry-focused, non-RFC-reading what's expected from the
      registry.

   o  Add notes to indicate whether an extension, certain values of an
      extension, or an entire registry is only applicable pre-D/TLS 1.3.

   o  Rename the NewSessionTicket TLS HandshakeType message registry
      entry [RFC5077] to new_session_ticket to match the naming
      nomenclature for the other Handshake type names and to match with
      existing implementations.

   o  Rename the SessionTicket TLS to session_ticket to match the
      nomenclature for the other extensions' names.

   o  Add missing entry to the TLS Alert Registry for the
      no_application_protocol alert defined in [RFC7301]

   This document proposes no changes to the TLS Alert
   [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13], TLS ContentType [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13], TLS
   HandshakeType, [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] and TLS Certificate Status Types
   [RFC6961]; Standards Action, for the 1st three, and IETF Review, for
   the last, are appropriate for these one-byte code points because of
   their scarcity.

   This document proposes no changes to the EC Curve Type, EC Point
   Format registries , and Supported Groups Registry (see
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4492bis]).

   The lengthy updates header is a result of requests for IANA to refer
   to this draft in addition to the original RFC that defined a
   particular registry.

3.  Add "TLS" to Registry Names

   IANA is to update the names of the following registries to add "TLS"
   to for consistency with the other TLS-related extensions:

   o  Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs,

   o  ExtensionType Values,

   o  Heartbeat Message Types,

   o  Heartbeat Modes, and

   o  Supported Groups.

Internet-Draft         D/TLS IANA Registry Updates        September 2016


   IANA is also to add a reference to this document for the registry
   whose names have been updated as a result of the above change.

   NOTE: Henceforth in this document the registries will be referred to
   using the "TLS" prefix.

4.  Aligning with RFC 5226

   Many of the TLS-related IANA registries were defined prior to
   [RFC5226] where "IETF Consensus" was used instead of the
   RFC5226-defined "IETF Review".  To align with the new terminology,
   IANA is to update to use "IETF Review" in place of "IETF Consensus"
   in the following registries:

   o  TLS Authorization Data Formats

   o  TLS Supplemental Data Formats (SupplementalDataType)

   NOTE: Not that this is not a universal change as some registries
   originally defined with "IETF Consensus" are undergoing other changes
   either as a result of this document or [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4492bis].

5.  TLS ExtensionType Values

   IANA is to update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows:

   o  Change the registry policy to:

      Values with the first byte in the range 0-254 (decimal) are
      assigned via Specification Required [RFC5226].  Values with the
      first byte 255 (decimal) are reserved for Private Use [RFC5226].

   o  Update the "References" to also refer to this document.

   o  Add the following note:

      Note: Experts are to verify that there is in fact a publicly
      available standard.

6.  TLS Cipher Suite Registry

   IANA is to update the TLS Cipher Suite registry as follows:

   o  Change the registry policy to:

      Values with the first byte in the range 0-254 (decimal) are
      assigned via Specification Required [RFC5226].  Values with the
      first byte 255 (decimal) are reserved for Private Use [RFC2434].

Internet-Draft         D/TLS IANA Registry Updates        September 2016


   o  Add a "Recommended" column to the cipher suite registry.  All
      ciphers listed in [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] Appendix A.4 are marked as
      "Yes".  All other cipher suites are marked as "No".

   o  Add the following:

      Note:

      Cipher suites marked as "Yes" are those allocated via Standards
      Track RFCs.  Cipher suites marked as "No" are not; cipher suites
      marked "No" range from "good" to "bad" from a cryptographic
      standpoint.

      The designated expert [RFC5226] only ensures that the
      specification is publically available.

7.  TLS ClientCertificateType Identifiers

   IANA is to update the TLS ClientCertificateType Identifiers registry
   as follows:

   o  Change the registry policy to:

      Values in the range 0-223 are assigned via Specification Required
      [RFC5226].  Values 224-255 are are reserved for Private Use.

   o  Add the following:

      Note:

      The designated expert [RFC5226] only ensures that the
      specification is publically available.

8.  New Session Ticket TLS Handshake Message Type

   To align with TLS implementations and to align the naming
   nomenclature for other Handshake message types, IANA is to rename
   entry 4 in the TLS HandshakeType registry to "new_session_ticket
   (renamed from NewSessionTicket)".  IANA is to also add a reference to
   this document in the Reference column for entry 4 in the TLS
   HandshakeType registry.

9.  Session Ticket TLS Extension

   The nomenclature for the registry entries in the TLS ExtensionType
   Values registry correspond to the presentation language field name
   except for entry 35.  To ensure that the values in the registry are

Internet-Draft         D/TLS IANA Registry Updates        September 2016


   consistently identified in the registry, IANA is to rename entry 35
   to "session_ticket (renamed from "SessionTicket TLS")".

10.  TLS Exporter Label Registry

   IANA is to add the following note to the TLS Exporter Label Registry:

 {{RFC5705}} defines keying material exporters for TLS in terms of the TLS PRF. {{I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}} replaced the PRF with HKDF, thus requiring a new construction. The exporter interface remains the same, however the value is computed different.

11.  Add Missing Item to TLS Alert Registry

   IANA is to add the following entry to the TLS Alert Registry (the
   entry was omitted from the IANA instructions in [RFC7301]):

   120   no_application_protocol  Y  [RFC7301]

12.  Orphaned Extensions

   To make it clear that D/TLS 1.3 has orphaned certain extensions
   (i.e., they are only applicable to version of D/TLS prior to 1.3),
   IANA is to add the following to the TLS ExtensionType Values
   registry:

Note:

The following extensions are only applicable to D/TLS protocol vesions prior to 1.3: truncated_hmac, srp, encrypt_then_mac, extended_master_secret, session_ticket, and renegotiation_info are not applicable to TLS 1.3.

13.  Orphaned Registries

   To make it clear that D/TLS 1.3 has orphaned certain registries
   (i.e., they are only applicable to version of D/TLS protocol versions
   prior to 1.3), IANA is to:

   o  Add the following to the TLS Compression Method Identifiers
      registry [RFC3749]:

      Note:

      Value 0 (NULL) is the only value in this registry applicable to D/
      TLS protocol versions prior to 1.3.

   o  Add the following to the TLS Hash Algorithm [RFC5246] and TLS
      SignatureAlgorithm registries [RFC5246]:

      Note:

      The values in this registry are only applicable to D/TLS protocol
      versions prior to 1.3.

   o  Update the "References" in the TLS Compression Method Identifiers,
      TLS Hash Algorithm [RFC5246] and TLS SignatureAlgorithm registries
      to also refer to this document.
