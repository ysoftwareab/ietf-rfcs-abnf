Internet-Draft           YAM 5322bis Evaluation                 May 2010


1.  Introduction

   A preliminary evaluation has been made of "Internet Message Format"
   [RFC5322] by the Yet Another Mail (YAM) Working Group for advancing
   it from Draft to Full Standard.  The YAM WG requests feedback from
   the IESG on this decision.

1.1.  Note to RFC Editor

   This Internet-Draft is not meant to be published as an RFC.  It is
   written to facilitate processing within the IESG.

2.  Preliminary Evaluation

2.1.  Document

   Title:   Internet Message Format

   Link:   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322

2.2.  Time in Place

   RFC2026:   _"A specification shall remain at the Draft Standard level
      for at least four (4) months, or until at least one IETF meeting
      has occurred."_

   Published:   October 2008

2.3.  Implementation and Operational Experience

   RFC2026:   _"significant implementation and successful operational
      experience ... characterized by a high degree of technical
      maturity and by a generally held belief that the specified
      protocol or service provides significant benefit to the Internet
      community."_

   Confidence level:  Very high.

   [RFC5322] moved [RFC2822] from Proposed to Draft Standard, which
   itself was an update of [RFC0822] done by the DRUMS WG.  Both
   [RFC5322] and [RFC2822] brought the protocol specifications into line
   with actual implementations and operational experience in electronic
   mail over the past 28 years.  In that sense, the implementation and
   operational experience with these documents has been extensive.

2.4.  Proposed Changes

   The YAM WG proposes making the following changes in a revision:

   Errata 1766:  A simple clarifying editorial change, will be fixed.

   Errata 1906:  A request to simplify the ABNF of the obsolete (i.e.,
      backward compatability) syntax of the body of a message, will be
      examined to see if the syntax can be simplified, though the
      suggested syntax provided by the errata reporter is not correct as
      stated.

   Errata 1908:  An error in the ABNF of the obsolete (i.e., backward
      compatability) syntax of "folding white space" that does not agree
      with the description in the document or the current practice, will
      be fixed.

   Errata 2104:  An error in the ABNF of the obsolete (i.e., backward
      compatability) syntax of "unstructured" text that does not agree
      with the description in the document or the current practice, will
      be fixed.

2.5.  Non-Changes

   The YAM WG discussed and chose not to make the following changes:

   1.  The Security Considerations section was extensively reviewed in
       2008 (during the review and approval of RFC 5322).  No evidence
       has appeared since then that would require further review or
       additional changes.

2.6.  Downward references

   At Full Standard, the following references would be downward
   references:

      None.

2.7.  IESG Feedback

   The YAM WG requests feedback from the IESG on this decision.  In
   particular:

   o  Does the IESG believe the proposed changes are suitable during a
      move from Draft to Full Standard?

   o  Excluding the previous proposed changes and expected IESG support
      for technically substantive IETF last call feedback, does the IESG

Internet-Draft           YAM 5322bis Evaluation                 May 2010


      believe any additional changes are critical to advance this
      document from draft to full standard?  If so, please provide
      sufficient information so the WG can address these issues prior to
      IETF last call or determine that the document is inappropriate for
      the YAM WG to process at this time.

   o  Does the IESG consider the downward references acceptable for a
      full standard?  If not, please cite which specific downward
      reference or references are problematic and why so the WG can
      address these issues prior to IETF last call or determine the
      document is inappropriate for the YAM WG to process at this time.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains no IANA actions.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document requests IESG feedback and does not raise any security
   concerns.  Security considerations forRFC 5322 [RFC5322] have been
   taken into account during the preliminary evaluation and appear in
   either Section 2.4 or Section 2.5 of this document.
