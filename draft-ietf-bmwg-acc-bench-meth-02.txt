   ABSTRACT
   Routers in an operational network are simultaneously configured with 
   multiple protocols and security policies while forwarding traffic and 
   being managed.  To accurately benchmark a router for deployment it is 
   necessary that the router be tested in these simultaneous 
   operational conditions, which is known as Stress Testing.  This 
   document provides the Methodology for performing Stress Benchmarking 
   of networking devices.  Descriptions of Test Topology, Benchmarks and 
   Reporting Format are provided in addition to procedures for 
   conducting various test cases.  The methodology is to be used with 
   the companion terminology document [4].

   1. Introduction
   Router testing benchmarks have consistently been made in a 
   monolithic fashion wherein a single protocol or behavior is 
   measured in an isolated environment.  It is important to know the 
   limits for a networking device's behavior for each protocol in isolation, 
   however this does not produce a reliable benchmark of the device's 
   behavior in an operational network.

   Routers in an operational network are simultaneously configured with 
   multiple protocols and security policies while forwarding traffic 
   and being managed.  To accurately benchmark a router for deployment 
   it is necessary to test that router in operational conditions by 
   simultaneously configuring and scaling network protocols and security 
   policies, forwarding traffic, and managing the device.  It is helpful 
   to accelerate these network operational conditions with Instability 
   Conditions [4] so that the networking devices are stress tested. 

   This document provides the Methodology for performing Stress 
   Benchmarking of networking devices.  Descriptions of Test Topology, 
   Benchmarks and Reporting Format are provided in addition to 
   procedures for conducting various test cases.  The methodology is 
   to be used with the companion terminology document [4].

INTERNET-DRAFT Methodology for Accelerated Stress Benchmarking  February 2005


   Stress Testing of networking devices provides the following benefits:
   	1. Evaluation of multiple protocols enabled simultaneously as 
      	configured in deployed networks
   	2. Evaluation of System and Software Stability
   	3. Evaluation of Manageability under stressful conditions
	4. Identification of Buffer Overflow conditions	
   	5. Identification of Software Coding bugs such as:
		a. Memory Leaks
		b. Suboptimal CPU Utilization
		c. Coding Logic	

   These benefits produce significant advantages for network operations:
	1.  Increased stability of routers and protocols
	2.  Hardened routers to DoS attacks
	3.  Verified manageability under stress
	4.  Planning router resources for growth and scale 

   2.  Existing definitions
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [Br97].  RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make the
   intent of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this
   document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards track
   document.

   Terms related to Accelerated Stress Benchmarking are defined in [4].

   3. Test Setup
   3.1 Test Topologies
   Figure 1 shows the physical configuration to be used for the 
   methodologies provided in this document.  The number of interfaces 
   between the tester and DUT will scale depending upon the number of 
   control protocol sessions and traffic forwarding interfaces.  A 
   separate device may be required to externally manage the device in 
   the case that the test equipment does not support such  
   functionality.  Figure 2 shows the logical configuration for the 
   stress test methodologies.  Each plane may be emulated by single or 
   multiple test equipment.

   3.2 Test Considerations
   The Accelerated Stress Benchmarking test can be applied in 
   service provider test environments to benchmark DUTs under 
   stress in an environment that is reflective of an operational 
   network.  A particular Configuration Set is defined and the 
   DUT is benchmarked using this configuration set and the 
   Instability Conditions.  Varying Configuration Sets and/or 
   Instability Conditions applied in an iterative fashion can 
   provide an accurate characterization of the DUT 
   to help determine future network deployments.

INTERNET-DRAFT Methodology for Accelerated Stress Benchmarking  February 2005

   It is RECOMMENDED that Aggregate Forwarding Rates, Latencies, and
   Session Losses be measured at one-second intervals.  These same 
   benchmarks can also be used as Variability Benchmarks reported as 
   the differences between the Benchmarks for multiple iterations 
   with the same DUT.  For the purpose of the Variability Benchmarks, 
   A more complete characterization of the DUT would be to apply 
   multiple test iterations for the same Configuration Sets and 
   Instability Conditions, measure the Variability Benchmarks, and 
   then vary the Configuration Set and/or Instability Conditions. 



   4. Test Cases

   4.1 Failed Primary EBGP Peer 

	Objective 
	The purpose of this test is to benchmark the performance
	of the DUT during stress conditions when losing an EBGP 
	Peer from which most FIB routes have been learned.

	Procedure
	1. Report Configuration Set
	2. Begin Startup Conditions with the DUT
	3. Establish Configuration Sets with the DUT
	4. Report benchmarks (for stability)
	5. Apply Instability Conditions
        6. Remove link to EBGP peer with most FIB routes.  This SHOULD 
           be achieved by losing physical layer connectivity with 
           a local fiber pull.  Loss of the peering session SHOULD
           cause the DUT to withdraw 100,000 or greater routes.
	7. Report benchmarks (for instability)
	8. Stop applying all Instability Conditions
	9. Report benchmarks (for recovery)
	10. Optional - Change Configuration Set and/or Instability 
	   Conditions for next iteration

	Results
	It is expected that there will be significant packet loss
	until the DUT converges from the lost EBGP link.  Other DUT
	operation should be stable without session loss or sustained 
	packet loss.  Recovery time should not be infinite.

INTERNET-DRAFT Methodology for Accelerated Stress Benchmarking  February 2005

   4.2 Establish New EBGP Peer 

	Objective 
        The purpose of this test is to benchmark the performance
        of the DUT during stress conditions when establishing a 
        new EBGP Peer from which routes are learned.

	Procedure
	1. Report Configuration Set
	2. Begin Startup Conditions with the DUT
	3. Establish Configuration Sets with the DUT
	4. Report benchmarks (for stability)
	5. Apply Instability Conditions
        6. Configure a new EBGP peering session at DUT and peering router.
           Physical and Data Link Layer connectivity SHOULD already exist
           to perform this step.  Establishment of the peering session
	   MUST result in the DUT learning 100,000 or greater routes from
           the BGP peer and advertising 100,000 or greater routes to
           the BGP peer
	7. Report benchmarks (for instability)
	8. Stop applying all Instability Conditions
	9. Report benchmarks (for recovery)
	10. Optional - Change Configuration Set and/or Instability 
	   Conditions for next iteration

	Results
        It is expected that there will be zero packet loss as the DUT 
        learns the new routes.  Other DUT operation should be stable 
        without session loss or sustained packet loss.  

   4.3 BGP Route Explosion 

	Objective 
	The purpose of this test is to benchmark the performance
	of the DUT during stress conditions when there is BGP Route 
	Explosion experienced in the network.

	Procedure
        1. Report Configuration Set
        2. Begin Startup Conditions with the DUT
        3. Establish Configuration Sets with the DUT
        4. Report benchmarks (for stability)
        5. Apply Instability Conditions
        6. Advertise 1M BGP routes to the DUT from a single EBGP 
           neighbor. 
        7. Report benchmarks (for instability)
        8. Stop applying all Instability Conditions, including BGP route 
           advertisement.
        9. Report benchmarks (for recovery)
        10. Optional - Change Configuration Set and/or Instability 
	   Conditions for next iteration


Poretsky and Rao					        	[Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT Methodology for Accelerated Stress Benchmarking  February 2005

	Results
	It is expected that there will be no additional packet loss from
	the advertisement of routes from the BGP neighbor.  Other 
	DUT operation should be stable without session loss.  

   4.4 BGP Policy Configuration

        Objective 
        The purpose of this test is to benchmark the performance
        of the DUT during stress conditions when there is continuous
        reconfiguration of BGP Policy at the DUT.

        Procedure
        1. Report Configuration Set
        2. Begin Startup Conditions with the DUT
        3. Establish Configuration Sets with the DUT
        4. Report benchmarks (for stability)
        5. Apply Instability Conditions
        6. Configure BGP Policy on the DUT for each established neighbor.
           The BGP Policy SHOULD filter 25% of the routes learned from 
           that neighbor.  Note that the specific policy configuration 
           to achieve the filtering may be device specific.
        7. Every 30 minutes remove the BGP Policy configuration and then 
           configure it gain so that it is reapplied.
        8. Report benchmarks (for instability)
        9. Stop applying all Instability Conditions, including Policy 
           changes
        10. Report benchmarks (for recovery)
        11. Optional - Change Configuration Set and/or Instability 
	   Conditions for next iteration

	Results
        It is expected that there will be no packet loss resulting from 
        the continuous configuration and removal of BGP Policy for BGP 
        neighbors.  Other DUT operation should be stable without session 
        loss.

   4.5 Persistent BGP Flapping 

        Objective 
        The purpose of this test is to benchmark the performance
        of the DUT during stress conditions when flapping BGP Peering 
        sessions for an infinite period.

        Procedure
        1. Report Configuration Set
        2. Begin Startup Conditions with the DUT
        3. Establish Configuration Sets with the DUT
        4. Report benchmarks (for stability)

INTERNET-DRAFT Methodology for Accelerated Stress Benchmarking  February 2005


        6. Repeatedly flap an IBGP and an EBGP peering session.  
           This SHOULD be achieved by losing physical layer connectivity  
           via a local interface shutdown/no shutdown every 180 seconds with
           a delay of 10 seconds between the shut and no shut.  
           The loss of the EBGP peering session MUST cause the DUT to withdraw 
           100,000 or greater routes that are re-learned when the session 
           re-establishes.   Route Flap Dampening SHOULD NOT be enabled.
        7. Report benchmarks (for instability)
        8. Stop applying all Instability Conditions, including flapping
        9. Report benchmarks (for recovery)
        10. Optional - Change Configuration Set and/or Instability 
            Conditions for next iteration

        Results
        It is expected that there will be significant packet loss
        from repeated Convergence Events.  Other DUT operation should be 
        stable without session loss.  Recovery time should not be infinite.

     4.6 BGP Route Flap Dampening

        Objective 
        The purpose of this test is to benchmark the performance
        of the DUT during stress conditions when flapping BGP Peering 
        sessions for an infinite period and route flap dampening is 
        enabled.

        Procedure
        1. Report Configuration Set
	2. Configure Route Flap Dampening on the DUT with DEFAULT parameter 
           values.

           via a local interface shutdown/no shutdown every 180 seconds with
           a delay of 10 seconds between the shut and no shut.  
           The loss of the EBGP peering session MUST cause the DUT to withdraw 
           100,000 or greater routes that are re-learned when the session 
           re-establishes.   
        8. Report benchmarks (for instability)

        Results
        It is expected that there will be significant packet loss
        from repeated Convergence Events and flap dampening.  Other DUT operation 
        should be stable without session loss.  Recovery time should not be infinite.

     4.7 Nested Convergence Events [5]

        Objective

        3. Establish Configuration Sets with the DUT
        4. Report benchmarks (for stability)
        5. Restart DUT. This marks the beginning on the recovery period.
        6. Report benchmarks (for recovery) 
        7. Optional - Change Configuration Set and/or Instability 
           Conditions for next iteration
        NOTE 1: Restart via the DUT's  Command Line Interface rather than
                power cycle is typically more stressful than power cycle 
                since hardware can maintain state.  
        NOTE 2: Instability Conditions are not applied for this test case.

        Results
        DUT should re-establish all control protocol sessions and have 
        a Recovery Time [4] that is not infinite.  

     4.9 Destination Control Processor

        Objective 
        The purpose of this test is to benchmark the performance
        of the DUT during stress conditions when traffic is destined for 
        the Control Processor of the DUT.

        Procedure
        1. Report Configuration Set
        2. Begin Startup Conditions with the DUT
        3. Start Configuration Sets with the DUT, except Data Plane 
           Configuration Set
        4. Report benchmarks (for stability)
        5. Apply Instability Conditions
        6. Send offered load at maximum forwarding rate of DUT interfaces
           to all DUT interfaces.  Traffic MUST be configured so that the
           offered load has a destination address that is the DUT's central
           control processor
        7. Report benchmarks (for instability)
        8. Stop applying all Instability Conditions, including data traffic
        9. Report benchmarks (for recovery)
        10. Optional - Change Configuration Set and/or Instability 
            Conditions for next iteration

        Results
        Results will vary with specific vendor implementations.  
        It is possible that significant session loss is observed.

     4.10 Destination Control Processor with Rate-Limiting

        Objective 
        The purpose of this test is to benchmark the performance
        of the DUT during stress conditions when traffic is destined for 
        the Control processor of the DUT.

        Procedure
        1. Report Configuration Set
        2. Apply policy filter to rate-limit traffic arriving at the Central 
           Processor to be only 1% of the offered load.
        3. Begin Startup Conditions with the DUT
        4. Start Configuration Sets with the DUT, except Data Plane 
           Configuration Set
        5. Report benchmarks (for stability)
        6. Apply Instability Conditions
        7. Send offered load at maximum forwarding rate of DUT interfaces
           to all DUT interfaces.  Traffic MUST be configured so that the
           offered load has a destination address that is the DUT's central
           control processor
        8. Report benchmarks (for instability)
        9. Stop applying all Instability Conditions, including data traffic
        10. Report benchmarks (for recovery)
        11. Optional - Change Configuration Set and/or Instability 
            Conditions for next iteration

        Results
        Results will vary with specific vendor implementations.  There should be 
        no session loss observed.

     4.11 Destination Interfaces
        Objective 
        The purpose of this test is to benchmark the performance
        of the DUT during stress conditions when traffic is destined for 
        the interfaces of the DUT.

        Procedure
        1. Report Configuration Set
        2. Begin Startup Conditions with the DUT
        3. Start Configuration Sets with the DUT, except Data Plane 
           Configuration Set
        4. Report benchmarks (for stability)
        5. Apply Instability Conditions
        6. Send offered load at maximum forwarding rate of DUT interfaces
           to all DUT interfaces.  Traffic MUST be configured so that the
           offered load has destination addresses of the interfaces receiving 
           traffic.
        7. Report benchmarks (for instability)
        8. Stop applying all Instability Conditions, including data traffic
        9. Report benchmarks (for recovery)
        10. Optional - Change Configuration Set and/or Instability 
            Conditions for next iteration

     4.12 DoS Attack 

        Objective 
        The purpose of this test is to benchmark the performance of the 
        DUT during stress conditions while experiencing a DoS attack.

	Procedure
	1. Report Configuration Set
	2. Begin Startup Conditions with the DUT
	3. Establish Configuration Sets with the DUT
	4. Report benchmarks (for stability)
	5. Apply Instability Conditions
        6. Initiate DoS Attack against DUT.  It is RECOMMENDED that
           the SYN Flood attack be used for the DoS attack. 
	7. Report benchmarks (for instability)
	8. Stop applying all Instability Conditions
	9. Report benchmarks (for recovery)
	10. Optional - Change Configuration Set and/or Instability 
	   Conditions for next iteration

	DUT should be able to defend against DoS attack without additional 
	packet loss or session loss.  

   5. Security Considerations
        Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of
        the Internet or of corporate networks as long as benchmarking
        is not performed on devices or systems connected to operating
        networks.
