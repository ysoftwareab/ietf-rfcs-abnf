Abstract

   This document describes extensions to the OSPF version 3 to support
   Traffic Engineering [RFC2702].  The OSPFv3 protocol is specified in
   [RFC2740].

   This document extends OSPFv3 protocol by specifying new LS type for
   exchanging traffic engineering information.  This document defines
   new TLV to [OSPFV2-TE] to make it work with IPv6 network.  Besides
   the new TLV, other TLV is completely same as [OSPFV2-TE].


1. Applicability

   OSPFv3 has a very flexible mechanism for adding new LS type.  Even
   the implementation does not know the LS types, the LSA is properly
   flooded by LS type field.  This document add a new LSA type Traffic
   Engineering LSA to OSPFv3.

   For Traffic Engineering, this document use [OSPFV2-TE] as predefined
   TLV document.  Main purpose of this document is making [OSPFV2-TE]
   applicable to IPv6 network with minimum change.


2. Router Address TLV

   [OSPFV2-TE] defines Router Address TLV.  [OSPFV2-TE] said it is
   stable IP address of the advertising router and the address is always
   reachable.  For IPv6 network it is not real IP address neither it is
   not reachable.  The Router Address TLV is used to identify Router-
   LSA.  So in OSPFv3 it must be Router ID of the advertising router.
   It is much like Router ID TLV rather than Router Address TLV.  Router
   Address TLV can be used as it is using Router ID value for it.


3. Link TLV

   Almost Link TLV can be applied to OSPFv3.  Three sub-TLVs: Link ID,
   Local interface IP address and Remote interface IP address can't be
   used for OSPFv3.  To make it applicable three new sub-TLVs are
   defined.

     9  - Neighbor ID (8 octets)
     10 - Local Interface IPv6 Address (16N octets)
     11 - Remote Interface IPv6 Address (16N octets)


3.1 Neighbor ID

   In OSPFv2, Link ID is unique key to identify Network LSA.  In OSPFv3
   to identify Network LSA, the combination of Neighbor Interface ID and
   Neighbor Router ID is needed.  So new sub-TLV Neighbor ID is defined.

   The Neighbor ID sub-TLV is TLV type 9, and is 8 octets in length.  It
   contains 4 octet Neighbor Interface ID following 4 octet Neighbor
   Router ID.  Neighbor Interface ID and Neighbor Router ID value is
   same as described in [OSPFV3] A.4.3 Router-LSAs.


3.2 Local Interface IPv6 Address

   The Local Interface IPv6 Address sub-TLV specifies the IPv6

   address(es) of the interface corresponding to this link.  If there
   are multiple local addresses on the link, they are all listed in this
   sub-TLV.  Link-local address should not be included in this sub-TLV.

   The Local Interface IPv6 Address sub-TLV is TLV type 10, and is 16N
   octets in length, where N is the number of local addresses.


3.3 Remote Interface IPv6 Address

   The Remote Interface IPv6 Address sub-TLV specifies the IPv6
   address(es) of the neighbor's interface corresponding to this link.
   This and the local address are used to discern multiple parallel
   links between systems.  If the Link Type of the link is Multiaccess,
   the Remote Interface IPv6 Address is set to ::.  Link-local address
   should not be included in this sub-TLV.

   The Remote Interface IPv6 Address sub-TLV is TLV type 11, and is 16N
   octets in length, where N is the number of neighbor addresses.


4. Traffic-Engineering-LSA

   New LS type Traffic-Engineering-LSA is defined as Area scope LSA.
