           Multi-site EVPN based VXLAN using Border Gateways
                    draft-sharma-multi-site-evpn-02

Abstract

   This document describes the procedures for interconnecting two or
   more BGP based Ethernet VPN (EVPN) sites in a scalable fashion over
   an IP-only network.  The motivation is to support extension of EVPN
   sites without having to rely on typical Data Center Interconnect
   (DCI) technologies like MPLS/VPLS for the interconnection.  The
   requirements for such a deployment are very similar to the ones
   specified in RFC 7209 -- "Requirements for Ethernet VPN (EVPN)".

1.  Introduction

   BGP based Ethernet VPNs (EVPNs) are being used to support various VPN
   topologies with the motivation and requirements being discussed in
   detail in RFC7209 [RFC7209].  EVPN has been used to provide a Network
   Virtualization Overly (NVO) solution with a variety of tunnel
   encapsulation options over IP as described in [DCI-EVPN-OVERLAY].
   EVPN used for the Data center interconnect (DCI) at the WAN Edge is

   discussed in [DCI-EVPN-OVERLAY].  The EVPN DCI procedures are defined
   for IP and MPLS hand-off at the site boundaries.

   In the current EVPN deployments, there is a need to segment the EVPN
   domains within a Data Center (DC) primarily due to the service
   architecture and the scaling requirements around it.  The number of
   routes, tunnel end-points, and next-hops needed in the DC are larger
   than some of the hardware elements that are being deployed.  Network
   operators would like to ensure that they have means to have smaller
   sites within the data center, if they so desire, without having to
   have traditional DCI technologies to inter-connect them.  In essence,
   they want smaller multi-site EVPN domains with an IP backbone.

   Network operators today are using the Virtual Network Identifier
   (VNI) to designate a service.  However, they would like to have this
   service available to a smaller set of nodes within the DC for
   administrative reasons; in essence they want to break up the EVPN
   domain to multiple smaller sites.  An advantage of having a smaller
   footprint for these EVPN sites, implies that the various fault
   isolation domains are now more constrained.  It is also feasible to
   have features that can re-use the VNI space across these sites if
   desired.  The above mentioned motivations for having smaller multi-
   site EVPN domains are over and above the ones that are already
   detailed in RFC7209 [RFC7209].

   In this document we focus primarily on the VXLAN encapsulation for
   EVPN deployments.  We assume that the underlay provides simple IP
   connectivity.  We go into the details of the IP/VXLAN hand-off
   mechanisms, to interconnect these smaller sites, within the data
   center itself.  We describe this deployment model as a scalable
   multi-site EVPN (MS-EVPN) deployment.  The procedures described here
   go into substantial detail regarding interconnecting L2 and L3,
   unicast and multicast domains across multiple EVPN sites.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   o  Border Gateway (BG): This is the node that interacts with nodes
      within a site and with nodes that are external to the site.  For
      example, in a leaf-spine data center fabric, it can be a leaf, a
      spine, or a separate device acting as gateway to interconnect the
      sites.

   o  Anycast Border Gateway: A Virtual set of shared Border Gateways
      (or Next-hops) acting as Multiple entry-exit points for a site.

   o  Multipath Border Gateway: A Virtual set of unique border Gateways
      (or Next-hops) acting as a Multiple entry-exit points for a site.

   o  A-D: Auto-discovery.

3.  Multi-Site EVPN Overview

   In this section we describe the motivation, requirements, and
   framework of the multi-site EVPN enhancements.

3.1.  MS-EVPN Interconnect Requirements

   In this section we discuss the requirements and motivation for
   interconnecting different EVPN sites within a data center.  In
   general any interconnect technology has the following requirements:

   a.  Scalability: Multi-Site EVPN (MS-EVPN) should be able to
       interconnect multiple sites in a scalable fashion.  In other
       words, interconnecting such sites should not lead to one giant
       fabric with full mesh of end-to-end VXLAN tunnels across leafs in
       different sites.  This leads to scale issues with respect to
       managing large number of tunnel end-points and a large number of
       tunnel next-hops.  Also a huge flat fabric rules out option of
       ingress replication (IR) trees as number of replications becomes
       practically unachievable due to the internal bandwidth needed in
       hardware.

   b.  Multi-Destination traffic over unicast-only cloud: MS-EVPN
       mechanisms should be able to provide an efficient forwarding
       mechanism for multi-destination frames even if the underlay
       inter-site network is not capable of forwarding multicast frames.
       This requirement is meant to ensure that for the solution to work
       there are no additional constraints being requested of the IP
       network.  This allows for use of existing network elements as-is.

   c.  Maintain Site-specific Administrative control: The MS-EVPN
       technology should be able to interconnect fabrics from different
       Administrative domains.  It is possible that different sites have
       different VLAN-VNI mappings, use different underlay routing
       protocols, and/or have different PIM-SM group ranges etc.  It is
       expected that the technology should not impose any additional
       constraints on the various administrative domains.

   d.  Isolate fault domains: MS-EVPN technology hand-off should have
       capability to isolate traffic cross site boundaries and prevent

       defects to percolate from one site to another.  As an example, a
       broadcast storm in a site should not lead to meltdown of all
       other sites.

   e.  Loop detection and prevention: In the scenarios where flood
       domains are stretched across fabrics, interconnecting sites are
       very vulnerable to loops and flood storms.  There is a need to
       provide comprehensive loop detection and prevention capabilities.

   f.  Plug-and-play and extensibility: Addition of new sites or
       increasing capacity of existing sites should be achievable in a
       completely plug-and-play fashion.  This essentially means that
       all control plane and forwarding states (L2 or L3 interconnect)
       should be built in downstream allocation mode.  MS-EVPN should
       not pose any maximum requirements on the scale and capacity, it
       should be easily extendable on those metrics.

3.2.  MS-EVPN Interconnect concept and framework

   EVPN with an IP-only interconnect is conceptualized as multiple site-
   local EVPN control planes and IP forwarding domains interconnected
   via a single common EVPN control and IP forwarding domain.  Every
   EVPN node is identified with a unique site-scope identifier.  A site-
   local EVPN domain consists of EVPN nodes with the same site
   identifier.  Border gateways on one hand are also part of site-
   specific EVPN domain and on other hand part of a common EVPN domain
   to interconnect with Border Gateways from other sites.  Although a
   border gateway has only a single explicit site-id (that of the site
   it is a member of), it can be considered to also have a second
   implicit site-id, that of the interconnect-domain which has
   membership of all the BG's from all sites that are being
   interconnected.  This implicit site-id membership is derived by the
   presence of the Border A-D route announced by that border gateway
   node (please refer to Section 4.1 for details of the route format).

   These border gateways discover each other through EVPN Border A-D
   routes and act as both control and forwarding plane gateway across
   sites.  This will facilitate site-specific nodes to visualize all
   other sites to be reachable only via its Border Gateways.

   We describe the MS-EVPN deployment model using the topology below.
   In the topology there are 3 sites, Site A, Site B, and Site C that
   are inter-connected using IP.  This entire topology is deemed to be
   part of the same Data Center.  In most deployments these sites can be
   thought of as pods, which may span a rack, a row, or multiple rows in
   the data center, depending on the size of domain desired for scale
   and fault and/or administrative isolation domains.

   In this topology, site-local nodes are connected to each other by
   iBGP EVPN peering and Border Gateways are connected by eBGP Muti-hop
   EVPN peering via inter-site cloud.  We explicitly spell this out to
   ensure that we can re-use BGP semantics of route announcement between
   and across the sites.  There are other BGP mechanisms to instantiate
   this and they are not discussed in this document.  This implies that
   each domain has its own AS number associated with it.  In the
   topology, only 2 border gateway per site are shown; this is more for
   ease of illustration and explanation.  The technology poses no such
   limitation.  As mentioned earlier, site-specific EVPN domain will
   consists of only site-local nodes in the sites.  A Border Gateway is

   logically partitioned into site specific EVPN domain towards the site
   and into common EVPN domain towards other sites.  This facilitates
   them to acts as control and forwarding plane gateway for forwarding
   traffic across sites.

   EVPN nodes with in a site will discover each other via regular EVPN
   procedures and build site-local bidirectional VXLAN tunnels and
   multi-destination trees from leaves to Border Gateways.  Border
   Gateways will discover each other by A-D routes with unique site-
   identifiers (as described in Section 4.1) and build inter-site bi-
   directional VXLAN tunnels and Multi-destination trees between them.
   We thus build an end-to-end bidirectional forwarding path across all
   sites by stitching (and not by stretching end-to-end) site-local
   VXLAN tunnels with inter-site VXLAN tunnels.

   In essence, a MS-EVPN fabric is proposed to be built in complete
   downstream and modular fashion.

   o  Site-local Bridging domains are interconnected ONLY via Border
      Gateways with Bridging domains from other sites.  Such
      interconnect do not assume uniform mappings of mac-vrf VNI-VLAN
      across sites and stitches such bridging domains in complete
      downstream fashion using EVPN route advertisements.

   o  Site-local Routing domains are interconnected ONLY via Border
      Gateways with Routing domains from other sites.  Such interconnect
      do not assume uniform mappings of IP VRF-VNI across sites and
      stitches such routing domains in complete downstream fashion using
      EVPN route advertisements.

   o  Site-local Flood domains are interconnected ONLY via Border
      Gateways with flood domains from other sites.  Such interconnect
      do not assume uniform mappings of mac-vrf VNI across sites (or
      mechanisms to build flood domains with in site) and stitches such
      flood domains in complete downstream fashion using EVPN route
      advertisements.  It however do not exclude possibility of building
      an end-to-end flood domain, if desired for other reasons.

   o  There could be potential use cases where border gateways should
      behave as gateway for a subset of VXLAN tunnels and an underlay
      pass through for the rest.  In other words, MS-EVPN fabric can be
      built by stitching VXLAN tunnels at border gateways while
      providing flexibility for other VXLAN (or VNI) tunnels to pass
      through border gateways as native L3 underlay.  The procedure
      defined here provides flexibility to accommodate such use cases.

   The above architecture satisfies the constraints laid out in
   Section 3.1.  For example, the size of a domain may be made dependent



Sharma, et al.            Expires July 9, 2017                  [Page 7]

   on the route and next-hop scale that can be supported by the
   deployment of the network nodes.  There are no constraints on the
   network that connects the nodes within the domain or across the
   domains.  In the event multicast capability is available and enabled,
   the nodes can use those resources.  In the event the underlay is
   connected using unicast semantics, creation of ingress replication
   lists ensure that multi-destination frames reach their destinations.
   The domains may have their own deployment constraints, and the
   overlay does not need any form of stretching.  It is within the
   control of the administrator with respect to containing fault
   isolation domains.  The automated discovery of the border nodes needs
   no further configurations for existing deployed domains.

4.  Multi-site EVPN Interconnect Procedures

   In this section we describe the new functionalities in the Border
   Gateway nodes for interconnecting EVPN sites within the DC.

4.1.  Border Gateway Discovery

   Border Gateway discovery will facilitate termination and re-
   origination of inter-site VXLAN tunnels.  Such discovery provides
   flexibility for intra-site leaf-to-leaf VXLAN tunnels to co-exists
   with inter-site tunnels terminating on Border Gateways.  In other
   words, border gateways discovery will facilitate learning of VXLAN
   tunnel termination points while providing flexibility for such border
   gateways to behave as native L3 transit for other VXLAN tunnels.

   Border Gateways leverage the Type-1 A-D route type defined in RFC7432
   [RFC7432].  Border Gateways in different sites will use Type-1 A-D
   routes with unique site-identifiers to announce themselves as
   "Borders" to other border gateways.  Nodes within the same site MUST
   be configured or auto-generate to announce the same site-identifier.
   Nodes that are not configured to be a border node will build VXLAN
   tunnels only between each member of the site (which it is aware due
   to the site-identifier that is additionally announced by them).
   Border nodes will additionally build VXLAN tunnels between itself and
   other border nodes that are announced with a different site
   identifier.  Note that the site-identifier is encoded within the ESI
   label itself as described below.

   In this specification, we define a new Ethernet Segment Type (as
   described in Section 5 of RFC7432 [RFC7432]) that can be auto-
   generated or configured by the operator.

   o  Type 6 (T=0x06) - This type indicates a multi-site router-ID ESI
      Value that can be auto-generated or configured by the operator.
      The ESI Value is constructed as follows:

Internet-Draft               Multi-site EVPN                January 2017


      *  Router ID (4 octets): The system router ID MUST be encoded in
         the high-order 4 octets of the ESI Value field.  In case of
         both Anycast Border Gateway and Multipath Border Gateway, this
         field carries unique router ID of Border gateways.

      *  Site Identifier (4 octets): The Site Identifier and its value
         MUST be encoded in 4 octets next to the Router ID.

      *  Reserved (1 octet): The low-order octet of the ESI Value will
         be set to 0 and will be ignored on receipt.

   Along with the Type-1 A-D routes, border nodes MUST announce an ESI
   label extended community with such A-D routes.  They will also
   announce the Type-4 Ethernet Segment routes with the ESI Label
   extended community (defined in Section 7.5 of RFC7432 [RFC7432] and
   shown below in Figure 2) in order to perform the Designated Forwarder
   election among the Border gateways of the same site.  These Type-4
   routes and ESI Label extended community will carry a new bit in the
   Flags field to indicate that the DF election is for Border gateways
   as against the traditional Ethernet segment DF election.  Routes with
   such bits set are generated only by Border Gateways and imported by
   all site-local leafs, site-local Border Gateways, and inter-site
   Border gateways.

   The lowest order bit of Flags Octet in ESI Label extended community
   has been defined to address multihoming with the Single-Active or
   All-Active redundancy mode.  In this specification, we define the the
   Second Low order bit of Flag Octet in ESI Label extended Community.
   It MUST be set to 1 by border gateway nodes if it is willing to take
   part in the DF election for the VNI carried in the associated ESI
   label.

   Type-4 Ethernet Segment routes with the ESI Label extended community
   will be leveraged to perform Designated Forwarder election among the
   Border gateways of the same site.  ESI label extended community
   encoding will be same as described above for Type-1 A-D routes.  Site
   Identifier encoding in ESI label extended community will help border
   gateways to negotiate DF winner with in a site and ignore Type-4
   routes from other sites.

   These A-D routes are advertised with mac-VRF and IP-VRF RTs depending
   on whether the VNI carried is a mac-VRF VNI or an IP VRF VNI.

   After a Border Gateway is provisioned, Border A-D routes will be
   announced after some delay interval from all border gateways.  This
   will provide sufficient time to learn Border A-D routes from Border
   Gateways of different sites.  Border gateways will not be used to
   build VXLAN tunnels from same-site Border Gateways.

   Once Border Gateways are discovered, any Type-2/Type-5 routes will be
   terminated and re-originated on such Border Gateways.  Similarly
   Type-1, Type-3, Type-4 from other sites will be terminated at the
   Border Gateways.  (Also see section 8 for Type-1 handling for loop
   detection and prevention across sites)

   As has been defined in the specifications, Type 2, Type 3, and Type 5
   routes carry downstream VNI labels.  These A-D routes will help to
   pre-build VXLAN tunnels in the common EVPN domain for L2, L3, and
   Multi-Destination traffic.  Also these A-D routes will help in
   correlating next-hop of EVPN routes and will facilitate in rewriting
   next-hop attributes before re-advertising these routes from other
   sites to a given site.  This provides flexibility to keep different
   VNI-VLAN mapping in different sites and still able to interconnect L3
   and L2 domains.

   All control plane and data plane states are interconnected in a
   complete downstream fashion.  For example, BGP import rules for a
   Type 3 route should be able to extend a flood domain for a VNI and
   flood traffic destined to advertised EVPN node should carry the VNI
   which is announced in Type 3 route.  Similarly Type 2, Type 5 control
   and forwarding states should be interconnected in a complete
   downstream fashion.

4.2.  Border Gateway Provisioning

   Border Gateway nodes manage both the control-plane communications and
   the data forwarding plane for any inter-site traffic.  Border Gateway
   functionality in an EVPN site SHOULD be enabled on more than one node
   in the network for redundancy and high-availability purposes.  Any
   external Type-2/Type-5 routes that are received by the BGs of a site
   are advertised to all the intra-site nodes by all the BGs.  For
   internal Type-2/Type-5 routes received by the BG's from the intra-
   site nodes, all the BGs of a site would advertise them to the remote
   BG's, so any L2/L3 known unicast traffic to internal destinations
   could be sent to any one of the local BG's by remote sources.  For
   known L2 and L3 unicast traffic, all of the individual border gateway
   nodes will behave either as single logical forwarding node or a set
   of active forwarding nodes.  This can be perceived by intra-site



Sharma, et al.            Expires July 9, 2017                 [Page 10]

Internet-Draft               Multi-site EVPN                January 2017


   nodes as multiple entry/exit points for inter-site traffic.  For
   unknown unicast/multi-destination traffic, there must be a designated
   forwarder election mechanism to determine which node would perform
   the primary forwarding role at any given point in time, to ensure
   there is no duplication of traffic for any given flow (See
   Section 4.2.1).

4.2.1.  Border Gateway Designated Forwarder Election

   In the presence of more than one Border Gateway nodes in a site,
   forwarding of multi-destination L2 or L3 traffic both into the site
   and out of the site needs to be carried out by a single node.  Border
   Gateways between same site will run a Designated forwarder election
   per MAC-VRF VNI for multi-destination traffic across the site.
   Border A-D routes coming from different site will not trigger DF
   election and will only be cached to terminate VXLAN tunnels from such
   border gateways.

   Border Gateway DF election will leverage Type-4 EVPN route and
   Ethernet segment DF election defined in RFC7432 [RFC7432].  Ethernet
   segment and ESI label extended community will be encoded as explained
   in Border Gateway discovery procedures.  ESI label extended community
   is MUST to be announced with such routes.  DF election will ignore
   such routes that are announced by border gateways which have a
   different site identifier value in them.

   This DF election could be done independently by each candidate border
   gateway, by subjecting an ordered "candidate list" of all the BG's
   present in the same site (identified by reception of the Border A-D
   routes per-VNI with the same site-id as itself) to a hash-function on
   a per-VNI basis.  All the candidate border gateways of the same site
   are required to use a uniform hash-function to yield the same result.
   Failure events which lead to a BG losing all of its connectivity to
   the IP interconnect backbone should trigger the BG to withdraw its
   Border A-D route(s), to indicate to other BG's of the site that it is
   no longer a candidate BG.

   There are two modes proposed for Border gateway provisioning.

4.2.2.  Anycast Border Gateway

   In this mode all border gateways share same gateway IP and rewrite
   EVPN next-hop attributes with a shared logical next-hop entity.
   However, these Gateways will maintain unique gateway IP to facilitate
   building IR trees from site-local nodes to forward Multi-Destination
   traffic.  EVPN Type 2, Type 5 routes will be advertised to the nodes
   in the site from all border gateways and Border gateway will run DF
   election per VNI for Multi destination traffic.  Type 3 routes may be

   advertised by the DF winner Border gateway for a given VNI so that
   only DF will receive and forward inter-site traffic.  It is also
   possible to advertise and draw traffic by all Border Gateways at a
   site to improve convergence properties of the network.  In case of
   multi-destination trees built by non-EVPN procedures (say PIM), all
   border gateways will receive but only DF winner will forward traffic.

   This mode is useful when there is no preference between different
   border-gateways to forward traffic from different VNIs.  Standard
   data plane hashing of VXLAN header will load balance traffic among
   Border Gateways.

   Additionally, it is recommended that border gateway be enabled in the
   Anycast mode wherein the BG functionality is available to the rest of
   the network as a single logical entity (as in Anycast) for inter-site
   communication.  In the absence of capability for Anycast, the BG
   could be enabled as individual gateways (Single-Active BG) wherein a
   single node will perform the active BG role for a given flow at a
   given time.  As of now, the Border Gateway system mac of the other
   border nodes belonging to the same site is expected to be configured
   out-of-band.

4.2.3.  Multi-path Border Gateway

   In this mode, Border gateways will rewrite EVPN Next-hop attributes
   with unique next-hop entities.  This provides flexibility to apply
   usual policies and pick per-VRF, per-VNI or per-flow primary/backup
   border Gateways.  Hence, an intra-site node will see each BG as a
   next-hop for any external L2 or L3 unicast destination, and would
   perform an ECMP path selection to load-balance traffic sent to
   external destinations.  In case an intra-site node is not capable of
   performing ECMP hash based path-selection (possibly some L2
   forwarding implementations), the node is expected to choose one of
   the BG's as its designated forwarder.  EVPN Type 2, Type 5 routes
   will be advertised to the nodes in the site from all border gateways
   and Border gateway will run DF election per VNI for Multi destination
   traffic.  Type 3 routes will be advertised by DF winner Border
   gateway for a given VNI so that only DF will receive and forward
   inter-site traffic.  It is also possible to advertise and draw
   traffic by all Border Gateways at a site to improve convergence
   properties of the network.  In case of multi-destination trees built
   by non-EVPN procedures (say PIM), all border gateways will receive
   but only DF winner will forward traffic.

4.3.  EVPN route processing at Border Gateway

   Border gateways will build EVPN peering on processing A-D routes from
   other Border gateways.  Route targets MAY be auto-generated based on
   some site-specific identifier.  If BGP AS number is used as site-
   specific identifier, import and export route targets can be auto-
   generated as explained in RFC7432 [RFC7432].  This will facilitate
   site-local nodes to import routes from other nodes in same site and
   from its Border Gateways.  Also this will prevent routes exchange
   between nodes from different sites.  However, in this auto-generated
   scheme, import mechanism on Border Gateway should be relaxed to allow
   unconditional import of Border A-D routes from other border gateways.
   Also the routes which are imported at Border Gateway and re-
   advertised should implement a mechanism to avoid looping of updates
   should they come back at Border Gateways.

   Type 2/Type 5 EVPN routes will be rewritten with Border Gateway IP,
   Border Gateway system mac as next-hop and re-advertised.  Only EVPN
   routes received from discovered Border gateways with different site
   identifiers will be rewritten and re-advertised.  This will avoid
   rewriting every EVPN update if border gateways are also acting as
   Route reflector (RR) for site-local EVPN peering.  Also this will
   help in interoperating MS-EVPN fabric with sites which do not have
   Border Gateway functionality.

   There are few mechanisms suggested below for re-advertising these
   inter-site routes to a site and provide connectivity of inter-site
   hosts and subnets.

   o  All routes everywhere : In this mode all inter-site EVPN Type2/
      Type5 routes are downloaded on site-local leafs from Border
      Gateways.  In other words, every leaf in the MS-EVPN fabric will
      have routes from every intra-site and inter-site leafs.  This
      mechanism is best-fit for the scenarios where inter-site traffic
      is as voluminous as intra-site flow traffic.  Also this mechanism
      preserves usual glean processing, silent host discovery and
      unknown traffic handling at the leafs.

   o  Default bridging and routing to Border Gateways : In this mode,
      all received inter-site EVPN Type 2/Type 5 routes will be
      installed only at Border Gateways and will not be advertised in
      the site.  Border Gateways will inject Type 5 default routes to
      site-local nodes and avoid re-advertising Type 2 from other sites.
      This mode provides scaling advantage by not downloading all inter-
      site routes to every leaf in MS-EVPN fabric.  This mechanism MAY
      require glean processing and unknown traffic handling to be
      tailored to provide efficient traffic forwarding.




Sharma, et al.            Expires July 9, 2017                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft               Multi-site EVPN                January 2017


   o  Site-scope flow registry and discovery : This mechanism provides
      scaling advantage by downloading inter-site routes on-demand.  It
      provides scaling advantages of default routing with out need to
      tailor glean processing and unknown traffic handling at the leafs.
      Leafs will create on-demand flow registry on their border Gateways
      and based on this flow registry border gateways will advertise
      Type 2 routes in a site.  In other words, assuming that we have a
      trigger to send the EVPN routes that are needed by the site for
      conversational learning from the Border Gateways, we can optimize
      on the control plane state that is needed at the various leaf
      nodes.  Hardware programming can be further optimized based on
      actual conversations needed by the leaf, as opposed to to the ones
      needed by the site.  We will describe a mechanism in the appendix
      with respect to ARP processing at the Border Gateway.

   Type 3 routes will be imported and processed on border gateways from
   other border gateways but MUST NOT be advertised again.  In both
   modes (Anycast and Multipath), Type 3 routes will be generated
   locally and advertised by DF winner Border Gateway with unique
   gateway IP.  This will facilitate building fast converging flood
   domain connectivity inter-site and intra-site and on same time
   avoiding duplicate traffic by electing DF winner to forward multi-
   destination inter-site traffic.

4.4.  Multi-Destination tree between Border Gateways

   The procedures described here recommends building an Ingress
   Replication (IR) tree between Border Gateways.  This will facilitate
   every site to independently build site-specific Multi destination
   trees.  Multi-destination end-to-end trees between leafs could be PIM
   (site 1) + IR (between border Gateways) + PIM(site 2) or IR-IR-IR or
   PIM-IR-IR.  However this does not rule out using IR-PIM-IR or end-to-
   end PIM to build multi-destination trees end-to-end.

   Border Gateways will generate Type 3 routes with unique gateway IP
   and advertise to Border Gateways of other sites.  These Type 3 routes
   will help in building IR trees between border gateways.  However only
   DF winner per VNI will forward multi-destination traffic across
   sites.

   As Border Gateways are part of both site-specific and inter-site
   Multi-destination IR trees, split-horizon mechanism will be used to
   avoid loops.  Multi-destination tree with Border gateway as root to
   other sites (or Border-Gateways) will be in a separate horizon group.
   Similarity Multi-destination IR tree with Border Gateway as root to
   site-local nodes will be in another split horizon group.

Internet-Draft               Multi-site EVPN                January 2017


   If PIM is used to build Multi-Destination trees in site-specific
   domain, all Border gateway will join such PIM trees and draw multi-
   destination traffic.  However only DF Border Gateway will forward
   traffic towards other sites.

4.5.  Inter-site Unicast traffic

   As site-local nodes will see all inter-site EVPN routes via Border
   Gateways, VXLAN tunnels will be built between leafs and site-local
   Border Gateways and Inter-site VXLAN tunnels will be built between
   Border gateways in different sites.  An end-to-end VXLAN
   bidirectional forwarding path between inter-site leafs will consist
   of VXLAN tunnel from leaf (say Site A) to its Border Gateway, another
   VXLAN tunnel from Border Gateway to Border Gateway in another site
   (say site B) and Border gateway to leaf (in site B).  Such
   arrangement of tunnels are very scalable as a full mesh of VXLAN
   tunnels across inter-site leafs is substituted by combination of
   intra-site and inter-site tunnels.

   L2 and L3 unicast frames from site-local leafs will reach border
   gateway using VXLAN encapsulation.  At Border gateway, VXLAN header
   is stripped out and another VXLAN header is pushed to sent frames to
   destination site Border Gateway.  Destination site Border gateway
   will strip off VXLAN header and push another VXLAN header to send
   frame to the destination site leaf.

4.6.  Inter-site Multi-destination traffic

   Multi-destination traffic will be forwarded from one site to other
   site only by DF for that VNI.  As frames reach Border Gateway from
   site-local nodes, VXLAN header will be popped and another VXLAN
   header (derived from downstream Type3 EVPN routes) will be pushed to
   forward frame to destination site border gateway.  Similarly
   destination site Border Gateway will strip off VXLAN header and
   forward frame after pushing another VXLAN header towards the
   destination leaf.

   As explained in Section 4.4, split horizon mechanism will be used to
   avoid looping of inter-site multi-destination frames.

4.7.  Host Mobility

   Host movement handling will be same as defined in RFC7432 [RFC7432].
   When host moves, EVPN Type 2 routes with updated sequence number will
   be propagated to every EVPN node.  When a host moves inter-site, only
   Border gateways may see EVPN updates with both next-hop attributes
   and sequence number changes and leafs may see updates only with

   updated sequence numbers.  However in other cases both Border gateway
   and leafs may see next-hop and sequence number changes.

5.  Convergence

5.1.  Fabric to Border Gateway Failure

   If a Border Gateway is lost, Border gateway next-hop will be
   withdrawn for Type 2 routes.  Also per-VNI DF election will be
   triggered to chose new DF.  DF new winner will become forwarder of
   Multi-destination inter-site traffic.

5.2.  Border Gateway to Border Gateway Failures

   In case where inter-site cloud has link failures, direct forwarding
   path between border gateways can be lost.  In this case, traffic from
   one site can reach other site via border gateway of an intermediate
   site.  However this will be addressed like regular underlay failure
   and traffic terminations end-points will still stay same for inter-
   site traffic flows.

6.  Interoperability

   The procedures defined here are only for Border Gateways.  Therefore
   other EVPN nodes in the network should be RFC7432 [RFC7432] compliant
   to operate in such topologies.

   As the procedures described here are applicable only after receiving
   Border A-D route, if other domains are connected which are not
   capable of such multi-site gateway model, they can work in regular
   EVPN mode.  The exact procedures will be detailed in a future version
   of the draft.

   The procedures here provides flexibility to connect non-EVPN VXLAN
   sites by provisioning Border Gateways on such sites and inter-
   connecting such Border Gateways by Border Gateways of other sites.
   Such Border Gateways in non-EVPN VXLAN sites will play dual role of
   EVPN gateway towards common EVPN domain and non-EVPN gateway towards
   non-EVPN VXLAN site.

7.  Isolation of Fault Domains

   Isolation of network defects requires policies like storm control,
   security ACLs etc to be implemented at site boundaries.  Border
   gateways should be capable of inspecting inner payload of packets
   received from VXLAN tunnels and enforce configured policies to
   prevent defects percolating from one part to rest of the network.

8.  Loop detection and Prevention

   Customer L2 network deploy some flavor of Spanning tree protocol
   (STP) to detect and prevent loops.  Also Customer L2 segments deploy
   some form of multihoming to connect L2 segments to EVPN nodes or
   VTEPs.  Such multihoming connectivity takes care of preventing L2
   loops by multihoming mechanisms at the VTEPs.  However
   misconfiguration or other unexpected events in the customer L2
   segments can lead to inconsistent connectivity to VTEPs leading to L2
   loops.

   This specification leverages Type-2 encoding of ESI label extended
   community in Type-1 A-D route type as defined in RFC7432 [RFC7432] to
   exchange STP root bridge information among VTEPs.  When VTEPs
   discovers same STP root bridge from VTEPs which are not multihoming
   VTEP peers for a given L2 segment, it signals possibility of loop and
   forwarding engine prunes VNI from the server facing ports to cut down
   loop.  As root bridge conflict across VTEPs is resolved, forwarding
   engine will reestablish VNI on the server facing ports.  This
   mechanism can coexist with other mechanism like fast mac move
   detections and is recommended as additional protection to prevent L2
   loops poised by inconsistent connectivity of customer L2 segments to
   L3 MS-EVPN fabric.

   Such route advertisement should be originated by every EVPN node and
   terminated at the border gateways.  However if there is possibility
   of server facing L2 segments to be stretched across sites, such
   routes can be terminated and re-originated with out modifications to
   be received by every other EVPN node.  This behavior is exception to
   usual guideline of terminating (and re-originating if required) all
   routes types at border gateway.  However such exception will help in
   detecting loops if a customer L2 segment is inconsistently connected
   to VTEPs in different sites.

   Also as defined in Section 4.2.1 border gateways uses mechanisms like
   Designated Forwarder and Split Horizon forwarding to prevent inter-
   site loops in this network.
