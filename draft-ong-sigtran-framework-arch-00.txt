  Abstract
  
  This document defines an architecture framework for transporting PSTN
  signaling information over IP.  It defines an architectural model, and
  identifies functional requirements and performance requirements for
  signaling transport.  PSTN signaling must be encapsulated and identified
  for transport over IP networks, and signaling performance requirements
  for message loss, delay, etc. must be supported by protocol mechanisms.

  1. Introduction
  
  1.1 Overview
  
  This document identifies an architecture and set of requirements for 
  signaling transport over IP networks.  
  
  1.2 Terminology
  
  The following terms have been identified in related work [1,2].
  
  Media Gateway (MG): 
  A MG terminates PSTN facilities (trunks, loops), packetizes the media stream
  for IP, if it is not already packetized, and delivers packetized traffic 
  to the IP network. Examples of MGs are NAS (Network Access Servers) and VoIP 
  gateways. 
  
  Media Gateway Controller (MC): 
  A MC provides the call control "intelligence" as well as resource management
  of the media gateways.  The MC determines call handling based on service logic
  and resource availability at the MG.  The MC sends commands to the MG to,
  e.g., terminate a call from PSTN and deliver voice packets to an IP destination.
  
  Service Control Point (SCP):
  This is a node in an SS7 network that provides centralized service logic 
  and data, such as call routing information.
  
  Signal Transfer Point (STP):
  This is a node in an SS7 network that routes signaling messages based on
  their destination address in the SS7 network
  
  Signaling Gateway (SG): 
  An SG is an entity that receives/sends PSTN native signaling at the edge 
  of the IP network. The SG function may relay, translate or terminate SS7 
  signaling in an SS7-Internet Gateway. The SG may also transport (back-haul) 
  Q.931 signaling to an MC.
  
  Backhaul: 
  Backhaul refers to the transport of signaling from the point of interface
  for the associated data stream (i.e., the MG) back to the point of call
  processing (i.e., the MC), if this is not local.
  
  
  1.3 Requirements
  
  Requirements for signaling transport include the following:
  - Protocol encapsulation and identification
  - Path and node management
  - Packet loss recovery and resequencing
  - Flow control

  1.4 Comparisons with Other Efforts
  
  Signaling transport focuses on transparent transport of PSTN-based signaling
  protocols over IP networks.   The scope of this work includes definition of
  encapsulation methods, end-to-end protocol mechanisms and use of IP capabilities
  such as differentiated services to support the functional and performance
  requirements for signaling.
  
  Since the focus is on transport, the following items will be outside the scope
  of the signaling transport work:
  - definition of the call control protocols themselves
  - definition of protocol conversion for call control, such as conversion from
    Channel Associated Signaling (CAS) to message signaling protocols.
  
  The signaling transport will, however, be defined in such a way as to support
  encapsulation and carriage of a variety of call control protocols. 
  
  
  
  2. Signaling Transport Architectural Model 
  
  2.1  Signaling for Media Gateway Interface 
  
  2.1.1  Gateway Component Functions 
  
  Figure 1 defines a commonly defined functional model for the VoIP Gateway 
  that separates out the functions of SG, MC and MG.  This model may be 
  implemented in a number of ways, with functions implemented in separate 
  devices or combined in single devices.
  
  Where physical separation exists between functional entities, Signaling 
  Transport can be applied to ensure that PSTN signaling information is 
  transported between entities with the required functionality and 
  performance.

  2.1.2  SS7 Interworking 
  
  For interworking with SS7-controlled PSTN networks, the SG terminates the
  SS7 link and transfers the signaling information to the MC using signaling
  transport.  The MG terminates the intermachine trunk and controls the trunk
  based on the control signaling it receives from the MC.  Depending on
  implementation, the SG and MC may be in separate devices or co-located.
  
  An alternative case (c) is the SS7 F-link, where the signaling link is 
  facility-associated, and is terminated by the same device (i.e., the MG) 
  that terminates the intermachine trunk.  In this case, the SG function is 
  co-located with the MG function, as shown in Figure 2.
  
  In the latter case, the signaling messages are "backhauled" to the MC for 
  call processing, using signaling transport functionality.
  
  Note: exactly what layers of SS7 are terminated above is ffs.

  2.1.3  ISDN Interworking 
  
  In ISDN access signaling, the signaling channel is carried along with data
  channels, so that the SG function for handling Q.931 signaling 
  is co-located with the MG function for handling the data stream.  Where 
  Q.931 is then transported to the MC for call processing, signaling transport
  would be used between the SG function and MC.  This is shown in Figure 3 below.

  2.1.4  CAS Backhaul 
  
  In the case of Channel Associated Signaling (CAS), the signaling is 
  carried coupled with the data stream, and as in the Q.931 case, the
  PSTN signaling gateway function (SG) is co-located with the media gateway
  function (MG).  It is assumed here that the CAS is converted to a packet-
  based PSTN signaling protocol and backhauled to the MC using signaling 
  transport capabilities. (Need for this tbd with navdec group).
  
  2.2  Signaling for Database Access 
  
  Transaction Capabilities (TCAP or TC) is the application part within SS7
  that is used for non-circuit-related signaling such as database access.
  TCAP/TC signaling within IP networks may be used for cross-access between
  entities in the SS7 domain and the IP domain, such as:
  - access from an SS7 network to an IP network database
  - access from an SS7 network to an MC
  - access from an MC to an SS7 network element
  - access from an IP database to an SS7 network element 
  
  A basic functional model for TCAP/TC over IP is shown in Figure 4.
