  Signalling Authoritative DoT support in DS records, with key pinning
             draft-vandijk-dprive-ds-dot-signal-and-pin-00

Abstract

   This document specifies a way to signal the usage of DoT, and the
   pinned keys for that DoT usage, in authoritative servers.  This
   signal lives on the parent side of delegations, in DS records.  To
   ensure easy deployment, the signal is defined in terms of (C)DNSKEY.

1.  Introduction

   Even quite recently, DNS was a completely unencrypted protocol, with
   no protection against snooping.  In the past few years, this
   landscape has shifted.  The connections between stubs and resolvers
   are now often protected by DoT, DoH, or other protocols that provide
   privacy.

Internet-Draft            ds-dot-signal-and-pin                 May 2020


   This document introduces a way to signal, from the parent side of a
   delegation, that the name servers hosting the delegated zone support
   DoT, and with which TLS/X.509 keys.  This proposal does not require
   any changes in authoritative name servers, other than (possibly
   through an external process) actually offering DoT on port 853
   [RFC7858].  DNS registry operators (such as TLD operators) also need
   to make no changes, unless they filter uploaded DNSKEY/DS records on
   acceptable DNSKEY algorithms, in which case they would need to add
   algorithm TBD to that list.

   This document was inspired by, and borrows heavily from,
   [I-D.bretelle-dprive-dot-for-insecure-delegations].

2.  Document work

   This document lives on GitHub (https://github.com/PowerDNS/parent-
   signals-dot/blob/master/draft-vandijk-dprive-ds-dot-signal-and-pin/
   draft-vandijk-dprive-ds-dot-signal-and-pin.md); proposed text and
   editorial changes are very much welcomed there, but any functional
   changes should always first be discussed on the IETF DPRIVE WG (dns-
   privacy) mailing list.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   CDNSKEY record  as defined in [RFC7344][RFC8078]

   DS record  as defined in [RFC4034]

   DNSKEY record  as defined in [RFC4034]

4.  Summary

   To enable the signaling of DoT a new DNSKEY algorithm type TBD is
   added.  If a resolver with support for TBD encounters a DS record
   with the DNSKEY algorithm type TBD it MUST connect to the
   authoritative servers for this domain via DoT.  It MUST use the
   hashes attached to the DS records with DNSKEY algorithm type TBD to
   check whether the public key supplied by the authoritative nameserver
   is valid.  If the DoT connection is unsuccessful or the public key
   supplied the server does not match one of the DS digests, the
   resolver MUST NOT fall back to unencrypted Do53.

Internet-Draft            ds-dot-signal-and-pin                 May 2020


   The pseudo DNSKEY record MUST contain Base64 encoded ([RFC4648] 4.)
   DER SubjectPublicKeyInfo as defined in [RFC5280] 4.1.2.7.  Since the
   cert provided by the TLS server over the wire is already DER encoded
   this makes for easy validation.  The pseudo DNSKEY algorithm type TBD
   is algorithm agnostic, like the TLSA record, since the DER encoded
   data already contains information about the used algorithm.
   Algorithm support SHOULD be handled at the TLS handshake level, which
   means a DNS application SHOULD NOT need to be aware of the algorithm
   used by its TLS library.  The pseudo DNSKEY record MUST NOT be
   present in the zone.  The procedure for hashing the pseudo DNSKEY
   record is the same as for a normal DNSKEY as defined in RFC4034.

   The pseudo DNSKEY type can be used in CDNSKEY and CDS (as defined in
   [RFC7344]) records.  These records MAY be present in the zone.

   For those familiar with TLSA ([RFC6698]), key matching for this
   protocol is identical to that provided by "TLSA 3 1 0" for (C)DNSKEY.
   For the DS case, key matching is similar to "TLSA 3 1 x" where x is
   not zero, except that the rest of the (C)DNSKEY, including the owner
   name, gets prepended before hashing.

5.  Example

   This section will take you through the various parts of this
   specification, by example.

   We assume that we are working with a domain "example.com." with one
   name server, "ns.example.com.".

5.1.  Generating and placing the (C)DNSKEY/DS records

   We will walk you through the CDNSKEY/DS generation, demonstrating it
   in terms of basic shell scripting and some common tools.

   First, we extract the SubjectPublicKeyInfo:

   openssl s_client -connect ns.example.com:853 < /dev/null \
     | openssl x509 -noout -pubkey > pubkey.pem

   This gives us a file "pubkey.pem" that looks like this (abridged):

   -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
   MIICIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAg8AMIICCgKCAgEAxH2a6NxIcw5527b04kKy
   ...
   71AWASNoX2GQh7eaQPDD9i8CAwEAAQ==
   -----END PUBLIC KEY-----

   To turns this into a CDNSKEY:

   1.  remove the header and footer

   2.  remove all newlines

   In other words:

   openssl s_client -connect ns.example.com:853 </dev/null \
     | openssl x509 -noout -pubkey \
     | sed '1d;$d' \
     | tr -d '\n'

   Then we prepend

   example.com. IN CDNSKEY 0 3 225

   so that we end up with

   example.com. IN CDNSKEY 0 3 225 MIICIj...AAQ==

   If your registry accepts CDNSKEY, or DNSKEY via EPP, you are done -
   you can get your DS placed.

   To generate the DS, do something like this:

   echo example.com. IN DNSKEY 0 3 225 MIICIj...AAQ== \
     | ldns-key2ds -f -n -2 /dev/stdin
   example.com.    3600    IN      DS      7573 225 2 fcb6...c26c

   [TODO: what if a server has different keys depending on crypto
   algorithm negotiation? probably need some words on that somewhere,
   perhaps not (only) in this section]

6.  Implementation

   The subsection titles in this section attempt to follow the
   terminology from [RFC8499] in as far as it has suitable terms.
   'Implementation' is understood to mean both 'code changes' and
   'operational changes' here.

6.1.  Authoritative server changes

   This specification defines no changes to query processing in
   authoritative servers.

   If DoT-signaling DS records are published for a zone, all name
   servers for the zone (from both the parent-side and child-side NS
   RRsets) SHOULD offer DoT service on port 853, and when they do, they
   SHOULD do so using keys present in the DS RRset.  However, there are



van Dijk, et al.        Expires 20 November 2020                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            ds-dot-signal-and-pin                 May 2020


   potential cases where this is not possible, like having multiple DNS
   providers.  In this case the name servers that do not support DoT
   SHOULD respond with a RST response on the port tcp/853 to prevent
   name resolution slow downs.

6.2.  Validating resolver changes

   If a resolver succesfully uses DoT with a nameserver as specified in
   this document, it MAY assume DoT is always available for that
   nameserver.  However, it MAY NOT assume that the connection is
   properly pinned unless there is a DS record available for the domain
   it is currently resolving.

6.3.  Stub resolver changes

   This specification defines no changes to stub resolvers.

6.4.  Zone validator changes

   This section covers both the 'online' type of zone validator, such as
   Zonemaster, and the 'offline full zone' type, such as "validns" and
   "dnssec-verify".

   Checks for child DNSKEY records based on parent DS records
   algorithms, and checks for zone RRSIG algorithms based on DNSKEY
   algorithms, MUST not be applied to algorithm TBD.  [NOTE: rephrase
   this in terms of the Zone Signing column at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers/dns-sec-alg-
   numbers.xhtml (https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers/
   dns-sec-alg-numbers.xhtml) ?]

   DNSKEY validity checks MAY verify correct DER syntax in DNSKEY Public
   Key content when algorithm is TBD.

6.5.  Domain registry changes

   Any pre-delegation or periodic checks by registries should honor the
   Zone validator changes from the previous section.

   This specification trusts that appearance of TBD in
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers/dns-sec-alg-
   numbers.xhtml (https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers/
   dns-sec-alg-numbers.xhtml) will eventually lead registries to accept
   DS/(C)DNSKEY submissions for algorithm TBD.

   Registries that limit the total number of DS records for a delegation
   SHOULD consider having a separate limit for algorithm TBD DS records,
   as their management is separate from actual DNSSEC key management.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a way to convey, authoritatively, that
   resolvers must use DoT to do their queries to the name servers for a
   certain zone.  By doing so, that exchange gains confidentiality, data
   integrity, peer entity authentication.

8.  Implementation Status

   [RFC Editor: please remove this section before publication]

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   document, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC6982].  The
   description of implementations in this section is intended to assist
   the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
   Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here
   does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has
   been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied
   by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not be
   construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to RFC 6982, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

8.1.  PoC

   Some Proof of Concept code showing the generation of the (C)DNSKEY,
   and the subsequent hashing by a client (which should match one of the
   DS records with algo TBD), in Python and Go, is available at
   https://github.com/PowerDNS/parent-signals-dot/tree/master/poc
   (https://github.com/PowerDNS/parent-signals-dot/tree/master/poc)

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the IANA registry "DNS Security Algorithm
   Numbers" at https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers/dns-
   sec-alg-numbers.xhtml (https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-
   numbers/dns-sec-alg-numbers.xhtml)

   The following entries have been added to the registry:
