          Abstract

          This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
          Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
          protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, it
          defines objects for managing IEEE 802.3 10 and 100 Mb/second
          baseband repeaters based on IEEE Std 802.3 Section 30, "10 &
          100 Mb/s Management," October 26, 1995.

          This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
          community.


          1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

          The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of several
          major components.  They include:

          o    RFC 1902 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
               describing and naming objects for the purpose of
               management.

          o    STD 17, RFC 1213 defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
               objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

          o    RFC 1905 which defines the protocol used for network
               access to managed objects.

          The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
          purpose of experimentation and evaluation.


          1.1.  Object Definitions

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
          One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object
          type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively
          assigned name.  The object type together with an object
          instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation

          of the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual
          string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.

          Internet Draft        802.3 Repeater MIB      14 February 1996


          2.  Overview

          Instances of the object types defined in this memo represent
          attributes of an IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet-like) repeater, as
          defined by Section 9, "Repeater Unit for 10 Mb/s Baseband
          Networks" in the IEEE 802.3/ISO 8802-3 CSMA/CD standard [1],
          and Section 27, "Repeater for 100 Mb/s Baseband Networks" in
          the IEEE Standard 802.3u-1995 [2].

          These Repeater MIB objects may be used to manage non-standard
          repeater-like devices, but defining objects to describe
          implementation-specific properties of non-standard repeater-
          like devices is outside the scope of this memo.

          The definitions presented here are based on Section 30.4,
          "Layer Management for 10 and 100 Mb/s Baseband Repeaters" and
          Annex 30A, "GDMO Specificataions for 802.3 managed objects" of
          [3].

          Implementors of these MIB objects should note that [3]
          explicitly describes when, where, and how various repeater
          attributes are measured.  The IEEE document also describes the
          effects of repeater actions that may be invoked by
          manipulating instances of the MIB objects defined here.

          The counters in this document are defined to be the same as
          those counters in [3], with the intention that the same
          instrumentation can be used to implement both the IEEE and
          IETF management standards.

          2.1.  Structure of the MIB

          Objects in this MIB are arranged into MIB groups.  Each MIB
          group is organized as a set of related objects.

          2.1.1.  The Basic Group Definitions

          This group contains the objects which are applicable to all
          repeaters.  It contains status, parameter and control objects
          for each repeater within the managed system, for the port
          groups within the system, and for the individual ports

          themselves.

          2.1.2.  The Monitor Group Definitions

          This group contains monitoring statistics for each repeater
          within the system and for individual ports.

          2.1.3.  The Address Tracking Group Definitions

          This group contains objects for tracking the MAC addresses of
          the DTEs attached to the ports within the system.

          2.1.4.  The Top N Group Definitions

          This group contains objects for tracking the ports with the
          most activity within the system or within particular
          repeaters.

          2.2.  Relationship to Other MIBs

          2.2.1.  Relationship to RFC 1516

          This MIB is intended as a superset of that defined by RFC
          1516, which will go to historic status.  This MIB includes all
          of the objects contained in that MIB, plus some additional
          ones, mainly for support for multiple repeaters and for
          100BASE-T management.  Certain objects have been deprecated;
          in particular, those scalar objects used for managing a single
          repeater are now of minimal use since they are duplicated in
          the rptrInfoTable and rptrMonitorTable definitions.

          2.2.2.  Relationship to MIB-II

          It is assumed that a repeater implementing this MIB will also
          implement (at least) the 'system' group defined in MIB-II [5].

          2.2.2.1.  Relationship to the 'system' group

          In MIB-II, the 'system' group is defined as being mandatory
          for all systems such that each managed entity contains one
          instance of each object in the 'system' group.  Thus, those
          objects apply to the entity even if the entity's sole

          Internet Draft        802.3 Repeater MIB      14 February 1996


          functionality is management of repeaters.

          2.2.2.2.  Relationship to the 'interfaces' group

          In MIB-II, the 'interfaces' group is defined as being
          mandatory for all systems and contains information on an
          entity's interfaces, where each interface is thought of as
          being attached to a 'subnetwork'.  (Note that this term is not
          to be confused with 'subnet' which refers to an addressing
          partitioning scheme used in the Internet suite of protocols.)

          This Repeater MIB uses the notion of ports on a repeater.  The
          concept of a MIB-II interface has NO specific relationship to
          a repeater's port.  Therefore, the 'interfaces' group applies
          only to the one (or more) network interfaces on which the
          entity managing the repeater sends and receives management
          protocol operations, and does not apply to the repeater's
          ports.

          This is consistent with the physical-layer nature of a
          repeater.  A repeater is a bitwise store-and-forward device.
          It recognizes activity and bits, but does not process incoming
          data based on any packet-related information (such as checksum
          or addresses).  A repeater has no MAC address, no MAC
          implementation, and does not pass packets up to higher-level
          protocol entities for processing.

          (When a network management entity is observing a repeater, it
          may appear as though the repeater is passing packets to a
          higher-level protocol entity.  However, this is only a means
          of implementing management, and this passing of management
          information is not part of the repeater functionality.)

              DESCRIPTION
                      "The rptrGroupCapacity is the number of groups
                      that can be contained within the repeater.  Within
                      each managed repeater, the groups are uniquely
                      numbered in the range from 1 to rptrGroupCapacity.

                      Some groups may not be present in the repeater, in
                      which case the actual number of groups present
                      will be less than rptrGroupCapacity.  The number
                      of groups present will never be greater than
                      rptrGroupCapacity.

                      Note:  In practice, this will generally be the
                      number of field-replaceable units (i.e., modules,
                      cards, or boards) that can fit in the physical
                      repeater enclosure, and the group numbers will
                      correspond to numbers marked on the physical

                      the SNMP response to be transmitted.  In any
                      event, the SNMP response must be transmitted.

                      the repeater but without affecting management
                      information about the repeater.  c) The test does

                      port.  A disabled port neither transmits nor
                      receives.  Once disabled, a port must be
                      explicitly enabled to restore operation.  A port
                      which is disabled when power is lost or when a
                      reset is exerted shall remain disabled when normal
                      operation resumes.

                      The admin status takes precedence over auto-
                      partition and functionally operates between the
                      auto-partition mechanism and the AUI/PMA.

                      Setting this object to enabled(1) enables the port
                      and exerts a BEGIN on the port's auto-partition
                      state machine.

                      (In effect, when a port is disabled, the value of
                      rptrPortAutoPartitionState for that port is frozen
                      until the port is next enabled.  When the port
                      becomes enabled, the rptrPortAutoPartitionState

                      transition to the START state of Fig 9-2 in
                      section 9 [IEEE 802.3 Std] for a 10Mb/s repeater,
                      and to the START state of Fig 27-2 in section 27
                      of that standard for a 100Mb/s repeater.

                      Setting this object to noReset(1) has no effect.
                      The agent will always return the value noReset(1)
                      when this object is read.

                      After receiving a request to set this variable to
                      reset(2), the agent is allowed to delay the reset
                      for a short period.  For example, the implementor
                      may choose to delay the reset long enough to allow
                      the SNMP response to be transmitted.  In any
                      event, the SNMP response must be transmitted.

                      This action does not reset the management counters
                      defined in this document nor does it affect the
                      portAdminStatus parameters.  Included in this
                      action is the execution of a disruptive Self-Test
                      with the following characteristics:  a) The nature
                      of the tests is not specified.  b) The test resets
                      the repeater but without affecting management
                      information about the repeater.  c) The test does
                      not inject packets onto any segment.  d) Packets
                      received during the test may or may not be
                      transferred.  e) The test does not interfere with
                      management functions.

                      After performing this self-test, the agent will
                      update the repeater health information (including
                      rptrInfoOperStatus), and send a rptrInfoHealth trap."

                      not specified.  b) The test does not change the
                      state of the repeater or management information
                      about the repeater.  c) The test does not inject
                      packets onto any segment.  d) The test does not
                      prevent the relay of any packets.  e) The test
                      does not interfere with management functions.

                      Note that this definition allows returning an
                      'okay' result after doing a trivial test.

                      Setting this object to noSelfTest(1) has no

                          rptrMonitorPortDataRateMismatches.

                      This counter is redundant in the sense that it is
                      the summation of information already available
                      through other objects.  However, it is included
                      specifically because the regular retrieval of this
                      object as a means of tracking the health of a port
                      provides a considerable optimization of network
                      management traffic over the otherwise necessary
                      retrieval of the summed counters.

                      Note that rptrMonitorPortRunts is not included
                      in this total; this is because runts usually
                      indicate collision fragments, a normal network
                      event.

                      [Editor's note:  This sum does not include the
                      value of the rptrMonitorPortSymbolErrors object.
                      Perhaps we should deprecate it and define a new
                      PortTotalErrors object which does.  However, we
                      may need to address the rollover issue in that

                      "In a system containing multiple managed repeaters,

                      related to the operational status of a repeater.
                      It is sent either when the value of rptrInfoOperStatus
                      changes, or upon completion of a non-disruptive test.

                      The agent must throttle the generation of
                      consecutive rptrInfoHealth notifications for
                      the same repeater so that there is at least
                      a five-second gap between notifications of this type.
                      When notifications are throttled, they are dropped,
                      not queued for sending at a future time.  (Note

                      "In a system containing multiple managed
                      repeaters, the rptrInfoResetEvent notification
                      conveys information related to the operational
                      status of a repeater. This notification is sent
                      on completion of a repeater reset action.  A
                      repeater reset action is defined as a transition
                      to the START state of Fig 9-2 in section 9 of
                      [IEEE 802.3 Std], when triggered by a management
                      command (e.g., an SNMP Set on the rptrInfoReset
                      object).

                      The agent must throttle the generation of
                      consecutive rptrInfoResetEvent notifications for
                      a single repeater so that there is at least
                      a five-second gap between notifications of
                      this type.  When notifications are throttled,
                      they are dropped, not queued for sending at
                      a future time.  (Note that 'generating' a
                      notification means sending to all configured
                      recipients.)

                      The rptrInfoResetEvent trap is not sent when the
                      agent restarts and sends an SNMP coldStart or
                      warmStart trap.  However, it is recommended that
                      a repeater agent send the rptrInfoOperStatus
                      object as an optional object with its coldStart
                      and warmStart trap PDUs."
