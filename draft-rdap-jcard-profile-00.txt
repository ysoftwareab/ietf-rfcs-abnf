                      draft-rdap-jcard-profile-00

Abstract

   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) is used by Regional
   Internet Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name Registries (DNRs) to
   provide access to their resource registration information.  RDAP uses
   jCard to convey information about individuals and other entities: for
   example, for the technical contact for a domain name.  In practice,
   server operators are only using a small subset of jCard's
   functionality, so in an effort to simplify the requirements on the
   client side, this document defines a jCard profile for use with RDAP.

1.  Introduction

   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) [RFC7480] is used by
   Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name Registries (DNRs)
   to provide access to their resource registration information.  RDAP
   uses jCard ([RFC7095]) to convey information about individuals and
   other entities (e.g.  organisations and groups).  jCard is in turn a
   way of representing vCard ([RFC6350]) information in JSON.

   The core vCard specification defines 36 properties, 11 parameters, 12
   data types, and 31 parameter values.  More of each are defined in
   subsequent specifications (see the IANA vCard Elements registry).
   Due to the lack of supporting libraries for jCard, RDAP client
   developers often have to implement jCard support themselves, and
   handling the entire specification is a substantial burden.

   This document defines a jCard profile for use with RDAP that will
   reduce the implementation complexity for client developers.  The
   profile is primarily based on response data from the implementations
   that are currently included in the IANA RDAP bootstrap files.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft             RDAP jCard Profile                  July 2019


2.  Profile Definition

   The following properties may be used in jCards included in RDAP
   responses:

      kind;

      fn;

      n;

      adr;

      tel;

      email;

      lang;

      geo;

      title;

      role;

      org;

      version; and

      contact-uri.

   Each jCard MUST contain a "kind" property.  The value of that
   property MUST be "individual", "group", or "org".

   A "geo" property MUST have a type of "uri".  A "tel" property MUST
   have a type of "uri" or "text".  A "lang" property MUST have a type
   of "language-tag".  A "contact-uri" property MUST have a type of
   "uri".  All other properties MUST have a type of "text".

   An "adr" property MUST include a "label" parameter, containing the
   content of the delivery address as a single string.

   Properties may include "language", "altid", and "pref" parameters.

   "email", "org" and "adr" properties may include a "type" parameter.
   The "type" parameter values that may be used are "work" and "home".

   A "tel" property may include a "type" parameter.  The "type"
   parameter values that may be used are those defined in [RFC6350].

   An "adr" property may include a "cc" parameter.  This parameter may
   be set even when the "country name" component of the property's value
   is not set.

   Properties, types, and parameters not expressly permitted by way of
   this profile MUST NOT be used.

3.  Operational Considerations

   An RDAP client that encounters a jCard that is not in conformance
   with this specification SHOULD treat the jCard as if any non-
   conforming properties, parameters, or types were not present.

   Various server implementations are currently using the non-standard
   "ISO-3166-1-alpha-2" property for the ISO-3166-1 alpha 2 country code
   of the country from the "adr" property in the jCard.  This behaviour
   appears to be based on guidance from section 1.4.1 of ICANN's current
   RDAP response profile ([ICANN-RDAP-PROFILE]).  However, that section
   states that it only applies when the "ISO-3166-1-alpha-2" property
   "has been published in the vCardProperties registry defined in
   Section 10.3.1 of RFC 6350", and that property has not yet been
   published in that way.

   Various server implementations are currently setting the "country
   name" component of the "adr" property to be the ISO-3166-1 alpha 2
   country code of the country.  This behaviour appears to be based on
   guidance from section 1.4.2 of ICANN's current RDAP response profile
   ([ICANN-RDAP-PROFILE]).  The "cc" parameter approach to this problem,
   defined in [RFC8605], is preferred in this profile.
