<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Disruptions in end-to-end path connectivity which last longer
            than one retransmission timeout cause suboptimal TCP performance.
            The reason for the performance degradation is that TCP interprets
            segment loss induced by connectivity disruptions as a sign of
            congestion, resulting in repeated backoffs of the retransmission
            timer. This leads in turn to a deferred detection of the
            re-establishment of the connection since TCP waits until the next
            retransmission timeout occurs before attempting the
            retransmission.
</p>
<p>This document describes how standard ICMP messages can be
            exploited to disambiguate true congestion loss from non-congestion
            loss caused by long connectivity disruptions. Moreover, a revert
            strategy of the retransmission timer is specified that enables a
            more prompt detection of whether the connectivity to a previously
            disconnected peer node has been restored or not. The specified
            algorithm is a TCP sender-only modification that effectively
            improves TCP performance in presence of connectivity disruptions.

Introduction</h3>

<p>Connectivity disruptions can occur in many different situations.
            The frequency of the connectivity disruptions depends thereby on
            the property of the end-to-end path between the communicating
            hosts. While connectivity disruptions can occur in traditional
            wired networks too, e.g., simply due to an unplugged network cable,
            the likelihood of occurrence is significantly higher in wireless
            (multi-hop) networks. Especially, end-host mobility, network
            topology changes and wireless interferences are crucial factors. In
            the case of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
            <a class='info' href='#RFC0793'>[RFC0793]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Transmission Control Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a>, the performance of the connection can
            exhibit a significant reduction compared to a permanently connected
            path <a class='info' href='#SESB05'>[SESB05]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schuetz, S., Eggert, L., Schmid, S., and M. Brunner, &ldquo;Protocol enhancements for intermittently connected                     hosts,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. This is because TCP, which was
            originally designed to operate in fixed and wired networks,
            generally assumes that the end-to-end path connectivity is
            relatively stable over the connection's lifetime.
</p>
<p>According to Schuetz et. al.
            <a class='info' href='#I-D.schuetz-tcpm-tcp-rlci'>[I&#8209;D.schuetz&#8209;tcpm&#8209;tcp&#8209;rlci]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schuetz, S., Koutsianas, N., Eggert, L., Eddy, W., Swami, Y., and K. Le, &ldquo;TCP Response to Lower-Layer Connectivity-Change Indications,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> connectivity disruptions
            can be classified into two groups: "short" and "long" connectivity
            disruptions.  A connectivity disruption is short if connectivity
            returns before the retransmission timeout (RTO) fires for the first
            time. In this case, TCP recovers lost data segments through Fast
            Retransmit and lost acknowledgments (ACK) through successfully
            delivered later ACKs.  Connectivity disruptions are declared as
            "long" for a given TCP connection, if the RTO fires at least once
            before connectivity returns. Whether or not path characteristics
            like the round trip time (RTT) or the available bandwidth have
            changed when the connectivity returns after a disruption is another
            important aspect for TCP's retransmission scheme
            <a class='info' href='#I-D.schuetz-tcpm-tcp-rlci'>[I&#8209;D.schuetz&#8209;tcpm&#8209;tcp&#8209;rlci]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schuetz, S., Koutsianas, N., Eggert, L., Eddy, W., Swami, Y., and K. Le, &ldquo;TCP Response to Lower-Layer Connectivity-Change Indications,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>This document will focus on TCP's behavior in face of long
            connectivity disruptions in the time "before" connectivity is
            restored. In particular this memo does not describe any additional
            modification to detect if the path characteristics remain unchanged
            in order to improve TCP's behavior "after" connectivity is restored.
            Therefore, TCP's congestion control mechanisms
            <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc2581bis'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;tcpm&#8209;rfc2581bis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Allman, M., Paxson, V., and E. Blanton, &ldquo;TCP Congestion Control,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> will be unchanged.
</p>
<p>When a long connectivity disruption occurs on a TCP connection,
            the TCP sender stops receiving acknowledgments. After the
            retransmission timer expires, the TCP sender enters the
            timeout-based loss recovery and declares the oldest outstanding
            segment (SND.UNA) as lost. Since TCP tightly couples reliability
            and congestion control, the retransmission of SND.UNA is triggered
            together with the reduction of sending rate, which is based on the
            assumption that loss is indication of congestion
            <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc2581bis'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;tcpm&#8209;rfc2581bis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Allman, M., Paxson, V., and E. Blanton, &ldquo;TCP Congestion Control,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. As long as the
            connectivity disruption persists, TCP will repeat the procedure
            until the oldest outstanding segment is successfully acknowledged,
            or the connection times out. TCP implementations that follow the
            recommended RTO management of RFC&nbsp;2988
            <a class='info' href='#RFC2988'>[RFC2988]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Paxson, V. and M. Allman, &ldquo;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> double the RTO value after each
            retransmission attempt. However, the RTO growth may be bounded by
            an upper limit, the maximum RTO, which is at least 60s, but may be
            longer: Linux for example uses 120s. If the connectivity is
            restored between two retransmission attempts, TCP still has to wait
            until the RTO expires before resuming transmission, since it simply
            does not have any means to know when the connectivity is
            re-established.  Therefore, depending on when connectivity becomes
            available again, this can waste up to maximum RTO of possible
            transmission time.
</p>
<p>This retransmission behavior is not efficient, especially in
            scenarios or networks like wireless (multi-hop) networks where
            connectivity disruptions are frequent. In the ideal case, TCP would
            attempt a retransmission as soon as connectivity to its peer is
            re-established.  This document describes how the standard Internet
            Control Message Protocol (ICMP) can be exploited to identify
            non-congestion loss caused by connectivity disruptions. An revert
            strategy of the retransmission timer is specified that enables, due
            to higher-frequency retransmissions, a prompt detection of whether
            connectivity to a previously disconnected peer node has been
            restored. The specified scheme is a TCP sender-only modification,
            i.e., neither intermediate routers nor the TCP receiver have to be
            modified.  Furthermore, in the case the network allows, i.e., no
            congestion is present, the proposed algorithm approaches the ideal
            behavior.

Connectivity Disruption Indication</h3>

<p>As long as the queue of a intermediate router experiencing a link outage is deep
            enough, i.e., it can buffer all incoming packets, a connectivity
            disruption will only cause variation in delay which is handled well by
            contemporary TCP implementations with the help of Eifel
            <a class='info' href='#RFC3522'>[RFC3522]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ludwig, R. and M. Meyer, &ldquo;The Eifel Detection Algorithm for TCP,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> or forward RTO (F-RTO)
            <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc4138bis'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;tcpm&#8209;rfc4138bis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sarolahti, P., Kojo, M., Yamamoto, K., and M. Hata, &ldquo;Forward RTO-Recovery (F-RTO): An Algorithm for Detecting Spurious  Retransmission Timeouts with TCP,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. However, if the link outage
            lasts too long, the router experiencing the link outage is forced to
            drop packets and finally to discard the according route. Means to detect
            such link outages comprise reacting on failed address resolution protocol
            (ARP) <a class='info' href='#RFC0826'>[RFC0826]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Plummer, D., &ldquo;Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol: Or converting network protocol addresses to 48.bit Ethernet address for transmission on Ethernet hardware,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1982.</span><span>)</span></a> queries, unsuccessful link sensing, and
            the like. However, this is solely in the responsibility of the respective
            router.

<p>The removal of the route usually goes along with a notification to
            the corresponding TCP sender about the dropped packets via ICMP
            destination unreachable messages of code 0 (net unreachable) or code 1
            (host unreachable) <a class='info' href='#RFC1812'>[RFC1812]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baker, F., &ldquo;Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1995.</span><span>)</span></a>. Therefore, since ICMP
            destination unreachable messages of these codes provide evidence that
            packets were dropped due to a link outage, they can be used
            by a TCP as an indication for a connectivity disruption.
</p>
<p>Note that there are also other ICMP destination unreachable messages
            with different codes. Some of them are candidates for connectivity
            disruption indications too, but need further investigation. For example
            ICMP destination unreachable messages with code 5 (source route failed),
            code 11 (net unreachable for TOS), or code 12 (host unreachable for TOS)
            <a class='info' href='#RFC1812'>[RFC1812]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baker, F., &ldquo;Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1995.</span><span>)</span></a>. On the other side codes that flag hard errors
            are of no use for the proposed scheme, since
            TCP should abort the connection when those are received <a class='info' href='#RFC1122'>[RFC1122]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, R., &ldquo;Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1989.</span><span>)</span></a>. In the
            following, the term "ICMP unreachable message" is used as synonym for
            ICMP destination unreachable messages of code 0 or code 1.
</p>
<p>The accurate interpretation of ICMP unreachable messages as an
            connectivity disruption indication is complicated by the following two
            peculiarities of ICMP messages. Firstly, they do not necessarily operate
            on the same timescale as the packets, i.e., in the given case TCP segments,
            which elicited them. When a router drops a packet due to a missing route
            it will not necessarily send an ICMP unreachable message immediately,
            but rather queues it for later delivery. Secondly, ICMP messages are
            subject to rate limiting, e.g., when a router drops a whole window of
            data due to a link outage, it will hardly send as many ICMP unreachable
            messages as it dropped TCP segments. Depending on the load of the router
            it may even send no ICMP unreachable messages at all. Both peculiarities
            originate from <a class='info' href='#RFC1812'>[RFC1812]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baker, F., &ldquo;Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1995.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, according to <a class='info' href='#RFC0792'>[RFC0792]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Internet Control Message Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a> ICMP unreachable
            messages are obliged to contain in their body the Internet Protocol
            (IP) header <a class='info' href='#RFC0791'>[RFC0791]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Internet Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a> of the datagram eliciting the ICMP
            unreachable messages plus the first 64 bits of the payload of that
            datagram. Hence, in case of TCP both port numbers and the sequence number
            are included. This allows the originating TCP to identify the connection
            which an ICMP unreachable message is reporting an error about. Moreover,
            it allows the originating TCP to identify which segment of the respective
            connection triggered the ICMP unreachable message, provided that there
            are not several segments in flight with the same sequence number. This
            may very well be the case when TCP is recovering lost segments
            (see <a class='info' href='#alg_discuss'>Section&nbsp;4.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Discussion</span><span>)</span></a>).
</p>
<p>A connectivity disruption
            indication in form of an ICMP unreachable message associated with
            a presumably lost TCP segment provides strong evidence that the
            segment was not dropped due to congestion but instead was
            successful delivered to the temporary end-point of the employed
            path, i.e., the reporting router. It therefore did not witness any
            congestion at least on that very part of the path which was
            traveled by both, the TCP segment eliciting the ICMP unreachable
            message as well as the ICMP unreachable message itself.

            The complete algorithm is specified in <a class='info' href='#alg'>Section&nbsp;4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>The Algorithm</span><span>)</span></a>. In
            <a class='info' href='#alg_discuss'>Section&nbsp;4.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Discussion</span><span>)</span></a> the algorithm is discussed in detail.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h3>4.1.&nbsp;
Basic Idea</h3>

<p>The goal of the algorithm is the prompt detection when the
                connectivity to a previously disconnected peer node has been restored
                after a long connectivity disruption while retaining appropriate
                behavior in case of congestion. The proposed algorithm exploits
                standard ICMP unreachable messages to increase the TCP's retransmission frequency
                during timeout-based loss recovery by undoing a backoff of the retransmission timer
                whenever an ICMP unreachable message reports on a presumably
                lost retransmission.
</p>
<p>This approach has the advantage of appropriately reducing the
                probing rate in case of congestion. If either the
                (re-)transmission itself, or the corresponding ICMP message is
                dropped the conventional backoff is performed and not
                undone, effectively halving the probing rate.

The Algorithm</h3>

<p>A TCP sender using RFC&nbsp;2988 <a class='info' href='#RFC2988'>[RFC2988]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Paxson, V. and M. Allman, &ldquo;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> to
                compute TCP's retransmission timer MAY employ the following
                scheme to avoid over-conservative backoffs of the retransmission
                timer in case of long connectivity disruptions. If a TCP
                sender does implement the scheme, the following steps MUST be
                taken, but only upon initiation of a timeout-based loss
                recovery, i.e., upon the first timeout of the oldest outstanding
                segment (SND.UNA). The algorithm MUST NOT be re-initiated after
                a timeout-based loss recovery has already been started but not
                completed. In particular, it must not be re-initiated upon
                subsequent timeouts for the same segment.
</p>
<p>A TCP sender that does not employ RFC&nbsp;2988
                <a class='info' href='#RFC2988'>[RFC2988]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Paxson, V. and M. Allman, &ldquo;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> to compute TCP's retransmission timer
                SHOULD NOT use the scheme. We envision that the scheme could be
                easily adapted to other algorithms than RFC&nbsp;2988. However,
                we leave this as future work.
</p>
<p>The scheme specified in this document uses the "Backoff_cnt"
                variable, whose initial value is zero. The variable is used to

                and initiates the algorithm (step 1). It adjusts the slow start
                threshold (ssthresh), sets the congestion window (CWND) to one
                segment, back offs the retransmission timer and retransmits
                the first unacknowledged segment (step R)
                <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc2581bis'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;tcpm&#8209;rfc2581bis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Allman, M., Paxson, V., and E. Blanton, &ldquo;TCP Congestion Control,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>

</p>
<p>In case the RTO expires again (step 3a) a TCP will
                repeat the retransmission of the first unacknowledged segment
                and provided that the maximum RTO is not yet reached back off
                the RTO once more (step R).
</p>
<p>If the first received packet after the retransmission(s) is
                an acceptable ACK (step 3b), a TCP will proceed as normal, i.e.,
                slow start the connection and terminate the algorithm (step A).
                Later ICMP unreachable messages from the just terminated
                timeout-based loss recovery are of no use and therefore ignored
                since the ACK clock is already restarting due to the successful
                retransmission.
</p>
<p>On the other side if the first received packet after the
                retransmission(s) is an ICMP unreachable message (step 3c), a
                TCP SHOULD if allowed (step 4) undo one backoff for each ICMP
                unreachable message reporting an error on a retransmission. To
                decide if an ICMP unreachable message reports on a
                retransmission, the sequence number therein is exploited
                (step 5, step 6).
</p>
<p>Upon receipt of an ICMP unreachable message which
                legitimately undoes one backoff there is the possibility that
                this new RTO has expired already (step 7). Then, a TCP SHOULD
                retransmit immediately, i.e., an ICMP message clocked
                retransmission. In case the new RTO has not expired yet, TCP
                MUST wait accordingly.

Discussion</h3>

<p>It is important to note that the proposed algorithm only
                reacts to connectivity disruption indications in form of ICMP
                destination unreachable messages during the phase of RTO
                induced loss recovery. That is, TCP's behavior is not altered
                when no ICMP destination unreachable messages are received, or
                the retransmission timer of the TCP sender did not yet expire
                since the last successfully received ACK. Thereby the algorithm
                is by definition only triggered in the case of long
                connectivity disruptions.
</p>
<p>Only such ICMP unreachable messages which are reporting on
                the sequence number of the retransmission (SND.UNA) are
                evaluated by the proposed algorithm. All other ICMP unreachable
                messages are ignored. If an ICMP unreachable message arrives
                for a retransmission it provides evidence that neither the
                retransmission nor the corresponding ICMP unreachable message
                itself did experience any congestion. In other words, it has
                been proved that the retransmission was not lost due to
                congestion, but due to a connectivity disruption instead.
</p>
<p>One could argue, that if an ICMP destination unreachable
                message arrives for an RTO induced retransmission, the RTO
                should be reset, and the next retransmission send out
                immediately similar to what is done when an ACK arrives after
                an RTO induced recovery phase. This would allow for a much
                higher probing frequency based on the round trip time of the
                router where the connectivity is disrupted. However, we
                consider our proposed scheme a good trade off between
                conservative behavior and a fast detection of connectivity
                re-establishment.
</p>
<p>Off course there is an ambiguity on which (re-)transmission
                an ICMP unreachable message reports. However, for our purposes
                it is not considered to be problem, because the assumption that
                such an ICMP message provides evidence that one link loss was
                wrongly considered as a congestion loss, still holds. There is
                also the option to make use of the timestamps option to obtain
                a more strict mapping between segments and ICMP messages (see
                <a class='info' href='#alg_discuss'>Section&nbsp;4.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Discussion</span><span>)</span></a>).
</p>
<p>Besides the ambiguity if the first unacknowledged sequence
                number refers to the original transmission or to any of the
                retransmissions, there is another source of ambiguity about the
                sequence numbers contained in the ICMP unreachable messages.
                For high bandwidth paths like modern gigabit links the sequence
                space may wrap rather quickly, thereby allowing the possibility
                that a late ICMP unreachable message reporting on an old error
                may coincidentally fit as input in the scheme explained above.
                As a result, the scheme would wrongly undo one backoff. Chances
                for this to happen are minuscule, since a particular ICMP
                message would need to contain the exact sequence number of
                SND.UNA, while at the same TCP is coincidentally in
                timeout-based loss recovery.  Moreover, as the scheme is
                tailored most conservatively no threat to the network from this
                issues may arise.
</p>
<p>Finally, the scheme explicitly does not call for a
                differentiation of ICMP unreachable messages originating from
                different routers, as the evidence of no congestion still holds
                even if the reporting router changed.
</p>
<p>Another exploitation of ICMP unreachable messages in the
                context of TCP congestion control might seem appropriate in
                case the ICMP unreachable message is received while TCP is in
                steady-state and the message refers to a segment from within
                the current window of data.  As the RTT up to the router which
                generates the ICMP unreachable message is likely to be
                substantially shorter than the overall RTT to the destination,
                the ICMP unreachable message may very well reach the
                originating TCP while it is transmitting the current window of
                data. In case the remaining window is large, it might seem
                appropriate to refrain from transmitting the remaining window
                as there is timely evidence that it will only trigger further
                ICMP unreachable messages at the very router. Although this
                might seem appropriate from a wastage perspective, it may be
                counterproductive from a security perspective since ICMP
                message are easy to spoof, thereby allowing an easy attack to
                the TCP by simply forging such ICMP messages.
</p>
<p>An additional consideration is the following: in the presence
                of multi-path routing even the receipt of a legitimate ICMP
                unreachable message cannot be exploited accurately because
                there is the option that only one of the multiple paths to the
                destination is suffering from a connectivity disruption which
                causes ICMP unreachable messages to be sent. Then however,
                there is the possibility that the path along which the
                connectivity disruption occurred contributed considerably to
                the overall bandwidth, such that a congestion response is very
                well reasonable. However, this is not necessarily the case.
                Therefore, a TCP has no means except for its inherent
                congestion control to decide on this matter. All in all, it
                seems that for a connection in steady-state, i.e., not in RTO
                induced recovery, reacting on ICMP unreachable messages in
                regard to congestion control is not appropriate. For the case
                of RTO-based retransmissions, however, there is a reasonable
                congestion response, which is skipping further backoffs of the
                RTO because there is no congestion indication - as described
                above.

<p>In literature there are several methods that address TCP's
            problems in the presence of connectivity disruptions. Some of them
            try to improve TCP's performance by modifying lower layers. For
            example <a class='info' href='#SM03'>[SM03]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Scott, J. and G. Mapp, &ldquo;Link layer-based TCP optimisation for disconnecting                     networks,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> introduces a "smart link layer" that
            buffers one segment for each ongoing connection and replaying these
            segments on connectivity re-establishment. This approach has a
            serious drawback: previously stateless intermediate routers have
            to be modified in order to inspect TCP headers, to track the
            end-to-end connection and to provide additional buffer space. These
            lead all in all to an additional need of memory and processing
            power.
</p>
<p>On the other hand stateless link layer schemes, like proposed in
            <a class='info' href='#RFC3819'>[RFC3819]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Karn, P., Bormann, C., Fairhurst, G., Grossman, D., Ludwig, R., Mahdavi, J., Montenegro, G., Touch, J., and L. Wood, &ldquo;Advice for Internet Subnetwork Designers,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>, which unconditionally buffer some small
            number of packets may have another problem: if a packet is buffered
            longer than the maximum segment lifetime (MSL) of 2 min
            <a class='info' href='#RFC0793'>[RFC0793]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Transmission Control Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a>, i.e., the disconnection lasts longer than
            MSL, TCP's assumption that such segments will never be received
            will no longer be true, violating TCP's semantics
            <a class='info' href='#I-D.eggert-tcpm-tcp-retransmit-now'>[I&#8209;D.eggert&#8209;tcpm&#8209;tcp&#8209;retransmit&#8209;now]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Eggert, L., &ldquo;TCP Extensions for Immediate Retransmissions,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Other approaches like TCP-F <a class='info' href='#CRVP01'>[CRVP01]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Chandran, K., Raghunathan, S., Venkatesan, S., and R. Prakash, &ldquo;A feedback-based scheme for improving TCP performance                     in ad hoc wireless networks,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> or the
            Explicit Link Failure Notification (ELFN) <a class='info' href='#HV02'>[HV02]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Holland, G. and N. Vaidya, &ldquo;Analysis of TCP performance over mobile ad hoc                     networks,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>
            inform the TCP sender about a disrupted path by special messages
            generated from intermediate routers. In case of a link failure they
            stop sending segments and freeze TCP's retransmission timers. TCP-F
            stays in this state and remains silent until either a "route
            establishment notification" is received or an internal timer
            expires. In contrast, ELFN periodically probes the network to detect
            connectivity re-establishment. Both proposals rely on changes to
            intermediate routers, whereas the scheme proposed in this document
            is a sender-only modification. Moreover, ELFN also does not consider
            congestion and may impose serious additional load on the network,
            depending on the probe interval.
</p>
<p>The authors of ATCP <a class='info' href='#LS01'>[LS01]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Liu, J. and S. Singh, &ldquo;ATCP: TCP for mobile ad hoc networks,&rdquo; 2001&nbsp;July.</span><span>)</span></a> propose enhancements
            to identify different types of packet loss by introducing a layer
            between TCP and IP. They utilize ICMP destination unreachable
            messages to set TCP's receiver advertised window to zero and thus
            forcing the TCP sender to perform zero window probing with a
            exponential backoff. ICMP destination unreachable messages, which
            arrive during this probing period, are ignored. This approach is
            nearly orthogonal to this document, which exploits ICMP messages to
            undo a RTO backoff, when TCP is already probing. In principle
            both mechanisms could be combined, however, due to security
            considerations it does not seem appropriate to adopt ATCP's
            reaction as discussed in <a class='info' href='#alg_discuss'>Section&nbsp;4.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Discussion</span><span>)</span></a>.

Le, &ldquo;TCP Response to Lower-Layer Connectivity-Change Indications,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> a set of TCP extensions
            that improve TCP's behavior when transmitting over paths whose
            characteristics can change on short time-scales. Their proposed
            extensions modify the local behavior of TCP and introduce a new TCP
            option to signal locally received connectivity-change indications
            (CCIs) to remote peers. Upon reception of a CCI, they re-probe the
            path characteristics either by performing a speculative
            retransmission or by sending a single segment of new data, depending
            on whether the connection is currently stalled in exponential
            backoff or transmitting in steady-state, respectively. The authors
            focus on specifying TCP response mechanisms, nevertheless
            underlying layers would have to be modified to explicitly send CCIs
            to make these immediate responses possible.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>The proposed algorithm is considered to be secure. For example an
            attacker cannot make a TCP modified with proposed scheme flood the
            network just by sending forged ICMP unreachable messages to attempt
            to maliciously shorten the retransmission timer.  An attacker would
            need to guess the correct sequence number of the current
            retransmission, which seems very unlikely. Even in case of an
            omniscient attacker, the impact on network load would be low, since
            the retransmission frequency is limited by the RTO value which was
            computed before TCP has entered the timeout-based loss recovery.
            (The highest probing frequency is expected to be even lower than
            once per minimum RTO, that is 1s as specified by
            <a class='info' href='#RFC2988'>[RFC2988]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Paxson, V. and M. Allman, &ldquo;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>.)

<li>The document was restructured in Section

                        <a class='info' href='#cdi'>3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Connectivity Disruption Indication</span><span>)</span></a> for easier
                        reading. The motivation for the algorithm is changed
                        according TCP's problem to disambiguate congestion from
                        non-congestion loss.
</li>
<li>Added <a class='info' href='#alg_idea'>Section&nbsp;4.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Basic Idea</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>The algorithm in <a class='info' href='#alg'>Section&nbsp;4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>The Algorithm</span><span>)</span></a> was
                        restructured and simplified:
                            
<ul class="text">
<li>The special case of the first received ICMP

                                removed.
</li>
<li>The "Backoff_cnt" variable was introduced so
                                it is no longer possible to perform more reverts
                                than backoffs.
