     Using DNAME in the root for the delegation of special-use TLDs
                     draft-bortzmeyer-dname-root-00

Abstract

   This documents asks IANA to add DNAME records in the DNS root for
   TLDs which are in the Special-Use Domain Names registry, in order to
   ensure they receive an appropriate reply (NXDOMAIN) and that the root
   is not too bothered by them.

   REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: there is no obvious place to discuss this
   document.  May be the IETF DNSOP (DNS Operations) group, through its
   mailing list (the author reads it).  Or may AS112 operators mailing
   lists?  The source of the document, as well as a list of open issues,
   is currently kept at Github [1].

1.  Introduction and background

   The DNS root receives a lot of requests for TLDs which do not exist.
   In the spirit of [RFC7534], it would be good if they could be
   redirected to a sink such as AS112, to save root's resources.  TODO
   references to one of the many DNS-OARC talks about these junk
   requests.

   Some of these names, and specially one of the biggest offenders,
   .local ([RFC6762]), are registered in the Special-Use Domain Names
   registry of [RFC6761].  They are obvious candidates for a delegation
   to the sink.

   It is proposed to use the new AS112, the one described by [RFC7535]
   to implement this sink.

   TODO requires discussion with AS112 people

1.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Rules

   Every TLD ([RFC7719], section 2) which is in the Special-Use Domain
   Names registry ([RFC6761]) SHOULD be delegated by IANA through a
   DNAME to empty.as112.arpa as described in [RFC7535] if and only if
   the registration of these TLD say that resolvers should not or must
   not look them up in the DNS.

   It is important to notice that this document does not define a policy
   to decide if a TLD should be delegated or not.  Instead, it relies on
   the existing Special-Use Domain Names registry and its rules.

   RFC-EDITOR: remove before publication.  As of today, with these
   rules, .local ([RFC6762]) or .onion ([RFC7686]) would be delegated
   but not .example (its registration in [RFC6761] does not define
   special handling for resolvers) or .home or .belkin (which generate a
   huge traffic at the root but are not in the Special-Use Domain Names
   registry.

3.  Benefits

   The main benefit is less load on the root and a better efficiency of
   the caches.

   TODO mention RFC 6303?

4.  Possible issues

   TODO support of DNAME (there is certainly a Geoff Huston survey of
   DNAMEs in the wild).

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested (TODO what is the appropriate wording?) to add a
   DNAME in the root for every TLD which fits the rules of Section 2.

   RFC-EDITOR: remove before publication.  There is currently no DNAME
   in the root.  It is expected that the creation of the first one will
   require a top-down, multi-stakeholder, long and complicated process
   with a lot of meetings, reports by consultants and design teams.

6.  Security Considerations

   TODO: leaks, privacy.  Copy from the AS112 RFC ?

   Thanks to Paul Hoffman to say that it may be a good idea and for Ted
   Lemon to give the final impulse, with his [I-D.tldr-sutld-ps].
