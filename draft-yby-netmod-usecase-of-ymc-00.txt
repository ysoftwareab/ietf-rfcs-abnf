1.  Introduction

   The Yang standards with version 1.0 RFC 6020 [RFC6020] and version
   1.1 RFC 7950 [RFC7950] define a domain- specific language for network
   data modeling.  By using Yang models, several network management
   protocols like NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040] are proposed.
   These protocols are deployed widely in network management systems
   (including network controllers in SDN).  The Yang-model-driven
   systems generally generate codes from yang models by using Yang
   compiler, and executes network operations on these model data.  A lot
   of Yang models are defined for the networks in different layers.  The
   combination of multiple Yang models form a complete network model
   under specific scenarios.

   A Yang model is composed of different statements.  According to the
   descriptions in Yang standards, these statements could be divided
   into module statement, submodule statement, typedef statement,
   container statement, leaf-list statement, list statement, choice
   statement, etc.  In order to manage the updates for Yang models in
   the equipment development, Yang standard introduces revision
   statement and augment statement to indicate the version and extension
   for a Yang model.  However, these statements could only handle the
   model management in an incremental updating way, but couldn't handle
   the mapping problem between two similar Yang models.  And with the
   widespread adoption of Yang, such a mapping problem occurs.

   Until now, many Yang models have been defined by different
   organizations, vendors, network operators, and foundations.  These
   existed Yang models are deployed in different scenarios.  However,
   these models don't coordinate with each other very well.  For a
   certain part, the authors usually define duplicated and conflicted
   models to make this part meet their own requirements.  And once the
   data conversion from one model to another is required, there is no
   such a solution defined.  In order to address this problem, Yang
   model conversion is introduced.  In reality, such a model conversion
   happens when:

   o  A vendor is required to provide different models for different
      customers (telecom operators, cloud computing companies, etc.) on
      the same equipment.

   o  A network operator needs to map all network models defined by all
      network equipment into its own complete network model.

   o  An organization needs to map its own models into the models
      defined by another organization.

   The conversion between two Yang models enables the concrete
   definition of model difference.  In all conversion use cases, such a
   definition enhances the conversion robustness.  Besides, it also make
   all gap between models evaluable.

2.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The usage limitation of Yang model conversion

   The model conversion MAY introduce information loss or information
   deviation while mapping the data from one model to another.
   Therefore, the conversion could not be applied when the gap between
   two models are non-negligible.  Usually, only the mapping between two
   models that define the same equipment component MAY succeeds.  Yang
   model conversion is not recommended if the mapping problem could be
   solved by simple augmentation, or other solutions without information
   loss or information deviation.

   In database, there MAY be only one model stored, and other model data
   are generated by Yang model conversion timely.  Some nodes defined in
   schema tree MAY be skipped after model conversion.  If the rpc
   service or notification service include these skipped nodes, these
   services are not available.
