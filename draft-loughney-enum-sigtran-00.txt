Abstract

This draft proposes to use ENUM resolution to support signaling
transport.  This draft outlines the resolution E.164 numbers by NAPTR in
DNS to a service location.  Considerations need to be made for
scalability, reliability and performance.

Internet Draft  Use of ENUM Services by SIGTRAN Protocols July 11, 2000


1 Introduction

This document proposes a new service, called 'sig' to enable ENUM
resolution of E.164 numbers for the purpose of signaling transport.  By
querying DNS for signaling transport options of a particular network
entity assigned a E.164 number, signaling transport protocols can locate
the network entity within an IP network.

1.1 Scope

This document introduces a new service into DNS.  How the network
entities are provisioned by operators and service providers is outside
of the scope of this document.  This document puts no requirements on
the signaling transport protocols themselves.

1.2 Terminology

     ENUM - Telephone Number Mapping

     GT - SS7 Global Title

     GTT - Global Title Translation

     IUA - ISDN Q.921-User Adaptation

     M2UA - MTP2 User Adaptation

     M3UA - MTP3 User Adaptation

     SIGTRAN - Signaling Transport

     SCTP - Stream Control Transport Protocol

     SRV RR - Service Resource Record

     SS7 - Signaling System No. 7

     SUA - SCCP User Adaptation

     UA - User Adaptation

     URI - Uniform Resource Identifier

1.3 Signaling Transport Overview

The Framework Architecture for Signaling Transport [RFC 2719] defines a
framework for transporting SS7 Application Protocols (SS7 AP) over IP.
Current solutions call for a transport protocol, SCTP [SCTP] as the
signaling bearer, with a number of User Adaptation layers [IUA] [M2UA]
[M3UA] [SUA].  The User Adaptation (UA) layer will carry an SS7 AP
between two IP nodes.  This UA may need to perform some address
translation (from an SS7 address to IP address) in order to setup a
signaling bearer between the IP endpoints.

2 Overview

Telecom services and networks are migrating to IP.  This introduces some
complications for address resolution, since upper layer protocols may
use SS7 addressing schemes, while using IP addresses for transport.

Internet Draft  Use of ENUM Services by SIGTRAN Protocols July 11, 2000


Certain Application Protocols may carry addressing to be used as the SS7
Global Titles, which will need to be resolved to URIs.

For Application Protocols that use E.164 numbering plans, we can define
a service so that ENUM can be used to retrieve the corresponding
Resource Record associated with the element.

>From there, the next step will involve using NAPTRs to find the service
location of the needed signaling protocol.

Finally, the last step is the sending of a "sig" related application
message using a specific protocol (e.g., TCP or SCTP) to the cellular
network element corresponding to the domain name in the Target field of
the retrieved SRV RR. This assumes a public IP network.

If the network elements always use E.164 numbers in the GT for the
subsequent messages, it may be worthwhile to add IP address / host name
as another option for the service entity as an enhancements to a SS7
Application Protocol, but that is outside of the scope of this document.

3 Formats

3.1 Using DNS for Storage of E.164 Numbers

The rules for storing an E.164 number in DNS are described in [E.164-
DNS].  A quick overview is:

Take a full E.164 number (including country & city codes), remove all
non-digit characters.  Insert a dot (i.e. - '.') between all the digits.
Reverse the order of the digits.  Append the .e164.arpa domain to the
end.  This is the DNS name of the E.164 number.

For example:
     +358-60-111-2222 becomes 2.2.2.2.1.1.1.0.6.8.5.3.e164.arpa.

This is the host name where the sig RRs can be found.

3.2 NAPTR RR Format

Following the format given in [NAPTR], were the DNS record is defined by
the statement:

;;       order pref flags serv regexp           replacement
IN NAPTR 100   10   ""    ""   "/urn:cid:.+@([^\.]+\.)(.*)$/\2/i" .

The service field should be filled in with "_sig+E2I" for support of the
sig service.

3.3 Lookup Format

If a client wants to discover the location of the server providing the
sig service, using a particular transport protocol (for example TCP,
SCTP) it should do a lookup of:

     _sig.x.x.x.e164.arpa

     where x.x.x is the processed E.164 number returned by step 1 on the
ENUM service.

4 Examples

This example shows how the 'sig' service could be used.  This is only an
example - any resemblance to any existing services or domains (living or
dead) is purely coincidental.

$ORIGIN     2.2.2.2.1.1.1.0.6.8.5.3.e164.arpa.
 IN NAPTR 10 5  "s" "sig._sua+E2I"   "" _sua1._sctp.nokia.com
 IN NAPTR 10 5  "s" "sig._sua+E2I"   "" _sua2._sctp.nokia.com
 IN NAPTR 10 10 "s" "sig._m3ua+E2I"  "" _m3ua._sctp.nokia.com
 IN NAPTR 10 10 "s" "sig._m2ua+E2I"  "" _m2ua._sctp.nokia.com

and then _sua1._sctp.nokia.com would return:

     ;;                             Pref Weight Port Target
     _sua1._sctp.nokia.com   IN SRV 0    0      1000 glc1.nokia.com
                             IN SRV 0    0      1000 glc2.nokia.com
                             IN SRV 0    0      1000 glc3.nokia.com

5 Security Considerations

As this service is built on top of DNS, the results from any query will
not be more secure than any other DNS query.  DNSSEC therefore, is
strongly recommended for securing and verifying zones.

6 IANA Considerations

The E2I service has not been standardized yet.  It has been suggested to
setup a IANA registry for NAPTR.

It may also be worthwhile to register the sig service with IANA.
