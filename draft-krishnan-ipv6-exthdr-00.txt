Abstract

   In IPv6,optional internet-layer information is encoded in separate
   headers that may be placed between the IPv6 header and the transport
   layer header.  There are a small number of such extension headers
   currently defined.  This document defines a format for defining new
   IPv6 extension headers.

Internet-Draft      Format for IPv6 extension headers          July 2006


1.  Introduction

   The base IPv6 standard defines extension headers as an expansion
   mechanism to carry optional internet layer information.  Extension
   headers, with the exception of the hop-by-hop options header, are not
   usually processed on intermediate nodes.  However, some intermediate
   nodes such as firewalls, may need to look at the transport layer
   header fields in order to make a decision to allow or deny the
   packet.  If new extension headers are defined and the intermediate
   node is not aware of them, the intermediate node cannot proceed
   further in the header chain since it does not know where the unknown
   header ends and the next header begins.  The main issue is that the
   extension header format is not standard and hence it is not possible
   to skip past the unknown header.  This document intends to define a
   standard format for IPv6 extension headers.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Proposed format

   This document proposes that all IPv6 extension headers be encoded in
   a consistent TLV format so that it is possible for nodes to skip over
   unknown extension headers and continue to further process the header
   chain.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Next Header  |  Hdr Ext Len  |                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               +
   |                                                               |
   .                                                               .
   .                  Header Specific Data                         .
   .                                                               .
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Next Header          8-bit selector.  Identifies the type of header
                        immediately following the Extension header.
                        Uses the same values as the IPv4 Protocol
                        field.
   Hdr Ext Len          8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the
                        Extension header in 8-octet units, not
                        including the first 8 octets.
   Header Specific      Variable length. Fields specific to the
   Data                 extension header

3.  Backward Compatibility

   The scheme proposed in this document is backward compatible with all
   the currently defined IPv6 extension headers except the Fragment
   Header.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Next Header  |   Reserved    |      Fragment Offset    |Res|M|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                         Identification                        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Figure 2: Fragment header layout

   This document proposes that the format of the extension header be
   changed to the following

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Next Header  |  Hdr Ext Len  |      Fragment Offset    |Res|M|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                         Identification                        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   Hdr Ext Len          8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the
                        Extension header in 8-octet units, not
                        including the first 8 octets.

   Figure 3: New fragment header layout

   Since the reserved field is currently required to be set to 0 and the
   length of the fragment header is 8 octets, the length field will
   remain as 0.  Because of this there will be no backward compatibility
   issues with existing implementations

4.  Security Considerations

   This document proposes a standard format for the IPv6 extension
   headers so that intermediate nodes,such as firewalls, that do not
   understand the headers can look past them.
