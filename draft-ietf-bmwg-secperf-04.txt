1. Introduction

   This document defines terms used in measuring the performance of
   firewalls. It extends the terminology already used for benchmarking
   routers and switches and adds terminology specific to firewalls. The
   primary metrics used in this document are bit forwarding rate and
   connections.

   There are several reasons why firewall performance measurements are
   needed. First, despite the rapid rise in firewall deployment, there
   is no standard means of performance measurement. Second,
   implementations vary widely, making it difficult to do direct
   performance comparisons. Finally, more and more organizations are

   deploying firewalls on internal networks operating at relatively high
   speeds, while most firewall implementations remain optimized for use
   over low-speed wide-area connections. As a result, users are often
   unsure whether the products they buy will stand up to relatively
   heavy loads.

2. Existing definitions

   This document uses the conceptual framework established in RFCs 1242
   and 1944 (for routers) and RFC 2285 (for switches). The router and
   switch documents contain discussions of several terms relevant to
   benchmarking the performance of firewalls. Readers should consult the
   router and switch documents before making use of this document.

   This document uses the definition format described in RFC 1242,
   Section 2. The sections in each definition are: definition,
   discussion, measurement units (optional), issues (optional), and
   cross-references.

3. Term definitions

3.1 Allowed traffic

   Definition:

      Packets forwarded as a result of the rule set of the device under
      test/system under test (DUT/SUT).

   Discussion:

      Firewalls typically are configured to forward only those packets
      explicitly permitted in the rule set. Forwarded packets MUST be
      included in calculating the bit forwarding rate or maximum bit
      forwarding rate of the DUT/SUT. All other packets MUST NOT be
      included in bit forwarding rate calculations.

   Measurement units:

      not applicable

   Issues:

      policy rule set

3.2 Application proxy

   Definition:

      A type of proxy service that is application aware. As such these
      proxies can ensure that only specific types of application
      commands and data pass through; authenticate the user creating the
      connection; dynamically open and close auxiliary ports sometimes

Newman                                                         Page [3]


INTERNET-DRAFT        Firewall Performance Terminology         July 1998

      required by applications.

   Discussion:

      Application proxies are aware of the type of data and application
      commands that are expected to be associated with a given TCP or
      UDP port and ensures that only such traffic is passed through
      those ports. For example, TCP port 21 should only allow FTP
      commands and responses through and not allow a non-FTP protocol to
      be used for potentially malicious means. An application proxy also
      can determine which dynamically allocated ports are required to
      allow the service to work properly. In the case of FTP, it
      requires that port 20 (ftp-data) be open for a period of time and
      then closed after the transfer is complete.

3.3 Authentication

   Definition:

      The process of verifying that a user requesting a network resource
      is who he, she, or it claims to be, and vice versa.

   Discussion: Trust is a critical concept in network security. Any
   network resource (such as a file server or printer) with restricted
   access MUST require authentication before granting access.

   Authentication takes many forms, including but not limited to IP
   addresses; TCP or UDP port numbers; passwords; external token
   authentication cards; and biometric identification such as signature,
   speech, or retina recognition systems.

   The entity being authenticated MAY be the client machine (for
   example, by proving that a given IP source address really is that
   address, and not a rogue machine spoofing that address) or a user (by
   proving that the user really is who he, she, or it claims to be).
   Servers SHOULD also authenticate themselves to clients.

   Testers should be aware that in an increasingly mobile society,

INTERNET-DRAFT        Firewall Performance Terminology         July 1998

   authentication based on machine-specific criteria such as an IP
   address or port number is not equivalent to verifying that a given
   individual is making an access request. At this writing systems that
   verify the identity of users are typically external to the firewall,
   and may introduce additional latency to the overall SUT.

3.4 Bit forwarding rate

   Definition:

      The number of bits per second of allowed traffic a DUT/SUT can be
      observed to transmit to the correct destination interface(s) in
      response to a specified offered load.

   Discussion:

      This definition differs substantially from section 3.17 of RFC
      1242 and section 3.6.1 of RFC 2285.

      Unlike both RFCs 1242 and 2285, this definition introduces the
      notion of different classes of traffic: allowed, illegal, and
      rejected (see definitions for each term). Any bit forwarding rate
      measurement MUST include only allowed traffic.

      Unlike RFC 1242, there is no reference to lost or retransmitted
      data. Forwarding rate is assumed to be a goodput measurement, in
      that only data successfully forwarded to the destination interface
      is measured. Bit forwarding rate MUST be measured in relation to
      the offered load. Bit forwarding rate MAY be measured with
      differed load levels, traffic orientation, and traffic
      distribution.

      Unlike RFC 2285, this measurement counts bits per second rather
      than frames per second. Per-frame metrics are not meaningful in
      the context of a flow of application data between endpoints.

      Units of measurement:

      bits per second

   Issues:

      Allowed traffic vs. rejected traffic

      allowed traffic
      goodput
      illegal traffic

3.5 Circuit proxy

   Definition:

      A type of proxy service that copies bytes between authorized
      source and destinations for defined TCP ports. The data is copied
      without any intelligent processing and the proxy cannot
      dynamically open and close application specific auxiliary ports
      that are sometimes required.

   Discussion:

      The key distinction with circuit proxies is that they are static
      and thus will always set up a connection if the DUT/SUT's rule set
      allows it. For example, if a firewall's rule set permits ftp
      connections, a circuit proxy will forward traffic on TCP port 20
      (ftp default data) even if no control connection was first
      established on TCP port 21 (ftp control).

3.6 Concurrent connections

   Definition:

      The aggregate number of simultaneous connections between hosts
      across the DUT/SUT, or between hosts and the DUT/SUT.

   Discussion:

      The number of concurrent connections a firewall can support is
      just as important a metric for some users as maximum bit

Newman                                                         Page [6]

      forwarding rate.

      While "connection" describes only a state and not necessarily the
      transfer of data, concurrency assumes that all existing
      connections are in fact capable of transferring data. If a data
      cannot be sent over a connection, that connection should not be
      counted toward the number of concurrent connections.

   Measurement units:

      Concurrent connections
      Maximum number of concurrent connections

   Issues:

   See also:

      connections
      connection establishment rate
      connection overhead

3.7 Connection

   Definition:

      A state in which two hosts, or a host and the DUT/SUT, agree to
      exchange data using a known protocol.

   Discussion:

      A connection is an abstraction describing an agreement between two
      nodes: One agrees to send data and the other agrees to receive it.

      Connections may be TCP sessions, but they don't have to be. Other
      connection-oriented protocols such as ATM also may be used, either
      instead of or in addition to TCP connections.

      What constitutes a connection depends on the application. For a
      "native ATM" application like a video stream, connections and
      virtual circuits can be synonymous. For TCP/IP applications on ATM
      networks (where multiple TCP sessions may ride over a single ATM
      virtual circuit), the number of TCP connections is probably the
      most important consideration.

      Additionally, in some cases firewalls may handle a mixture of
      native TCP and native ATM connections. In this situation, the
      wrappers around user data will differ. The most meaningful metric
      describes what an end-user will see.

      Data connections describe state, not data transfer. The existence
      of a connection does not imply that data travels on that
      connection at any given time, although if data cannot be forwarded
      on a previously established connection that connection should not
      be considered in any aggregrate connection count (see concurrent

Newman                                                         Page [7]


INTERNET-DRAFT        Firewall Performance Terminology         July 1998

      connections).

      A firewall's architecture dictates where a connection is
      terminated. In the case of proxy-based systems, a connection
      terminates at the DUT/SUT. But firewalls using packet filtering or
      stateful packet filtering designs act only as passthrough devices,
      in that they reside between two connection endpoints. Regardless
      of firewall architecture, the number of data connections is still
      relevant, since all firewalls perform some form of connection
      maintenance; at the very least, all check connection requests
      against their rule sets.

      Though it seems paradoxical, connectionless protocols such as UDP
      may also involve connections, at least for the purposes of
      firewall performance measurement. For example, one host may send
      UDP packets to another across a firewall. If the destination host
      is listening on the correct UDP port, it receives the UDP packets.
      For the purposes of firewall performance measurement, this is
      considered a connection. Indeed, some firewall implementations
      dynamically alter their rule sets to allow such connections.

   Measurement units:

      Connection establishment rate
      Concurrent connections
      Maximum number of concurrent connections

      proxy-based vs. stateful packet filtering
      TCP/IP vs. ATM

3.8 Connection establishment rate

   Definition:

      The length of time needed for two hosts, or a host and the
      DUT/SUT, to agree to set up a data exchange using a known
      protocol.

   Discussion:

      Each connection-oriented protocol has its own defined mechanisms
      for setting up a connection. For purposes of benchmarking firewall
      performance, this shall be the interval between receipt of the
      first octet of the packet carrying a connection establishment
      request on a DUT/SUT interface until transmission of the last

      octet of the last packet of the connection setup traffic headed in
      the opposite direction.

      This definition applies only to connection-oriented protocols such
      as TCP. For connectionless protocols such as UDP, the notion of
      connection setup time is not meaningful.

   Measurement units:

      Connection establishment rate

   Issues:

   See also:

      concurrent connections
      connection connection overhead

3.9 Connection overhead

   Definition:

      The degradation in bit forwarding rate, if any, observed as a
      result of the addition of one connection between two hosts through
      the DUT/SUT, or the addition of one connection from a host to the
      DUT/SUT.

   Discussion:

      The memory cost of connection establishment and maintenance is
      highly implementation-specific. This metric is intended to
      describe that cost in a method visible outside the firewall.

      It may also be desirable to invert this metric to show the
      performance improvement as a result of tearing down one
      connection.

   Measurement units:

      bit forwarding rate

   Issues:

3.10 Data source

   Definition:

      A station capable of generating traffic to the DUT/SUT.

   Discussion:

      One data source MAY emulate multiple users or stations. In
      addition, one data source MAY offer traffic to multiple network
      interfaces on the DUT/SUT.

   Measurement units:

      not applicable

   Issues:

      The term "data source" is deliberately independent of any number
      of users. It is useful to think of data sources simply as traffic
      generators, without any correlation to any given number of users.

3.11 Demilitarized zone (DMZ)

   Definition:

      A network segment or segments located between protected and
      unprotected networks. DMZ networks are sometimes called perimeter
      networks.

   Discussion:

      As an extra security measure, networks are often designed such
      that protected and unprotected segments are never directly
      connected. Instead, firewalls (and possibly public resources such
      as WWW or FTP servers) often reside on the so-called DMZ network.
      To connect protected, DMZ, and unprotected networks with one
      device, the device MUST have at least three network interfaces.

      Multiple firewalls MAY bound the DMZ. In this case, the firewalls
      connecting the protected network with the DMZ and the DMZ with the
      unprotected network MUST each have at least two network
      interfaces.

   Definition:

INTERNET-DRAFT        Firewall Performance Terminology         July 1998


      A device or group of devices that enforces an access control
      policy between networks.

   Discussion:

      While there are many different ways to accomplish it, all
      firewalls do essentially the same thing: control access between
      networks.

      The most common configuration involves a firewall connecting two
      segments (one protected and one unprotected), but this is not the
      only possible configuration. Many firewalls support tri-homing,
      allowing use of a DMZ network. It is possible for a firewall to
      accommodate more than three interfaces, each attached to a
      different network segment.

      The criteria by which access is controlled is deliberately not
      specified here. Typically this has been done using network- or
      transport-layer criteria (such as IP subnet or TCP port number),
      but there is no reason this must always be so. A growing number of
      firewalls are controlling access at the application layer, using
      user identification as the criterion. And firewalls for ATM
      networks may control access based on data link-layer criteria.

3.13 Goodput

   Definition:

      The number of bits per unit of time forwarded to the correct
      destination interface of the DUT/SUT, minus any bits lost or
      retransmitted.

   Discussion:

      Firewalls are generally insensitive to packet loss in the network.
      As such, measurements of gross bit forwarding rates are not
      meaningful since (in the case of proxy-based and stateful packet
      filtering firewalls) a receiving endpoint directly attached to a
      DUT/SUT would not receive any data dropped by the DUT/SUT.

      The type of traffic lost or retransmitted is protocol-dependent.

      TCP and ATM, for example, request different types of
      retransmissions. Testers MUST observe retransmitted data for the
      protocol in use, and subtract this quantity from measurements of
      gross bit forwarding rate.

3.14 Homed

   Definition:

      The number of logical interfaces a DUT/SUT contains.

   Discussion:

      Firewalls MUST contain at least two logical interfaces. In network
      topologies where a DMZ is used, the firewall contains at least
      three interfaces and is said to be tri-homed. Additional
      interfaces would make a firewall quad-homed, quint-homed, and so
      on.

      It is theoretically possible for a firewall to contain one
      physical interface and multiple logical interfaces. This
      configuration is strongly discouraged for testing purposes because
      of the difficulty in verifying that no leakage occurs between
      protected and unprotected segments.

3.15 Illegal traffic

   Definition:

      Packets specified for rejection in the rule set of the DUT/SUT.

INTERNET-DRAFT        Firewall Performance Terminology         July 1998


   Discussion:

      A buggy or misconfigured firewall may forward packets even though
      its rule set specifies that these packets be dropped. Illegal
      traffic differs from rejected traffic in that it describes all
      traffic specified for rejection by the rule set, while rejected
      traffic specifies only those packets actually dropped by the
      DUT/SUT.

3.16 Logging

   Definition:

      The recording of user requests made to the firewall.

   Discussion:

      Firewalls MUST log all requests they handle, both allowed and
      rejected. For many firewall designs, logging requires a
      significant amount of processing overhead, especially when complex
      rule sets are in use.

      The type and amount of data logged varies by implementation.
      Testers SHOULD attempt to log equivalent data when comparing
      different DUT/SUTs.

      Logging MAY take place on systems other than the DUT/SUT.

3.17 Network address translation (NAT)

   Definition:

      A function that maps the original IP source and/or destination
      addresses of packets arriving at a given interface of the firewall
      to a different address or addresses.

   Discussion:

      Firewalls use NAT to ensure that the IP addresses of a protected
      network are not visible to systems and users on the Internet or
      some other untrusted network. This is typically required since
      many networks use RFC 1918 reserved addresses.

      In the interest of conserving the IPv4 address space, RFC 1918
      proposed the use of certain private (reserved) blocks of IP
      addresses. Connections to public networks are made by use of a
      device that translates one or more RFC 1918 addresses to one or
      more public addresses--a network address translator (NAT).

      The use of private addressing also introduces a security benefit
      in that RFC 1918 addresses are not visible to hosts on the public
      Internet.

      Some NAT implementations are computationally intensive, and may
      affect bit forwarding rate.

      There are two common methods for NAT: many to one (aggregation)
      and one to one mapping. It should be noted that all proxy
      firewalls always perform NAT as a function of their architecture,
      while, by default, packet filtering firewalls do not. In general
      all application and circuit proxy firewalls, by default, perform
      NAT as a function of their architecture using the aggregation
      method, while stateful packet filtering firewalls do not perform
      NAT by default, but can be configured to do so.

   Discussion:

      Packet-filtering firewalls forward or deny packets based on
      information in each packet's header, such as IP address or TCP
      port number. A packet- filtering firewall uses a rule set to
      determine which traffic should be forwarded and which should be
      blocked.

      unprotected networks.

   Discussion:

      Security policies generally do not spell out specific
      configurations for firewalls; rather, they set general guidelines
      for what is and is not acceptable network access.

      The actual mechanism for enforcing the access policies is usually
      the rule set implemented in the DUT/SUT.

3.21 Protected network

   Definition:

      A network segment or segments to which access is controlled by the
      DUT/SUT.

   Discussion:

      Firewalls are intended to prevent unauthorized access either to or
      from the protected network. Depending on the configuration
      specified by the policy and rule set, the DUT/SUT may allow
      stations on the protected segment to act as clients for servers on
      either the DMZ or the unprotected network, or both.

      Protected networks are often called "internal networks." That term
      is not used here because firewalls increasingly are deployed
      within an organization, where all segments are by definition
      internal. It is also possible for a firewall to protected
      multiple, but different protected networks from each other.

3.22 Proxy

   Definition:

      A request for a connection made on behalf of a host.

   Discussion:

      Proxy-based firewalls do not allow direct connections between
      hosts. Instead, two connections are established: one between the
      client host and the DUT/SUT, and another between the DUT/SUT and
      server host.

      As with packet-filtering firewalls, proxy-based devices use a rule
      set to determine which traffic should be forwarded and which
      should be rejected.

      There are two types of proxies: application proxies and circuit
      proxies.

3.23 Rejected traffic

   Definition:

      Packets dropped as a result of the rule set of the DUT/SUT.

   Discussion:

      Firewalls MUST reject any traffic not explicitly permitted in the

      bit forwarding rate or maximum bit forwarding rate of the DUT/SUT.

3.24 Rule set

   Definition:

      The collection of access control rules that determines which
      packets the DUT/SUT will forward and which it will reject.

   Discussion:

      Rule sets control access to and from the network interfaces of the
      DUT/SUT. By definition, rule sets MUST NOT apply equally to all
      network interfaces; otherwise there would be no need for the
      firewall. Therefore, a specific rule set MUST be applied to each
      network interface in the DUT/SUT.

      The order of rules within the rule set is critical. Firewalls
      generally scan rule sets in a "top down" fashion, which is to say
      that the device compares each packet received with each rule in
      the rule set until it finds a rule that applies to the packet.
      Once the device finds an applicable rule, it applies the actions
      defined in that rule (such as forwarding or rejecting the packet)
      and ignores all subsequent rules. For testing purposes, the rule
      set MUST conclude with a rule denying all access.

3.25 Stateful packet filtering

   Definition:

      The process of forwarding or rejecting traffic based on the
      contents of a state table maintained by a firewall.

   Discussion:

INTERNET-DRAFT        Firewall Performance Terminology         July 1998

      Stateful packet filtering ensures that packets associated with an
      already established (and authorized) connection are allowed to be
      forwarded through the firewall. This differs from a simple packet
      filter firewall that would allow any packets through regardless of
      the state of that connection. For example, a stateful packet
      filtering device will reject a packet on port 20 (ftp-data) if no
      session has been established over the ftp control port (usually
      port 21).

3.26 Tri-homed

   Definition:

      A firewall with three network interfaces.

   Discussion:

      Tri-homed firewalls connect three network segments with different
      network addresses. Typically, these would be protected, DMZ, and
      unprotected segments.

      A tri-homed firewall may offer some security advantages over
      firewalls with two interfaces. An attacker on an unprotected
      network may compromise hosts on the DMZ but still not reach any
      hosts on the protected network.

   Measurement units:

      not applicable

   Issues:

      Usually the differentiator between one segment and another is its
      IP address. However, firewalls may connect different networks of
      other types, such as ATM or Netware segments.

   Definition:

      A network segment or segments to which access is not controlled by
      the DUT/SUT.

   Discussion:

      Firewalls are deployed between protected and unprotected segments.
      The unprotected network is not protected by the DUT/SUT.

      Note that a DUT/SUT's policy MAY specify hosts on an unprotected
      network. For example, a user on a protected network may be
      permitted to access an FTP server on an unprotected network. But
      the DUT/SUT cannot control access between hosts on the unprotected
      network.

3.28 User

   Definition:

      A person or process requesting access to resources protected by
      the DUT/SUT.

   Discussion:

      "User" is a problematic term in the context of firewall
      performance testing, for several reasons. First, a user may in
      fact be a process or processes requesting services through the
      DUT/SUT. Second, different "user" requests may require radically
      different amounts of DUT/SUT resources. Third, traffic profiles
      vary widely from one organization to another, making it difficult
      to characterize the load offered by a typical user.

      For these reasons, it's probably not a good idea to measure
      DUT/SUT performance in terms of users supported. The only
      exception is in cases where traffic patterns are well understood
      and constant--conditions that unfortunately don't exist in many
      networks. Instead, it's preferable to describe performance in
      terms of maximum bit forwarding rate and maximum number of
      connections sustained. It's also preferable to use the term "data

4. Security considerations

   The primary goal of this memo is to describe terms used in
   benchmarking firewall performance. However, readers should be aware
   that there is some overlap between performance and security issues.
   Specifically, the optimal configuration for firewall performance may
   not be the most secure, and vice-versa.

   Further, certain forms of attack may degrade performance. One common
   form of denial-of-service (DoS) attack bombards a firewall with so
   much rejected traffic that it cannot forward allowed traffic. DoS
   attacks do not always involve heavy loads; DoS describes any state in
   which a firewall is offered rejected traffic that prohibits it from
   forwarding some or all allowed traffic. Even a small amount of
   traffic-- such as the recent Teardrop2 attack involving a few packet
   fragments-- may significantly degrade firewall performance, or stop
   the firewall altogether. Further, the safeguards in firewalls to
   guard against such attacks may have a significant negative impact on
   performance.

   Since the library of attacks is constantly expanding, no attempt is
   made here to define specific attacks that may affect performance.
   Nonetheless, any reasonable performance benchmark must take
   safeguards against such attacks into consideration. Specifically, the
   same safeguards must be in place when comparing performance of
   different firewall implementations.
