Abstract


   Today, the use of anycasting is quite limited. In this document we
   list possible deployment scenarios in IPv6 anycasting. We consider
   three conditions based on the region of anycasting, and list possible

   scenarios. For each scenario we also clarify example applications as
   well as technical issues to be resolved.


1. Introduction


   Anycast is service-based addressing architecture, which is promising
   for providing new services. However, currently the use of anycasting
   is quite limited. One of a main reason is because the use only of the
   anycast is not so clear. Another reason is because there are many
   technical issues to be resolved in the current definitions of IPv6
   anycast. Most of problems are stated in [ANALYSIS].


   In this document we list possible deployment scenarios in IPv6
   anycasting. We classify three groups according to the applicable
   region of anycasting (intra-segment, intra-domain, inter-domain). We
   also focus on the necessity of current protocol changes and/or
   introducing new protocols/definitions. For each scenario, we clarify
   (1) example of possible applications, (2) addressing, (3)
   reachability of packets, (4) required functionalities, and (5)
   requirements of existing protocol changes.


   The objective of this document is to list all considerable cases of
   anycast deployment, but concluding what scenario is best is out of
   scope.


Terminology


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119]. Other
   terms in this document are defined in [ANYTERM].


2. Background Technologies



2.1 Limitation of IPv6 Anycast


   As noted in [ANALYSIS], the main limitations of IPv6 anycast are


   1. Only the router node can notify the routing information, thus the
      anycast address cannot be assigned to the host node.
   2. The anycast address is assigned from the unicast addressing space,
      so the anycast address is syntactically indistinguishable from the
      unicast address.
   3. From the second limitation, the anycast address cannot be set as
      the source address of the packet because the anycast initiator
      cannot identify packets from different anycast receivers if they
      send packets by setting the anycast address as the source.

Internet-Draft   Deployment Scenario of IPv6 Anycasting     October 2004



2.2 Shared Unicast


   Shared unicast is a similar practice to anycast, in which multiple
   nodes can have the same unicast address. The packet destinied to the
   shared unicast address is delivered one of those nodes based on the
   distance from the source node. But there are several differences
   between anycast and shared unicast [ANALYSIS]. We only focus on IPv6
   anycasting and the deployment scenarios on shared unicast are not
   scope of this document. However, some scenarios in this document can
   be applied to shared unicast, and some shared unicast practices are
   also useful to consider the deployment scenario on anycasting.


2.3 Discovery of Anycast Members


   IPv6 addressing architecture [RFC 2731] prohibits from assigning the
   anycast address to the host node until the use of anycast address
   becomes safe (in terms of security) and some avoiding mechanism
   against illegal use of anycasting arise.


   The problem of secure group management are stated in some research
   groups (e.g., IRTF Group Security (GSEC) Research Group). But they
   are still in discussion. Current possible techniques are:


   1. use the extension of MLD (multicast listener discovery) [MLDEXT]
   2. establish a virtual p-to-p tunnel from the anycast receiver to the
      router with authorization
   3. configure (authorize) the router to receive the anycast routing
      information from anycast receivers


2.4 Virtual Path


   In most cases it is not directly connected between the anycast
   receiver and the anycast router (and between two anycast routers). In
   this case a virtual path should be established between two anycast
   nodes.


2.5 Scope


   If we consider a global use of anycasting, the scaling problem of
   routing table will be arisen. The router must have "host route" for
   the anycast address when multiple anycast receivers are on different
   segments which have different unicast prefixes. According to the
   increase of the number of anycast address, the explosion of the size
   of routing table will lead a serious performance degradation of
   routers.


   Furthermore, even if there are many anycast receivers, it is rare
   that all of receivers will be "appropriate" for each anycast




Ata, et al.              Expires April 25, 2005                 [Page 3]
Internet-Draft   Deployment Scenario of IPv6 Anycasting     October 2004



   initiator, i.e., for each initiator some of receivers may be
   appropriate, but others are not needed. Many of routing entries for
   the anycast address are thus not frequently utilized.


   In both scalability and usability, most of anycast entries must be
   restricted for advertising arbitrary routers. Introducing "scope"
   will be preferable to limit the range of propagation of anycast
   routing entries.


3. Intra-Segment Anycasting
3.1 Local Served Anycast Receivers


   In this scenario the anycast receiver is on the same segment of the
   anycast initiator. Fig. 1 shows an example.


                                      +----+
                                   +--| AI |
                                   |  +----+
                       +--------+  |
                (WAN)--| Router |--+
                       +--------+  |
                                   |  +----+
                                   +--| AR |
                                      +----+


                   Fig. 1 Local served anycast receiver


   The anycast receiver AR only configures the anycast address AA in
   addition to the unicast address. No route information is notified to
   Router. The anycast initiator AI discovers the anycast receiver AR by
   performing lower layer's address resolving protocols (e.g., Neighbor
   Discovery).


   * Possible applications:


      primitive service discovery (DNS, proxy, SMTP, etc.)


   * Addressing:


      The anycast receiver MUST assign the ancyast address from:


      1. unused space of the subnet prefix which the corresponding
         unicast address belongs to.
      2. predefined well-known link-local anycast address.


   * Packet reachability:


      The anycast packet is always delivered when the anycast receiver




Ata, et al.              Expires April 25, 2005                 [Page 4]
Internet-Draft   Deployment Scenario of IPv6 Anycasting     October 2004



      exists in the same segment.


   * Requirements:


      1. Nodes SHOULD NOT use the anycast address outside of the
         segment.
      2. No special routing protocols for the anycast address is NOT
         required.


   * Requirements of protocol changes:


      none


3.2 Multiple Anycast Receivers within the Same Segment


   This is one of the simplest scenario. All anycast receivers are on
   the segment. The prefix address of the anycast address is the same as
   the one of the corresponding unicast address. Fig. 2 shows an example
   of this scenario. In this figure there are three anycast receivers
   (AR1, AR2, AR3). All anycast receivers have the same anycast address
   AA. AA is assigned from the available space of the subnet which
   anycast receivers are belonging to.


                                                +-----+
                                             +--| AR1 |
                                             |  +-----+
          +----+                 +--------+  |  +-----+
          | AI |----- (WAN) -----| Router |--+--| AR2 |
          +----+                 +--------+  |  +-----+
                                             |  +-----+
                                             +--| AR3 |
                                                +-----+
           Fig. 2  All anycast receivers are on the same segment


   The packet destinied to the anycast address AA is forwarded to the
   last hop router based on the unicast routing by the subnet prefix of
   AA. After arriving at the last hop router, the destination receiver
   is determined by the last hop router. The selection of the final
   destination is performed by e.g., Neighbor Discovery [RFC 2461].


   * Possible applications:


      clustering servers, load balancing, replicated servers to improve
      reliabilitiy


   * Addressing:


      The anycast receiver MUST assign the ancyast address from unused




Ata, et al.              Expires April 25, 2005                 [Page 5]
Internet-Draft   Deployment Scenario of IPv6 Anycasting     October 2004



      space of the subnet prefix which the corresponding unicast address
      belongs to.


   * Packet reachability:


      The anycast packet can be delivered when the anycast receiver
      exists in the segment. However, when the selected anycast receiver
      falls down, packets will not be delivered until the last hop
      router updates its learned information (e.g., Neighbor Cache).


   * Requirements:


      1. Set the same anycast address only to anycast receivers on the
         same segment. Anycast receivers on the different segments MUST
         be set the different anycast addresses.
      2. No special routing protocols for the anycast address is NOT
         required.
      3. Configuring the learning time (aging time) on the last hop
         router could improve the adaptability of load balancing.


   * Requirements of protocol changes:


      none


4. Scoped Anycasting


   The use of inter-segment anycasting has a scaling problem, in which
   the routing of anycast packet requires routers to add a host entry
   (e.g., /128 prefix entry) for each anycast membership. To overcome
   the scale problem, the advertisement of anycast routing information
   is highly restricted. There are some approaches to limit the
   advertisement. First is to allow the exchange of anycast routing
   information only within the controlled domain (e.g., AS). Second is
   to tell the routing information only the neighbor domains. We
   consider above both cases separately.


4.1 Inter-Domain Anycasting


   In the controlled area (e.g., domain) the influence of adding host
   entry for the anycast is limited within the controlled region. Thus
   the administrative operator can use anycasting to receive benefits of
   anycasting. The simple way to support anycasting to add a host entry
   of anycast receiver manually (i.e., the selection of anycast
   receivers is performed by the statical configures) by using exting
   unicast intra-domain routing protocols (e.g., OSPF). However, in such
   a static approach, the blackout time of switching to an alternative
   receiver would be long if the active receiver fails. To improve the
   service reliability, the selection of anycast receivers would be

   performed dynamically. The current IPv6 definition [RFC 2373],
   however, prohibits host nodes from advertising their route
   information to routers. Fig. 3 shows the example of intra-domain
   anycasting.

                      Fig. 3  Intra-domain Anycasting


   * Possible applications:


      load balancing, alternative servers for reliabilitiy, service
      discovery


   * Addressing:


      The anycast receiver SHOULD assign the anycast address from any
      arbitrary of unused space. However, assigning from the segment-
      independent subnet space would be better.


   * Packet reachability:


      The anycast packet can be delivered when the anycast receiver
      exists in the domain. However, when the selected anycast receiver
      falls down, packets will not be delivered until the router update
      related routing entries.


   * Requirements:


      1. Routers MUST NOT advertise entries of anycast receivers to
         outside of the domain.
      2. Routing entry of anycast receivers should be added manually or
         dynamically.
      3. If manually, the administrative operator configures all of
         routing entries of anycast receivers.

Internet-Draft   Deployment Scenario of IPv6 Anycasting     October 2004



      4. If dynamically, the anycast receiver MUST advertise its host-
         based routing entry by running routing daemons. However, this
         item requires a modification of current IPv6 definition.
      5. Unicast-based routing protocols (IGPs) can be utilized for
         exchanging anycast entries.


   * Requirements of protocol changes:


      To update the routing entry of anycast receiver dymanically, we
      MUST change the definition of IPv6 anycast to enable anycast host
      nodes to advertise the routing information.



4.2 Regional Anycasting


   The second way to limit the propagation of anycast routing
   information is to set the scope (e.g., hoplimit) to routing messages.
   For example, when we set the hop limit of anycast routing messages to
   one, anycast routing information is advertised only the neighbor
   domains directly connected to the domain which the anycast receiver
   belong to. Fig. 4 shows the example to limit the region of
   anycasting.


   In this figure, we set the hop limit of anycst routing messages as
   the scope of the corresponding anycast address. Anycast receiver AR1
   is on the domain AS1, and notify the route for the anycast address to
   the edge router of AS1. The edge router of AS1 then sends the routing
   entry for the anycast address to neighbor domains AS2, AS3, and AS4.
   However, because the hop limit of the routing message is one, the
   message is not delivered to domains AS5 and AS6, which are out of
   scope of the anycast address.

                        Fig. 4  Regional Anycasting


   Most characteristics on the regional anycasting are the same as ones
   on intra-domain anycasting.


   * Possible applications:


      providing regional services (e.g., proxy), location dependent
      mirror servers (e.g., based on countries)


   * Addressing:


      The anycast receiver SHOULD assign the anycast address from any
      arbitrary of unused space.


   * Packet reachability:


      The anycast packet can be delivered when the anycast receiver
      exists in the domain. However, when the selected anycast receiver
      falls down, packets will not be delivered until the router update
      related routing entries.


   * Requirements:


      1. Routing messages for the anycast address MUST include the scope
         of the anycast address.
      2. Routers MUST NOT advertise entries of anycast receivers to
         outside the scope.
      3. Routing entry of anycast receivers should be added manually or
         dynamically.
      4. If manually, the administrative operator configures all of
         routing entries of anycast receivers.
      5. If dynamically, the anycast receiver MUST advertise its host-
         based routing entry by running routing daemons. However, this
         item requires a modification of current IPv6 definition.
      6. Unicast-based routing protocols (IGPs) can be utilized for
         exchanging anycast entries.


   * Requirements of protocol changes:


      Same as intra-domain anycasting.  To update the routing entry of
      anycast receiver dymanically, we MUST change the definition of
      IPv6 anycast to enable anycast host nodes to advertise the routing
      information.


5. Inter-domain Anycasting


   Due to the scale problem, the existing unicast routers are not

   suitable for forwarding anycast packets in case of inter-domain
   anycast routing. It is preferable to deploy a special node which
   handles anycast packets based on anycast routing. For deploying
   anycast routers, we consider three cases based on the number of
   anycast routers. Note that this section is also an example of
   transition scenario for supporting anycast.


5.1 Single Anycast Router


   Anycast seed [ANYTERM] is one of solution for supporting global
   anycasting without modification of existing network framework.
   Anycast seed is a primary node of the anycast membership.  Anycast
   members have the anycast address, which is also the unicast address
   of the anycast seed. Without any settings, all packets destinied to
   the anycast address are once forwarded to the anycast seed by the
   unicast routing. After that, the anycast seed then redirect the
   "appropriate" anycast receiver via the virtual path between anycast
   seed and anycast receiver. As a result, the anycast seed acts as the
   anycast router for the anycast address. Fig. 5 shows the example of
   anycast seed.


                                         +-----+ Anycast

                 Fig. 5  Anycast Seed (... : virtual path)


   In this figure, there are four member nodes for the anycast address
   AA. AA is also the unicast address of Seed. Seed and other members
   (AR1, AR2, AR3) are connected virtually (e.g., tunnels). All packets
   to the anycast address AA are once sent to Seed node. After receiving
   the anycast packet, Seed then decides the appropriate node for the
   anycast packet and sent to it through the virtual path.


   * Possible applications:


      mirroring service, load distribution


   * Addressing:


      The anycast receiver MUST assign the unicast address of anycast
      seed as the anycast address.

   * Packet reachability:


      Whenever the anycast seed is alive, the anycast packet is always
      delivered at least to the anycast seed.  Otherwise (i.e., the
      anycast seed is not available), no packet is delivered even if
      other receivers are alive.


   * Requirements:


      1. Anycast seed MUST have a capability to forward the anycast
         packet.
      2. Anycast seed SHOULD have a knowledge about the condition of
         anycast receivers, and SHOULD have a procedure to select the
         appropriate receiver for the anycast packet.
      3. Other anycast receiver MUST accept to establish the virtual
         path from the anycast seed.


   * Requirements of protocol changes:


      none


5.2 Multiple Seeds


   Anycast seed is a kind of anycast router. When the number of anycast
   packets increases, the ancyast seed will become a bottleneck. To
   reduce the load of the anycast seed, it is effective to deploy
   multiple seeds on the network.

                Fig. 6  Multiple Seeds (... : virtual path)


   Fig. 6 shows the example of multiple seeds. There are two anycast
   seeds and three anycast receivers. All of anycast nodes have the same
   address AA. The deployment of seeds S1 and S2 is the same as regional
   anycasting (See 4.2 for details). All seeds and anycast receivers are

   connected virtually eath other. In this figure, S1, S2 is a nearest
   receiver for AI1, AI2, respectively. When S1 and S2 receive anycast
   packets, they forward an approprite receiver selected from all
   receivers. By increasing the number of seeds, the load of seed nodes
   become degraded.



   * Possible applications:


      Same as single seed case.


   * Addressing:


      Same as regional anycasting case.


   * Packet reachability:


      Same as regional anycasting case. However, if the anycast seed is
      not available, no packet is delivered even if other receivers are
      alive.


   * Requirements:


      Requirements of both regional anycasting and single seed cases are
      needed.


   * Requirements of protocol changes:


      Same as regional anycasting case.


5.3 Generalized Anycast Routers


   Anycast seed is a specialized anycast router for the single anycast
   address. By assigning multiple anycast address into a single anycast
   seed node, the anycast seed can support multiple anycast addresses.
   As a result, the anycast seed would become a generic anycast router.
   The architecture of this scenario is the same as the multiple seeds
   case except supporting the multiple anycast addresses. Howver, the
   criteria of appropriate node selection may differ between different
   anycast addresses. A generic anycast-based routing protocol is needed
   to handle multiple node selection criterias.


6. Security Considerations


   Anycasting potentially has some technical statements about security
   shown in [ANALYSIS].
