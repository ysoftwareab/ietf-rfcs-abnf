1.  Introduction

   This document discusses how a Controller can use the RESTCONF
   protocol [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf] to configure Large-Scale
   Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) Measurement Agents
   [RFC7594].  It also discusses how RESTCONF can be used by a
   Measurement Agent to report measurement results to a Collector.

   Measurement Agents may be deployed as separate hardware devices or as
   functions embedded in consumer electronic devices and home routers or
   as pure software solutions that can be installed on off-the-shelf
   computing equipment.  Measurement Agents receive instructions from a
   Controller about when and how to conduct what measurements (the
   measurement schedule) and how and when to report measurement results
   to a data Collector (the report schedule).  Further information about
   the interaction between Measurement Agents and Controllers and
   Collectors can be found in [RFC7594].

   The LMAP information model [I-D.ietf-lmap-information-model] defines
   the information exchanged between a Controller and an Measurement
   Agent and the information exchanged between an Measurement Agent and
   a Collector.  An information model is conceptual and protocol-
   independent.  A concrete YANG [RFC6020] data model derived from the
   conceptual information model is defined in [I-D.ietf-lmap-yang].

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the LMAP terminology defined in [RFC7594].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Overview of RESTCONF

   The RESTCONF protocol [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf] provides a REST-
   like interface to access and manipulate a so-called unified YANG
   datastore [RFC6020].  The basic idea behind RESTCONF is expose a YANG
   datastores as a collection of Web resources that can be manipulated
   using standard HTTP [RFC7230] DELETE, PATCH, POST, and PUT methods.
   The resource hierarchy is derived from the nesting structure of the
   YANG schema tree, leading to a so-called data model driven REST API.

   RESTCONF is essentially a convention how to use HTTP over TLS to
   access a datastore that has a structure defined by a YANG data model.
   The data is exchanged in XML encoding or JSON encoding.

   The normal mode of operation is that the RESTCONF client initiates a
   secure transport to the RESTCONF server.  For devices located behind
   a NAT, a so called 'call-home' mechanism has been defined
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-call-home] that enables the RESTCONF server to
   establish a secure transport to a RESTCONF client.  Note that call
   home only changes the TCP connection establishment, the TLS and HTTP
   client/server roles do not change.  The policy used to call home can
   be configured through a configuration data model
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-server-model].  This model provides a mechanism to
   configure a list of redundant endpoints and it provides control over
   call-home policies (e.g, call-home frequency, idle-timers, keep-alive
   timers).

3.  RESTCONF as LMAP Control Protocol

   It is straight-forward to use RESTCONF as a control protocol.  The
   YANG data model [I-D.ietf-lmap-yang] derived from the underlying
   information model [I-D.ietf-lmap-information-model] translates into a
   collection of RESTCONF resources that can be manipulated at various
   levels of granularity using DELETE, PATCH, POST, and PUT methods.

   An example exchange showing a REST call to create a schedule object
   is shown in Appendix A.

4.  RESTCONF as LMAP Report Protocol

   For reporting results from the Measurement Agent to a Collector, the
   Collector is assumed to act as a RESTCONF server.  The Measurement
   Agent pushes results to the Collector by invoking an operation on the
   Controller.

   Below is an XML representation of instance data conforming to the

   Below is an example showing how RESTCONF can be used to create the
   above schedule.  The prefix C: indicates the Controller, the prefix
   M: indicates the Measurement Agent.  This example uses a JSON
   encoding (and note that much of the white-space can be removed, this
   is only there to help with readability).
