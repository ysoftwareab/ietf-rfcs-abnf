Notify = Notify message


     Figure 4: Reservation Failure With Sender Notification via Notify

   For local failures on the Receiver Proxy node, if a similar failure
   on an RSVP midpoint would cause the generation of a ResvErr (for
   example, CAC failure), the Receiver Proxy MUST generate a Notify
   towards the sender.  The Receiver Proxy MAY additionally generate a
   Notify upon local failures which would not ordinarily cause
   generation of a ResvErr message, such as described in Appendix B of
   [RFC2205].

   When the method of sender notification via Notify message is used, it
   is RECOMMENDED that the RSVP Receiver Proxy also issues sender
   notification via a PathErr message.  This maximizes the chances that
   the notification reaches the sender in all situations (e.g. even if
   some RSVP routers do not support the Notify procedure, or if a Notify
   message gets dropped).  However, for controlled environments (e.g.
   where all RSVP routers are known to support Notify procedures) and
   where it is desirable to minimize the volume of signaling, the RSVP
   Receiver Proxy MAY rely exclusively on sender notification via Notify
   message and thus not issue sender notification via PathErr message.
