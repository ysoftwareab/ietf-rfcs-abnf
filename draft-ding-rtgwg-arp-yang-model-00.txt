1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] data model for Address
   Resolution Protocol [RFC826] implementation and identification of
   some common properties within a device containing a Network
   Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) server.  Devices that are managed by
   NETCONF and perhaps other mechanisms have common properties that need
   to be configured and monitored in a standard way.

   The data model convers configuration of system parameters of ARP,
   such as static ARP entries, timeout for dynamic ARP entries,
   interface ARP, proxy ARP, and so on.  It also provides information
   about running state of ARP implementations.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  client

   o  configuration data

   o  server

   o  state data

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is presented
   in Section 3.

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.  Problem Statement

   This document defines a YANG [RFC7950] configuration data model that
   may be used to configure the ARP feature running on a system.  YANG
   models can be used with network management protocols such as NETCONF
   [RFC6241] to install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of
   network devices.

   The data model makes use of the YANG "feature" construct which allows
   implementations to support only those ARP features that lie within
   their capabilities.  It is intended this model be used by service
   providers who manipulate devices from different vendors in a standard
   way.

   This module can be used to configure the ARP applications for
   discovering the link layer address associated with a given Internet
   layer address.

3.  Design of the Data Model

   This data model intends to describe the processing that a protocol
   finds the hardware address, also known as Media Access Control (MAC)
   address, of a host from its known IP address.  These tasks include,
   but are not limited to, adding a static entry in the ARP cache,
   configuring ARP cache entry timeout, and clearing dynamic entries
   from the ARP cache.

Internet-Draft               ARP YANG model                 January 2018


   This data model has one top level container, ARP, which consists of
   several second level containers.  Each of these second level
   containers describes a particular category of ARP handling, such as
   defining static mapping between an IP address (32-bit address) and a
   Media Access Control (MAC) address (48-bit address).

5.  Data Model Examples

   This section presents a simple but complete example of configuring
   static ARP entries and interfaces, based on the YANG module specified
   in Section 4.

5.1.  Static ARP entries

   Requirement:
   Enable common static ARP entry configuration.
      <config xmlns:xc="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
         <arp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-arp">
            <arp-static-tables>
                       <ip-address> 10.2.2.3 </ip-address>
                       <mac-address> 00e0-fc01-0000 </mac-address>
                </arp-static-tables>
         </arp>


   Requirement:
   Enable long static ARP entry configuration.
      <config xmlns:xc="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
         <arp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-arp">
            <arp-long-static-tables>
                       <vrf-name> __public__ </vrf-name>
                       <ip-address> 10.2.2.3 </ip-address>
                       <mac-address> 00e0-fc01-0000 </mac-address>
                       <if-name> GE1/0/1 </if-name>
                </arp-long-static-tables>
         </arp>

5.2.  ARP interfaces

   Requirement:
   Enable static ARP interface configuration.

      <config xmlns:xc="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
         <arp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-arp">

                       <arp-learn-disable>false</arp-learn-disable>
                   <proxy-enable>false</proxy-enable>
                       <probe-interval>5</probe-interval>
                       <probe-times>3</probe-times>
                       <probe-unicast>false</probe-unicast>
                       <arp-gratuitous>false</arp-gratuitous>
                       <arp-gratuitous-interval>60</arp-gratuitous-interval>
                       <arp-gratuitous-drop>false</arp-gratuitous-drop>
                       <arp-if-limits>
                          <vlan-id>3</vlan-id>
                          <limit-number>65535</limit-number>
                          <threshold-value>80</threshold-value>
                   </arp-if-limits>
             </arp-interfaces>
         </arp>

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via YANG based management protocols, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols have mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS) with mutual
   authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC6536] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability:

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.
