                        GRE Tunnel Fragmentation
                  draft-templin-intarea-grefrag-01.txt

Abstract

   GRE tunnels use IPv4 or IPv6 fragmentation of the delivery packet
   when the delivery packet exceeds the tunnel MTU, or when otherwise
   necessary.  This can cause problems when unmitigated IPv4
   fragemntation ensues, or when middleboxes drop IPv6 fragments
   unconditionally.  This document proposes GRE tunnel fragmentation
   which avoids these pitfalls..

1.  Introduction

   GRE is specified in [RFC2784] and [RFC2890].  In its current
   manifestation, GRE allows for fragmentation of the payload packet
   only if it is an IPv4 packet with the Don't Fragment (DF) bit set to
   0.  GRE also allows for fragmentation of the delivery packet, but
   this can cause problems in some applications.  A third option
   (introduced here) is for the GRE tunnel to perform tunnel
   fragmentation and reassembly on the payload packet.

   In this way, the ingress can fragment the payload packet (while
   treating the payload packet's headers as ordinary data) and
   encapsulate each fragment in a separate delivery header.  The GRE
   header requires a new fragment header field to support this.

   This tunnel fragmentation method was first suggested in Section 3.1.7
   of [RFC2764], and also appears in more recent works
   [I-D.templin-aerolink] [I-D.herbert-gue-fragmentation].

2.  GRE Fragmentation Header

   Figure 1 shows the GRE header as specified in [RFC2784][RFC2890] but
   with a new optional "Fragment Header" and a new control bit "F":

                 Figure 1: GRE Header with Fragment Header

   In this format, when the "F" bit is set to 1 the GRE header includes
   a Fragment header formatted as specified in Section 4.5 of [RFC2460].

3.  GRE Tunnel Fragmentation Procedures

   GRE tunnel fragmentation treats the entire GRE payload packet
   (including the payload headers) as opaque data.  The GRE tunnel
   ingress breaks the payload packet into N fragments and encapsulates
   each fragment in a separate GRE header and GRE delivery header.  The
   first fragment therefore includes the GRE payload headers and first
   portion of the GRE payload data, while subsequent fragments include
   the remaining portions of the GRE payload data.  The GRE tunnel
   ingress then sends each fragment to the GRE tunnel egress.  Apart
   from the appearance of the Fragment Header within the GRE header, the
   fragmentation procedure is the same as for IPv6 fragmentation.

   When the GRE tunnel egress receives the fragments, it reassembles the
   GRE payload packet by concatenating the data portions of each
   fragment according to their offsets.  Apart from the appearance of
   the Fragment Header within the GRE header, the reassembly procedure
   is the same as for IPv6 reassembly.

   In order to support this fragmentation and reassembly procedure, the
   GRE tunnel ingress must know the maximum sized packet the GRE tunnel
   egress is capable of reassembling, i.e., the Maximum Reassembly Unit
   (MRU).  The GRE tunnnel egress MUST therefore configure a minimum MRU
   of 2KB, and MAY configure a larger MRU.
