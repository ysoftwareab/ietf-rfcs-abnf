Abstract

   This draft proposes a new fast handover mechanism for Mobile IPv6 
   based IEEE 802.16e wireless networks. To implement the proposed 
   mechanism, the IEEE 802.16e neighbor advertisement message, named 
   MOB_NBR-ADV, sent periodically by a serving base station (BS) is 
   assumed to be defined newly by adding a specific subfield to the 
   available reserved field. In addition, Router Information 
   Request/Reply messages used in the network layer are defined newly. 
   The proposed mechanism provides the faster acquisition of new 
   access router's network information than the existing one, which 
   might be advantageous for the low handover latency. In addition, the
   proposed mechanism might reduce amount of traffic in comparison with
   the existing one, which might be remarkable when there are many 
   mobile nodes that are now connecting to the current access router 
   (AR). Moreover, in the proposed mechanism, a mobile node can know 
   whether it changes AR or BS, which can remove redundant traffic 
   of the existing one.

1.  Introduction

   In future Mobile IPv6 based IEEE 802.16e wireless networks, the need 
   to communicate efficiently on the move and to minimize to packet loss
   caused by a handover is becoming increasingly important because a 
   handover latency would be unacceptable for real-time Internet 
   services. Thus, in recent, a fast handover mechanism [1]-[3] has been
   proposed for Mobile IPv6 as a way to reduce a L3 handover latency.

   In the curren draft, a new fast handover mechanism  is proposed to 
   reduce the L3 handover latency for Mobile IPv6 based IEEE 802.16e 
   wireless networks where there are several access routers (ARs) 
   connected by base stations (BSs). To implement the proposed 
   mechanism, the IEEE 802.16e neighbor advertisement message, named 
   MOB_NBR-ADV, sent periodically by a serving BS is assumed to be 
   defined newly by adding a specific subfield to the available reserved
   field. Using this message, a mobile node (MN) can know whether it 
   changes AR or BS. In addition, Router Information Request/Reply 
   messages used in L3 are defined newly. Using these messages, the MN
   can acquire network information about all ARs, such as ARs' IP 
   addresses, prefix lengths, and identifiers, which is performed once
   only at the booting time and isn't performed in real-time 
   communication. In real-time communication, this network information 
   allows the MN to formulate a new care-of address and to be able to 
   communicate immediately when the MN changes its point of attachment 
   from the current AR (CAR) to the new AR (NAR). That is, the proposed 
   mechanism can omit a Router Solicitation for a Proxy (RtSolPr) message 
   and a Proxy Router Advertisement (PrRtAdv) message used in the 
   existing one [1]-[3], in real-time communication. This means that the 
   proposed mechanism provides the faster acquisition of NAR's network 
   information than the existing one, which might be remarkable for low 
   L3 handover latency. In addition, the omission of above two messages 
   might reduce amount of traffic when there are many MNs that are now 
   connecting to the CAR. Moreover, in the proposed mechanism, the MN 
   can know whether it changes AR or BS while the existing one cannot. 
   Thus, when the MN changes BS, the proposed mechanism can remove 
   redundant traffic of the existing one.

3.  Network Configuration

   This draft considers an IEEE 802.16e wireless network where there are 
   serveral ARs connected by several BSs as shown in Figure 1. 
   This network configuration is feasible because several access routers 
   in the IEEE 802.16e wireless network can cover quite wide area where
   the MN can moves. These ARs can share each other's network 
   information, such as ARs' IP addresses, prefix lengths, and 
   identifiers, and thus may have information table that will be called 
   the Router Information Table (RIT). Note that the BS can know its AR 
   identifier (ARID) by a system administrator's presetting.   

   Note that a change of BS on same subnet does not require a change of 
   AR because the handover between two BSs (i.e., between BS5 and BS7) 
   within same subnet can be carried out using link layer mobility 
   without IP mobility. The handover between two BSs is outside the 
   scope of L3 handover mechanisms. However, a change of BS between 
   different subnets (i.e., between BS7 and BS8) require a change of AR
   using IP mobility, because the MN would be attaching to a different 
   subnet. In this case, a L3 handover mechanism would need to be 
   invoked in order to provide low handover latency between the two ARs. 
   Therefore, it should be required to know whether the MN changes BS 
   or AR. Note that this draft borrows all of the terminology from the 
   existing mechanism [1]-[3] and the IEEE 802.16e specification [4].

4.1  New IEEE 802.16e Neighbor Advertisement Message (MOB_NBR-ADV)

   In order to implement the proposed mechanism, the IEEE 802.16e 
   neighbor advertisement message[4], named MOB_NBR-ADV, sent 
   periodically by a serving BS is assumed to be defined newly by 
   adding a specific subfield "ARID" to the available reserved field.     
   Since this field uses the available reserved field, other fields
   are not affected. Using this new message, the MN can know whether 
   it changes AR or BS, which will be explained later.
   
4.2  Router Information Request/Reply Message Formats

   In order to implement the proposed mechanism, Router Information 
   Request/Reply messages used in L3 are defined newly. These messages 
   are made from the Internet Control Message Protocol for IPv6 
   (ICMPv6) in [5]. Then, using these messages, the MN performs the 
   Router Information Request/Reply at its booting time.
    
   Fig. 1  shows the Router Information Request message. This message 
   is used by the MN to request network information about all ARs from 
   one of them. The description of each fields are as follows:
   
   
     0                   1                   2                   3

   o Code : 0

   o Identifier : MUST be set by the sender so that replies can be 
   matched to this request.

   In the IP header of this message, the source address is an IP address 
   assigned to the sending interface and the destination address is the 
   address of the all routers multicast address.

5.  Operation Procedure of Proposed Mechanism

   The operation procedure of the proposed mechanism is described and 
   the comparison with the existing one [1]-[3] is shown. 

   When the MN is booting, it sends a Router Information Request 
   message using all routers multicast address to current subnet in 
   order to acquire network information about all ARs, ARs' IP 
   addresses, prefix lengths, and identifiers. In response to Router 
   Information Request message, the current AR (CAR) on the current 
   subnet sends a Router Information Reply message using the RIT.
   Then, the MN receives this reply message and caches the RIT in this
   reply message. Note that this Router Information Reqeust/Reply is 
   performed once only at the booting time and thus isn't performed in 
   real-time communication.
   
   Assume that the MN communicates with the corresponding node (CN). 
   In real-time communication, when the MN moves, the "trigger" may
   arrive from specific L2 events that might determine the need for 
   handover. In this draft, this trigger itself is not specified in 
   detail. Since this trigger is based on MOB_NBR-ADV given by BS, the
   MN can know the ARID of its BS from the trigger. Then, the MN checks 
   this ARID using the RIT cached previously, in order to determine 
   whether the MN changes BS or AR. If the MN changes BS, it continues 
   real-time communication via the CAR. Otherwise, the MN finds the
   new AR (NAR) corresponding to ARID from the RIT, and formulates a 
   new care-of address (NCoA) using the prefix of the NAR's address.

   On the other hand, in the existing mechanism [1]-[3], once a new BS 
   is detected through the reception of MOB_NBR-ADV containing
   the BS identifier (BSID), the MN tries to learn the associated AR 
   information. Thus, the MN sends a Router Solicitation for a Proxy 
   (RtSolPr) message to the CAR in order to acquire network information 
   of the NAR in real-time communication. To response to RtSolPr 
   message, the CAR finds the network information about the NAR 
   corresponding to BSID from the RIT, and sends a Proxy Router 
   Advertisement (PrRtAdv) message with the network information about 
   the NAR to the MN. Note that these RtSolPr and PrRtAdv are performed 
   even if the MN changes BS without change of AR. Then, the MN receives 
   this reply message and determines whether the MN changes BS or AR. 
   If the MN changes BS, it continues real-time communication via the 
   CAR. Otherwise, the MN formulates a NCoA using the prefix of the 
   NAR's address.
   
   After then, in both the proposed mechanism and the existing one, the 
   MN associates its current CoA (CCoA) with NAR's IP address for 
   forwarding purposes using a Fast Binding Update (FBU). Then, the CAR 
   sends a Fast Binding Acknowledgment (FBACK) message to the MN and 
   the NAR. The FBACK message confirms whether NCoA could be used, only 
   after which the MN must use NCoA on the new subnet. At this time, 
   the CAR sends a Handover Initiate (HI) message to NAR, after looking 
   up the IP address corresponding to ARID supplied by the MN using its 
   RIT. This FBU/FBACK and HI/HACK allows that packets arriving at the

Internet-Draft  Fast Handover for Mobile IPv6 Based IEEE802.16e June 2006

   CAR can be tunneled to the NAR. When the MN has confirmed its NCoA 
   and then completes the Binding Update procedure with its CN, the MN 
   continues real-time communication with the CN using  NCoA as its 
   source IP address via the NAR. 

6.  Advantages over Existing Mechanism

   The proposed mechanism provides several advantages over the existing 
   one in [1]-[3]. As mentioned in Section 5, the proposed mechanism can 
   omit RtSolPr/PrRtAdv messages used in the existing one, in real-time 
   communication. The proposed mechanism provides the faster acquisition 
   of NAR's network information than the existing one, which might be 
   advantageous for the low L3 handover latency. In addition, the 
   omission of above two messages might reduce amount of traffic in 
   comparison with the existing one, which might be remarkable when 
   there are many mobile nodes that are now connecting to the CAR. 
   Moreover, in the proposed mechanism, the MN can know whether it 
   changes AR or BS, while the existing one cannot. Thus, when the MN 
   changes BS, the proposed mechanism can remove redundant traffic of 
   the existing one. However, when there are many ARs on the 
   IEEE 802.16e wireless network, the size of the RIT may increase. 
   Then, the more memory is required for the MN to cache the RIT, which 
   may be a weak point of the proposed mechanism.
