Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements      February 2007


1.  Introduction

   Low-power wireless personal area networks (LoWPANs) are formed by
   devices complying to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard [1].  LoWPAN devices
   are distinguished by their low bandwidth, short range, scarce memory
   capacity, limited processing capability and other attributes of
   inexpensive hardware.  In this document, the characteristics of nodes
   participating in LoWPANs are assumed to be those described in [2].

   IEEE 802.15.4 networks support star and mesh topologies and consist
   of two different device types: reduced-function devices (RFDs) and
   full-function devices (FFDs).  RFDs have the most limited
   capabilities and are intended to perform only simple and basic tasks.
   RFDs may only associate with a single FFD at a time, but FFDs may
   form arbitrary topologies among each other and accomplish more
   advanced functions, such as multi-hop routing.

   Neither the IEEE 802.15.4 standard nor the "IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4"
   [3] specification provide any information as to how mesh topologies
   could be obtained and maintained.  However, routing in mesh networks
   has been the subject of much research in the IETF.  A number of
   experimental protocols have been developed in the Mobile Ad-hoc
   Networks (MANET) working group, such as AODV [4], OLSR [5], or DYMO
   [6].

   This document defines the problem statement of mesh routing in LoWPAN
   environments and outlines the relevant design goals and requirements.

1.1.  Scenario Considerations

   Low-power WPAN technology is still in its early stage of development,
   but the range of conceivable usage scenarios is tremendous.  The
   numerous possible applications of sensor networks make it obvious
   that mesh topologies will be prevalent in LoWPAN environments and
   routing will be a necessity for expedient communication.

   In general, the requirements on a routing protocol are depending on
   the hardware parameters of the participating nodes and the properties
   of the network;

   1.  Network properties:

       *  Device number and density

       *  Network scale and topology

       *  Mobility issues




Kaspar, et al.           Expires August 29, 2007                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements      February 2007


       *  ... etc.

   2.  Node parameters:

       *  Physical dimensions

       *  Hardware Cost

       *  Processing speed and memory size

       *  Power consumption and source

       *  Transmission range, rate and bandwidth

       *  ... etc.

   Network properties may vary arbitrarily for application scenarios in
   both LoWPAN or MANET contexts.  For instance, even though LoWPANs are
   often regarded as more dense and consisting of more nodes than MANET
   networks, it might as well occur that a MANET consists of more
   devices than a LoWPAN.

   On the other hand, the node parameters themselves define whether a
   certain node is a LoWPAN device, a MANET device or neither of both.
   The classification boundaries are only vaguely defined.  However, it
   is clear that pure LoWPAN devices enable services that MANET devices
   can not provide because of their nature of being more expensive,
   occupying greater physical space or requiring too much battery power.
   We might think that the characteristics of LoWPANs are device
   features only, but they enable a whole new segment of services that
   MANET devices are not always able to satisfy.  And for implementing
   these specialized LoWPAN services, the reuse of routing protocols
   tailored for MANET purposes might not suffice.

2.  Problem Statement

   If possible, the easiest way to achieve LoWPAN mesh routing is by
   reusing existing MANET protocols without making any modifications.
   However, the modification or simplification of existing MANET routing
   protocols may be required for mesh routing to be feasible in a LoWPAN
   domain, because other requirements apply to LoWPAN devices.  Unlike
   MANET devices, LoWPAN nodes are characterized by much lower power
   supplies, smaller memory sizes, and lower processing power, which
   creates new challenges on obtaining robust and reliable mesh routing
   within LoWPANs.

   Therefore, the modification and simplification of existing mesh
   routing protocols have to be done in such a way as to ensure
   efficient and robust packet delivery within LoWPAN networks.  This
   document also outlines the fundamental design goals, which mesh
   routing will intend to accomplish for LoWPANs.

   There exists a trade-off relationship between routing effectiveness
   and the requirements posed upon the devices participating in a mesh
   network.  The challenge is to create a balance between protocol
   simplicity and routing performance.  But stripping down existing
   protocols to power-aware, low-overhead protocols decreases the
   efficacy and functionality of their sophisticated routing techniques,
   or possibly even endangers the goals they were designed for.

3.  LoWPAN Mesh Routing Design Goals

   This section outlines the fundamental design goals, which mesh
   routing implementations will intend to accomplish for LoWPANs.

3.1.  Reuse of Existing MANET Protocols

   If the application of MANET routing protocols is feasible in LoWPAN
   environments, existing specifications should be simplified and
   modified to the smallest extent possible, in order to fit their low-
   power requirements.

3.2.  Adaptation Layer Routing

   Because network layer routing imposes too much overhead for LoWPANs
   and link layer techniques are out of scope of IETF, LoWPAN mesh
   routing should be performed within the adaptation layer defined in
   [3].

3.3.  Minimizing Overhead and Complexity

   Because energy-efficient routing is important in LoWPANs, control
   messages must be trimmed from overhead to the highest degree
   possible.  Routing overhead must be minimized in order to prevent
   fragmentation of frames on the physical layer, reducing the energy
   required for transmission and preventing the need for packet
   reassembly.

   Routing protocols should be designed to minimize the required number
   of control messages, memory size and computational complexity.
   Possible techniques might include the omission of routing tables or
   local repair procedures, but the actual details are left to the
   protocol designers.

3.4.  Power Conservation

   Saving energy is crucially important to LoWPAN devices that are not
   mains-powered but have to rely on a depleting source, such as a
   battery.  The lifetime of a LoWPAN node depends on the energy it can
   store and harvest.

   Compared to functions such as performing memory operations or taking
   sensor samples, radio communications is by far the dominant factor of
   power consumption [7].  Therefore, optimization of mesh routing
   protocols in terms of achieving a minimal number of control messages
   is essential for the longevity of battery-powered nodes.

   Many nodes in LoWPAN environments might periodically hibernate (i.e.



Kaspar, et al.           Expires August 29, 2007                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements      February 2007


   disable their transceiver activity) to save energy.  Therefore, mesh
   routing protocols must ensure robust packet delivery despite of nodes
   frequently shutting off their radio transmission interface.

   In order to find energy-optimal routing paths, LoWPAN mesh routing
   protocols should minimize power consumption by utilizing the link
   quality indication (LQI) provided by the MAC layer.

3.5.  Reliability and Robustness

   An important characteristic of LoWPAN devices is their unreliability
   due to limited system capabilities, and also because they might be
   closely coupled to the physical world with all its unpredictable
   variation, noise, and asynchrony.

   It is predicted that LoWPANs will be comprised of significantly
   higher numbers of devices than counted in current networks, causing
   user interaction and maintenance to become impractical and therefore
   requiring robustness and self-healing capabilities in their
   fundamental network structure.

   Mesh routing must be aware of unreliable nodes.  One method to
   estimate the reliability of a node is to use the link quality
   indication (LQI) provided by the MAC layer.

   Route repair and route error messages should be avoided for
   minimizing the overall number of control messages and the required
   energy for sending them.

   Loop-freedom is a desirable property of any routing protocol.

3.6.  Connectivity

   IP routing between LoWPAN domains and higher layer networks must be
   provided bidirectionally.  A LoWPAN mesh routing protocol must allow
   for gateways to forward packets out of the local domain and it must
   be possible to query a LoWPAN device from outside of the local
   domain.

   Strategies must be considered to avoid battery depletion of nodes by
   too many queries from higher level networks.  End-to-end
   communication is not a design goal of LoWPAN.

3.7.  Neighbor Discovery

   Neighbor discovery is a major precondition to allow routing in a
   network.  Especially in a low-power environment, where nodes might be
   in periodic sleeping states, it is difficult to define whether a node



Kaspar, et al.           Expires August 29, 2007                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements      February 2007


   is a neighbor of another or not.  In addition to that, LoWPAN devices
   must be very economical in terms of power consumption and should
   avoid sending "Hello" messages.  Instead, link layer mechanisms (such
   as acknowledgments or beacon responses) could be utilized to keep
   track of active neighbors.

3.8.  Bootstrapping

   Bootstrapping a LoWPAN network may be a prerequisite for mesh
   routing.

3.9.  Mobility

   Routing must be allowed both for fixed and dynamically adaptive
   topologies.  Mesh networks are likely to consist of nodes with a
   certain degree of mobility.  Due to the low performance
   characteristics of LoWPAN devices, fast mobility detection will be a
   huge challenge.  Nodes might even change their location while being
   in state of hibernation.  Routing must be robust and remain energy-
   efficient in all such cases.

   Also, as recently seen in discussions related to MANEMO (Network
   mobility for MANET), a similar point was stated regarding network
   mobility in LoWPAN environments.

3.10.  Scalability

   Low-power WPAN topologies are foreseen to comprise of significantly
   more devices than current networks.  Therefore, the design of mesh
   routing protocols must consider the fact that packets are to be
   reliably delivered over a much higher number of hops, too.

3.11.  Addressing

   Both addressing modes provided by the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, 16 bit
   short addresses and 64 bit extended addresses, must be considered by
   LoWPAN mesh routing protocols.

   It is assumed that nodes participating in LoWPAN mesh routing are
   assigned a single address/identifier and do not support multiple
   interfaces.

3.12.  Security

   Security threats within LoWPANs may be different from existing threat
   models in MANET environments.  Neighbor Discovery in IEEE 802.15.4
   links may be susceptible to threats as listed in RFC3756 [8].
   Bootstrapping may also impose additional threats.  Nevertheless,

Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements      February 2007


   security should not cause significant transmission overhead.

3.13.  Implementation Considerations

   Even though implementation details are out of IETF scope, due to the
   hardware restrictions of LoWPAN devices, code length should be
   considered to fit within their small memory size.

   LoWPANs;

      R01: Protocol control messages must not create fragmentation of
      PHY layer frames.

      R02: Shortest path calculation must be based on minimal energy
      usage.

      R03: Connectivity to higher layer networks must be provided by
      seamless IP routing.

      R04: Routing must be aware of sleeping nodes.

      R05: The solution must be simple and robust, despite of unreliable
      or sleeping nodes.

      R06: The solution must allow for dynamically adaptive topologies.
      It may support local mobility and global mobility.

      R07: The solution should support self-organization on deployment.

      R08: Neighbor discovery should be based on link layer mechanisms.

      R09: The solution should support high scalability.

      R10: Protocol control messages must be secured (TBD).
