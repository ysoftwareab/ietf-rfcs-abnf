	   1. Introduction 

		  This document defines an IPPM measurement signature suitable for 
		  performing the measure of the current IPPM metrics, for integrating 
		  those used by manufacturers and for allowing the IPPM WG to define 
		  other measurement signature in the future. 



	   2. Motivations and Goals 

			 Despite the growing availability of good measurement platforms, it 
		  is still impossible to generalize IPPM metrics measurement among 
		  heterogeneous points of measure. To do so, the extra information 
		  inserted in the IP packets to perform the measurement has to be 
		  standardized. 

		  There is a need for interoperability among heterogeneous manufacturer 
		  equipments to measure the performance of IP networks for different 
		  Type-P. 

		  This effort is motivated too by the need to perform end-to-end 
		  measures across administrative areas and composite networks. 
		  Currently there are only two solutions. The first one consists in the 
		  concatenation of end-to-end metrics. As these measures are not 
		  performed simultaneously and the test packets metered are different 
		  and the accuracy of the concatenation is extremely variable. The 
		  second one ICMP use is generalized but does not allow the description 
		  of the different Type-P needed in the measurement packets. 

		  The standardization of the access to the results of the measure of 
		  the metrics defined by the IPPM WG is a 'work in progress'. The proxy 
		  mode of the IPPM Reporting MIB provides a system of measure with an

		  exchange point for the results of the measure. One limitation is the 
		  incapacity to generalize end-to-end measures. The main reason is the 
		  lack of standard measurement packets. 

		  This memo analyses the state of the art in the domain, then it 
		  defines a framework for the standardization of the measurement 
		  packets. Finally it proposes and motivates a definition for a 
		  measurement packet signature. 

	   3. The IPPM Framework 

		  The IPPM Framework consists in 4 major components: 

			   + A general framework for defining performance metrics, 
			   described in the Framework for IP Performance Metrics, RFC 2330; 

			   + A set of standardized metrics, which conform to this 
			   framework. The IPPM Metrics for Measuring Connectivity, RFC 2678 
			   [2]. The One-way Delay Metric for IPPM, RFC 2679 [3]. The One-
			   way Packet Loss Metric for IPPM, RFC 2680 [4]. The Round-trip 
			   Delay Metric for IPPM, RFC 2681 [5]; 

			   + Emerging metrics which are being specified in respect of this 
			   framework; 

			   + A Reporting MIB to exchange the results of the measures. It is 
			   an interface between a system of measure and the administrative 
			   entities interested in these results. This proxy controls the 
			   access to the results. These entities use the results to compute 
			   statistics and aggregated metrics. 


	   4. Terminology 

	   4.1. IP measurement packet definition 

	   A measurement packet is a regular Internet packet that contains 
	   additional fields needed for measurement inserted somewhere in the 
	   packet. 

	   4.2. IPPM measurement signature definition 

	   An IPPM measurement signature is a regular Internet packet that contains 
	   a standard block of fields needed for performing IPPM measure. 

	   This block of fields is named IPPM measurement signature (IMS). 

	   The type of the Internet packet determines the Type-P of the measure.  

	   5. State of the art 


	   Stephan          Informational - Expires December 2002         [Page 3] 


	   Internet Draft          IPPM measurement packet               June 2002 


		  As Internet is designed for 'best effort' the specifications do not 
		  include the control of the quality of service provided. 


		  The IPPM WG has started an effort to standardize the protocols for 
		  measuring the performance of the network.  

		  It encounters 2 main issues. The measurement packets must not be easy 
		  to detect by the network equipments and must be easy to detect by 
		  measurement tools. The standard solution must be easy to implement 
		  and must not be a security hole. 

		  This section analyses the existing solutions and extracts the common 
		  parts to provide inputs for a first proposal. 

	   5.1. ICMP 

		  ICMP if the only test packet that is standardized. There is no doubt 
		  that it is dramatically used. On the other hand ICMP has serious 
		  limitations. Basically it cannot emulate type-P like UDP or TCP. 

	   5.2. Type-P 

		  The Type-P corresponds to the suite of protocols present in the IP 
		  and SUB IP headers of the packet. 

		  Software based devices inserts the data needed for the measure after 
		  the header of the packets. That increases the speed of software 
		  processing in the source and in the sink. The additional fields 
		  needed for measurement differs according to the Type-P. Typically its 
		  contents changes when fields of the packet header are used as data 
		  for the measurement. Moreover its location in the packet changes 
		  according to the Type-P. That makes it difficult to receive and 
		  timestamp the test packets at wire time. This technique is not 
		  adapted to high-speed rate. 

		  At high-speed rate (e.g. over OC12), hardware based devices insert 
		  the data needed for the measure in a fixed block of fields located at 
		  the end of the packet. That simplifies dramatically the design 
		  because the measurement data are located in the regular part of the 
		  packets. It generalizes the concept of Type-P for IPng, SUB IP and 
		  permit operational interoperability among heterogeneous SUB IP links. 
		  On the receiver's side it facilitates the detection of the test 
		  packet at wire speed, the time stamping of the packet on the fly and 
		  finally the extraction of the test signature. 

	   5.3. Wire time and time stamping 

		  This IPPM framework defines the wire time of a packet inserted on the 
		  network as the time that the last bit of the packets is sent.  


	   Stephan          Informational - Expires December 2002         [Page 4] 


	   Internet Draft          IPPM measurement packet               June 2002 


		  Most of the hardware implementations insert the timestamp on the fly 
		  and complement the binary value of the packet in a timestamp 
		  complement field. The delay between the timestamp insertion and the 
		  packet insertion on the wire is deterministic. The timestamp inserted 
		  is increased by the value of this delay while preserving the accuracy 
		  of the timestamp. This technique is generalized for link rate over 
		  gigabit/s. It is very accurate but requires larger field. 

		  Software devices do not share a common technique. The timestamp is 
		  inserted at different places, at different time according to the 
		  implementation and the operating system. There is not a common 
		  technique to adjust the timestamp value. The delay between the 
		  timestamp insertion and the packet insertion on the wire is not 
		  deterministic and introduces an initial jitter. 

	   6. Requirements 

	   6.1. Existing measurement fields 


		  IPPM measurement systems share the same semantic. The information 
		  inserted in the packet is very closed. The measurement packets differ 
		  only by the fields order, the field name, the field unit, the field 
		  size. 

		  The common fields are the following:  

			   The device that has sent the packet; 
			   The interface that has sent the packet; 
			   The identifier of the stream the packet belongs to; 
			   The absolute timestamp corresponding to the time the packet is 
			   sent; 
			   The sequence number of the packet; 
			   The absolute timestamp corresponding to the time the packet is 
			   received; 
			   A checksum computed on the previous fields; 
			   One-complement of timestamp; 

	   6.2. OWAMP requirements 

		  The IPPM WG is standardizing a measurement protocol. The requirements 
		  are listed in the "A One-way Active Measurement Protocol 
		  Requirements" (draft-ietf-ippm-owdp-reqs-01.txt). The test protocol 
		  needs to have the following characteristics: 

			 +  Be lightweight and easy to implement. 

			 +  Be suitable for implementation on a wide range of measurement 
		  nodes. 



	   Stephan          Informational - Expires December 2002         [Page 5] 


	   Internet Draft          IPPM measurement packet               June 2002 


			 +  Since the protocol needs to be able to measure individual 
		  packet delivery time and has to run on various machines, it needs to 
		  support UDP as transport protocol. 

			 +  It should be possible to use varying packet sizes and network 
		  services, as negotiated using OWDP-Control. 

			 +  To be a lowest common denominator, OWDP-Test packet format 
		  should only include universally meaningful fields, and minimum number 
		  of them. 

			 +  It should be possible to make packets generated by OWDP-Test as 
		  small as possible, to be able to accurately measure paths where 
		  packet-splitting technologies such as ATM are used. 


	   6.3. Interoperability requirements 

	   The requirement is to have operational interoperability among 
	   heterogeneous manufacturers and to perform one-way delay measurement 
	   across administrative areas and among composite networks.  

	   The constraints to gain inter domain interoperability and 
	   interoperability between heterogeneous manufacturers devices does not 
	   differ. 

	   The meaning of the common fields has to be adapted to the 
	   interoperability context. In a test involving heterogeneous equipments 
	   the values set up by the source have no meaning for the sink. The 
	   meaning of the administrative fields must be set by an entity common to 
	   the source and the sink. A field value sets by the source has no meaning 
	   for the sink excepted if the value refer to a shared referential. A 
	   typical example is the need to create a referential for the time.  

	   The issue does not consist only in having the IMS format to be 
	   recognized. The main need is to have the results of the measurement 
	   packets to be assigned to the same measure setup in the sink and in the 
	   source. The measure must be identified in the IMS. It must include a 
	   field that identifies the measure in the scope of the initiator of the 
	   measure.  

	   6.4. SUB IP and IPNG needs  

	   The measurement packet must consider the measure of the performance of 
	   multicast services, mobile IP services and Ipv6. The protocol 
	   translation mechanisms and the coexistence between Ipv4 and Ipv6 are 
	   potential sources of interoperability of the measures. 

	   6.5. Relationship with other organization

	   Internet Draft          IPPM measurement packet               June 2002 


	   The aim is to increase operational interoperability. Basically it 
	   consists in promoting the need to share the same measurement packets 
	   identification mechanism to unambiguously detect the measurements 
	   packets and avoid overlapping regarding the fields' values chosen. 

	   7. IPPM Measurement signature framework 

		  The aim is to provide a standard signature of the packet to perform 
		  measurements of the IPPM metrics across administrative areas and 
		  among heterogeneous devices. 

		  The framework has the following requirements: 


		  + Respects the IPPM Framework requirements (RFC2330) regarding the 
		  Type-P and the accuracy; 

		  + Respects the requirements for the test protocol of OWAMP; 

		  + Specifies a format that allows the integration of the future needs;  

		  + Specifies a test packet format for including the IMS in regular 
		  packets; 

		  + Integrates the existing test packets format and concepts whenever 
		  it is possible. 

	   The requirements and the needs may be gathered in a strong constraint: 
	   to have operational interoperability among heterogeneous manufacturers 
	   and to perform one-way delay measurement across administrative areas for 
	   the different Type-P, including those that have short packet-length 
	   constraints. 

	   The basic Type-P are obviously UDP and TCP. 

	   7.1. Measurement packet identification 

	   To distinguish measurement packets among regular packets, the last field 
	   of the IMS is a protocol identifier. 

	   7.2. RFC2330 Type-P 

	   The header of the packet defines the type-P of the test packet from the 
	   network point of view. 

	   7.3. RFC2330 Wire time and time stamping 

	   There is a strong requirement in the IPPM framework to have a timestamp 
	   consistent with the time the packet is inserted on the network. The 
	   specification must not increase the complexity of the time stamping at 
	   multi gigabit rates.

	   Internet Draft          IPPM measurement packet               June 2002 




	   7.4. IPPM measurement signature format 

	   It permits the IPPM WG to define several versions of the measurement 
	   packets. 

	   7.5. State machine limitation 

	   To guaranty operational interoperability the model is stateless excepted 
	   for semantic needs such as packet sequence order and security.  

	   That does not preclude the definition of more complex test packets in 
	   the future. 

	   7.6. Packet sequence number 

	   More and more services cross gateways. They may change the sequence 
	   numbering of the packets in the header (e.g. the initial value). A lot 
	   of metrics computation relies on the analysis of the order of the 
	   packets. To provide a trustable sequence of results there is a need for 
	   the sequence number to be integrated in the IMS.  


	   7.7. Measure initiator scope 

	   The management framework of the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB defines a namespace 
	   for each initiator (owner) of a measure. Each measure is identified by 
	   its owner and by the number chosen by the initiator for this measure 
	   within its scope. These values provides to the source and sink with a 
	   shared identifier. This field is mandatory to discriminate concomitant 
	   measures set up between 2 points measures. It permits different 
	   initiators to set up measures between 2 point of measures while 
	   concerning different metrics and Type-P.  

	   8. Discussion on IMS and OWAP base formats 

	   Measures performed with a timestamp resolution under the second are out 
	   of the scope of this memo. 

	   The OWAMP timestamp format reduces the maximal resolution of the NTP 
	   timestamp to improve the accuracy of operational measure of performance 
	   and to permit an efficient interoperability of the measure. It reuses 
	   the MSB of the 'fractional part of the second' field to carry both the 
	   source clock precision and the source synchronization state.  

	   Its resolution, ~50ns excludes ipdv measures on gigabit networks. As an 
	   example, consider the measure of IPDV of small packets (or cells) on the 
	   next generation of gigabit link, the 40G. The timeslot of such a packet 
	   is closed to 10 nanoseconds (400 bits* 1/40 ns). With such a timer 
	   resolution the first variation metered will correspond to 5 times the 

	   Stephan          Informational - Expires December 2002         [Page 8] 


	   Internet Draft          IPPM measurement packet               June 2002 


	   size of the packet itself. It means that the jitter will be computable 
	   only for packet of which the size is over 400 bytes. That excludes most 
	   of the real time applications, such as VoIP. 

	   The proposed timestamp is respectful of the OWAMP timestamp design while 
	   preserving the maximal resolution of the NTP timestamp format. It 
	   permits a timestamp resolution suitable for the measure over multi 
	   gigabit path. It preserves the NTP timestamp format. It differs because 
	   it counts the second since 1 Jan 2000 0H00 instead of 1 Jan 1900 0H00. 
	   It will wrap in year 2068 (The NTP timestamp will wrap in year 2036).  

	   As it does not count the second of the last century, the most 
	   significant bit of the part that represents the second is not needed for 
	   counting the second. It is set to indicate if the fractional part of the 
	   second contains a precision field. When this bit is not set the 
	   resolution is maximal. The maximal resolution is closed to 250 
	   picoseconds (see NTP RFC).  

	   The field Prec has the same semantic than in OWAMP. Its definition 
	   differs because it counts only the trusted bits of the fractional part 
	   of seconds. 

	   The field S is 3 bits long to describe the current level of clock 
	   synchronization (Status 0 to 7+). 

	   The proposal is to define a common packet signature format common to the 
	   OWAP test packet and to IMS. It is directly inspired from the 
	   'unauthenticated test packet' defined for the OWDP. This base is 
	   enhanced to define different types of IMS and to define the different 
	   type of OWAP test packets. 

	   It permits top define up to 16 different type and up to 4 versions. 
	   Currently that is enough both for IMS and OWAP needs and for the future. 

	   It is 12 bytes length.

	   10. Proprietary extension 

		  Manufacturers may insert proprietary extension at the beginning of 
		  the IMS while preserving measurement interoperability. The field 
		  'Ext' indicates the number of blocks of 8 bytes, which carried 
		  proprietary data. 

		  Example: 

		  An measurement point that need an 5 bytes of extra information to 
		  been inserted in an interdomain IMS use the following format: 

		   0                   1                   2                   3

	   11. Software and hardware techniques interoperability 

		  Both hardware and software solutions used the header of the packet to 
		  define the type-P, insert an IMS in the payload of the packets. They 
		  differ on the location of the IMS in the packet. 

		  It is obvious that interoperability between software and hardware 
		  technique will be reached when they will use the standardized IMS 
		  with no extra data in the type-P SDU. 


	   The maximum interoperability is gained when the type-P packet PDU 
	   consists only of the IMS. 


	   12. Security

	   To avoid the measurements systems to be used to make attacks there is a 
	   strong requirement to propose a security mechanism to control the access 
	   to the setup of the network measures.  

	   From the network security point of view, the main security hole in a 
	   network measure is the control test packet. The standardization of a 
	   packet signature does not facilitate the control of a probe to perform a 
	   DOS attack.
