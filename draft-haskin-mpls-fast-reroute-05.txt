  1. Introduction 
    
   The ability to quickly reroute traffic around a failure or 
   congestion in a label switched path (LSP) can be important in 
   mission critical MPLS networks. When an established label switched 
   path becomes unusable (e.g. due to a physical link or switch 
   failure) data may need to be re-routed over an alternative path. 
   Such an alternative path can be established after a primary path 
   failure is detected or, alternatively, it can be established 
   beforehand in order to reduce the path switchover time. 
    
   Pre-established alternative paths are essential where packet loss 
   due to an LSP failure is undesirable. Since it may take a 
   significant time for a device on a label switched path to detect a 
   distant link failure, it may continue sending packets along the 
   primary path.  As soon as such packets reach a switch that is aware 
   of the failure, packets must be immediately rerouted by the switch 
   to an alternative path away from the failure if loss of data is to 
   be avoided.  Since it is impossible to predict where failure may 
   occur along an LSP tunnel, it might involve complex computations and 
   extensive signaling to establish alternative paths to protect the 
   entire tunnel. In the extreme, to fully protect an LSP tunnel, 
   alternative paths might be established at each intermediate switch 
   along the primary LSP. 
    
   This document defines a method for setting alternative label 
   switched paths with the objective to provide a single failure 
   protection in such a manner that facilitates quick restoration 
   comparable to 50 milliseconds provided in SONET self-healing rings 
   and at the same time minimizes alternative path computation 
   complexity and signaling requirements. It also can provide in-band 
   means for quick detection of link and switch failures or congestion 
   along a primary path without resorting to an out of band signaling 
   mechanism. Both one-to-one (1:1) protection and many-to-one (1:N) 
   protection can be achieved with the proposed approach as described 
   in this document.

   In order for the presented method to work, it is important that 
   network topology and policy allow the establishment of a backup LSP 
   between the endpoint switches of the protected LSP tunnel such that, 
   with the exception of the tunnel endpoint switches, the backup LSP 
   does not share any resources with the path that it intends to 
   protect. 
    
   The fast reroute support can be facilitated with additional 
   extensions incorporated in the MPLS signaling protocols such as RSVP 
   or CR-LDP. These extensions are not defined in this document. 
    
    
  2. Alternative Path Arrangement 
    
   The main idea behind the presented method is to reverse traffic at 
   the point of failure of the protected LSP back to the source switch 
   of the protected LSP such that the traffic flow can be then 
   redirected via a parallel LSP between source and destination 
   switches of the protected LSP tunnel. 
    
   Referring to Figure 1, there is an MPLS network consisting of 7 
   interconnected switches.

   The following terminology is used for purpose of describing the 
   method: 
    
   A portion of a label switched path that is to be protected by an 
   alternative path is referred as 'protected path segment'.  Only 
   failures within the protected path segment, which may include the 
   entire primary path, are subject to fast reroute to the alternative 
   path. A primary LSP between switches 1 and 7 is shown by a double-
   dashed links labeled 13, 35, and 57. Arrows indicate direction of 
   the data traffic. 
    
   The switch at the ingress endpoint of the protected path segment is 
   referred as 'the source switch'. Switch 1 in Figure 1 is the source 
   switch in our example of a protected path.

Internet Draft  draft-haskin-mpls-fast-reroute-05.txt   November 2000 

    
   The switch at the egress endpoint of the protected path segment is 
   referred as 'the destination switch'. Switch 7 in Figure 1 is the 
   destination switch in our example of a protected path. 
    
   The switches between the source switch and the destination switch 
   along the protected path are referred as protected switches. 
    
   The switch immediately preceding the destination switch along the 
   protected path segment is referred as the last hop switch. Switch 5 
   in Figure 1 is the last hop switch for the protected path. 
    
   The essence of the presented method is that an alternative 
   unidirectional label switched path is established in the following 
   way: 
    
     The initial segment of the alternative LSP runs between the last 
     hop switch and the source switch in the reverse direction of the 
     protected path traversing through every protected switch between 
     the last hop switch and the source switch. The dashed line between 
     switches 5 and 1 illustrates such a segment of the alternative 
     path.  Alternatively, the initial LSP segment can be set from the 
     destination switch to the source switch in the reverse direction 
     of the protected path traversing through every protected switch 
     between the destination switch and the source switch. The dashed 
     line between switches 7 and 1 illustrates the initial path segment 
     that is set in this way. 
      
     The second and final segment of the alternative path is set 
     between the source switch and the destination switch along a 
     transmission path that does not utilize any protected switches. It 
     is not an intention of this document to specify procedures for 
     calculating such a path. The dashed line between Switches 1 and 7 
     through Switches 2, 4, and 6 illustrates the final segment of the 
     alternative path. 
    
   The initial and final segments of the alternative path are linked to 
   form an entire alternative path from the last hop switch to the 
   destination switch. In Figure 1 the entire alternative path consists 
   of the LSP links labeled 53, 31, 12, 24, 46, and 67 if the 
   alternative path originates at the last hop switch. Alternatively, 
   the entire alternative path consists of the LSP links labeled 75, 
   53, 31, 12, 24, 46, and 67 if the alternative path originates at the 
   destination switch of the primary path. 
    
   As soon as a failure along the protected path is detected, an 
   operational switch at the ingress of the failed link reroutes 
   incoming traffic around the failure or congestion by redirecting 
   this traffic into the alternative LSP traversing the switch in the 
   reverse direction of the primary LSP according to the procedures 
   described in the following sections of the document.

   The presented method of setting the alternative label switched path 
   has the following benefits: 
    
     - Path computation complexity is greatly reduced. Only a single 
       additional path between the source and destination switches of 
       the protected path segment needs to be calculated.  Moreover, 
       both primary and alternative path computations can be localized 
       at a single switch avoiding problems that can arise when 
       computations are distributed among multiple switches. 
   
     - The amount of LSP setup signaling is minimized. With small 
       extensions to RSVP or LDP (described in separated documents), a 
       single switch at ingress of the protected path can initiate 
       label allocations for both primary and alternative paths. 
   
     - Optionally, presence of traffic on the alternative path segment 
       that runs in the reverse direction of the primary path can be 
       used as an indication of a failure or congestion of a downstream 
       link along the primary path.  As soon as the source switch 
       detects the reverse traffic flow, it may stop sending traffic 
       downstream of the primary path and start sending data traffic 
       directly along the final alternative path segment. 
    
       It is fair to note that this technique increases the likelihood 
       of data packet reordering during the path rerouting process. 
       Therefore benefits of the reducing the alternative path latency 
       should be weighed against possible problems associated with 
       short term packet reordering. On a positive side, if multiple 
       microflows are aggregated in a single protected LSP tunnel, only 
       a very limited number of microflows may be affected by such 
       packet reordering. Additionally, the impact of reordering on any 
       single microflow may be minimal. 
 
   The described in-band signaling of an LSP failure to the source 
   switch does not exclude other methods of propagating an error 
   condition back to the source. 
    
   It also can be noted that if the alternative label switched path is 
   originated at the destination switch of the primary path, it forms a 
   'loop-back' LSP that originates and terminates at this switch. 
   Therefore in this case it is possible to verify integrity of the 
   entire alternative path by simply sending a probe packet from the 
   destination switch along the alternative path and asserting that the 
   packet arrives back to the destination switch.  When this technique 
   is used to assert the path integrity, the care must be taken that 
   the limited diagnostic traffic is not interpreted as an indication 
   of a primary path failure that triggers data rerouting at the source 
   switch.

  3. 1:1 protection 
    
   If the 1:1 path protection is desired, an individual backup LSP is 
   set for each LSP that needs to be protected as described in section 
   2. When a switch detects that a downstream link has failed, it 
   simply splices the traffic onto the alternative LSP. Referring to 
   Figure 1, if the link between the Switch 3 and Switch 5 fails, 
   Switch 3 accomplishes the fast reroute by swapping the incoming MPLS 
   label 13 of the primary path with the outgoing MPLS label 31 of the 
   alternative path. In this example the primary and alternative paths 
   are linked at Switch 3 forming the following label switched path for 
   the traffic flow: 13->31->12->24->46->67. 
    
    
  4. 1:N protection 
    
   In the case of the 1:N protection a single alternative path can be 
   used for protection of more than one LSP between the same source and 
   destination switches. The difference in rerouting LSPs the 1:N 
   protection case is that, rather than splicing protected traffic into 
   the alternative LSP, it may be necessary to use the MPLS label 
   stacking to tunnel protected traffic via the backup LSP to the 
   destination switch as described below. 
    
   A switch detecting failure of a downstream link, first swaps the 
   incoming MPLS label of each protected LSP with the respective 
   incoming label that identifies that LSP at the destination switch 
   and then pushes the outgoing label of the backup LSP to the top of 
   the forwarded MPLS packets. In essence, the protected MPLS packets 
   are encapsulated inside of the backup LSP and emerge at the backup 
   tunnel tail at the egress switch with their respective labels known 
   to that switch. 
    
   Referring to Figure 1 and assuming that global label space is used 
   at the destination switch, if the link between the Switch 3 and 
   Switch 5 fails, Switch 3 swaps incoming MPLS label 13 of the 
   protected LSP with label 57 (incoming label at Switch 7) and then 
   encapsulates the resulting packet into the backup tunnel by pushing 
   label 31 to the top of the forwarded MPLS packets. 
    
   Needless to say in order for this scheme to work, each router in the 
   protected path must be aware what labels are used at the egress LSR 
   for each protected LSP. Such knowledge can be propagated with the 
   appropriate extensions incorporated into signaling protocols such as 
   RSVP or CR-LDP. 
    
   A single segment of a tunnel between source and destination switches 
   can be used to protect multiple LSP segments that originate and 
   terminate on these switches as long as this segment of the backup 
   tunnel is completely disjoint from each protected LSP segment except 
   for the source and destination switches. In such a case the reverse 
   segments of backup path merge into the disjoint segment of the 
   backup path at the source switch of the protected LSPs as

   protected LSPs and double-dashed lines represent backup LSP tunnels.

  5. Restoration Shortcuts 
    
   Some types of applications require bounded end-to-end transmission 
   delays to deliver useful services. A notable example is the Voice 
   over IP (VoIP) service which requires end-to-end delays that do not 
   exceed 400 ms for an acceptable level of service. VoIP is also a 
   prime candidate for the fast reroute services. Since most of the 
   voice codecs in use today operate in the range of 20-50 ms latency, 
   the network component is left with around 300 ms of the end-to-end 
   delay limit. 
    
   Given the above considerations, it is important that, when 
   restoration provisions are made for a delay sensitive service, 
   transmission delays over an alternative path would not exceed an 
   acceptable limit. Since a number of the current network providers 
   are capable to guarantee network transport delay that do not exceed 
   80 ms on their backbone, it appears that in some cases it will be 
   possible to use the proposed restoration technique with a single 
   alternative path. It allows for at most 200 ms round trip delay over 
   a reverse path segment plus at most 100 ms delay over a disjoint 
   backup path segment. However in other cases it may be necessary to 
   introduce restoration shortcuts as described below to satisfy the 
   VoIP latency requirement during restoration. 
    
   Restoration shortcuts are achieved by allowing selected transit 
   routers in the primary LSP to establish one or more 'shortcut' 
   alternative LSPs to the egress router as illustrated in Figure 3. In 
   this illustration, primary link failures that may occur downstream 
   of LSR B are rerouted over the shortcut LSP from LSR B to the 
   destination of LSP being backed  up. In illustrated example the 
   shortcut LSP merges into the backup LSP at LSR D.

  6. Elementary link level protection scheme 
    
   If only link-level protection is desired, an alternative path 
   between link endpoints can be set up to protect each link. Such a 
   scheme can be viewed as a degenerate case of this proposal in which 
   the link endpoints constitute the source and destination endpoints 
   in the described approach. 
    
    
  7. Bandwidth Reservation Considerations 
    
   Generally there is no need to exclusively allocate bandwidth 
   resources to the alternate LSP. The holding priority of the primary 
   LSP can be used as traffic-triggered resource preemption priority 
   for the alternate LSP in case the primary LSP fails and traffic is 
   switched to the alternate LSP as described in this document. What we 
   call here the traffic-triggered priority is the preemption priority 
   assigned to an LSP that is utilized only when there is traffic 
   present on that LSP. When there is no traffic, other LSPs sharing 
   the interface should get full access to bandwidth and other system 
   resources. Consequently, if the traffic-triggered priority of the 
   alternative LSP is greater than the holding priorities of the other 
   LSPs using an interface in the alternate path, the alternate LSP can 
   preempt bandwidth and other system resources as soon as traffic gets 
   rerouted via the alternate LSP. This enables high-priority LSPs, 
   which are being rerouted, to preempt resources from lower priority 
   LSPs without explicit bandwidth reservation for the alternate path. 
   Of course, if bandwidth efficiency is not an issue, bandwidth 
   resources can be explicitly reserved for the alternate LSP also. 
    
   An extension to existing signaling protocols such as RSVP and LDP 
   may be needed to indicate that traffic-triggered resource preemption 
   is requested for a particular LSP as opposed to the setup priority 
   preemption.
