<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document analyses the main issues related to IPv4 Internet
      access in the context of public IPv4 address exhaustion. It would be
      valuable to assess IPv4 address shortage solutions with all these
      issues, to check to what degree they are concerned, how they handle each
      issue, and to what extent they resolve the pending problems.

Introduction</h3>

<p>Taking into consideration the IPv4 public address pool currently
      available at the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), it is
      expected that the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) will have no more
      public IPv4 addresses to allocate in the short term. At the time of
      writing, this anticipated date is mid-2012. See the IPv4 Address Report
      website www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html for a thorough analysis of
      this issue, and an updated prediction.
</p>
<p>At the exhaustion date, ISPs will wind up with public address pools
      that cannot grow. They will have to make do with what they have
      currently got. They will enter an IPv4 address shortage management
      phase. It will not be possible to provide each customer with a unique
      public IPv4 address. On the other hand, offering only an access to the
      IPv6 Internet won't be satisfactory for the customers because a lot of
      services will remain IPv4-only accessible (a full IPv6 world requires
      universal adoption which is hard to achieve).
</p>
<p>This document analyses the main issues related to IPv4 Internet
      access in the context of public IPv4 address exhaustion.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Shared IPv4 Addresses</h3>

<p>So far, the current practice has been to give a unique IPv4 public
      address to each customer. Current designs assume the allocation of a
      global IPv4 address to the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), whereas
      hosts connected to the CPE will be privately-addressed, meaning CPE
      devices activate a Network Address and Port Translator (NAPT) capability
      by default, sourcing IPv4 traffic based upon this sole global IPv4
      address. In this context, the addresses that can be seen in any IP
      packets always refer to a unique customer. To cope with the IPv4 address
      exhaustion, this kind of practices is no more affordable. Therefore ISPs
      are bound to allocate the same IPv4 public address to several customers
      at the same time.
</p>
<p>All IPv4 address shortage mechanisms extend the address space in
      adding port information. They differ on the way they manage the port
      value. In this new context, an IPv4 address seen in an IP packet can
      refer to several customers. The port information must be considered as
      well, in order to be able to unambiguously identify the customer pointed
      by that shared address. In particular, the port information along with
      the address information, must eventually be taken into account by the
      routing infrastructure in order to correctly reach the intended
      destination.
</p>
<p>So far, two categories of solutions have been identified: (1)
      Solutions that propose the introduction of a NAPT function in the ISP
      network, denoted also as Carrier Grade NAT (CGN). The CGN is responsible
      for translating IP packets issued with private addresses to ones with
      publicly routable IPv4 addresses. (2) Solutions that avoid the presence
      of a CGN function, they allocate the same IP public address to several
      customers at the same time. They also allocate a restricted port range
      to each customer so that two customers with the same IP address have two
      different port ranges that do not overlap.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Address Space Multiplicative Factor</h3>

<p>The purpose of sharing IPv4 addresses is to potentially increase the
      addressing space. A key parameter is the factor by which ISPs want or
      need to multiply their IPv4 public address space; and the consequence is
      the number of customers sharing the same public IPv4 address.
</p>
<p>The intention is not to replace IPv6. However, we should be very
      careful; whatever the network model deployed, applications and business
      will run on top of it. If we do not want to see IPv4 shortage mechanisms
      postpone IPv6 deployment, all Internet actors must adopt a voluntary
      position towards IPv6.
</p>
<p>It is expected that IPv6 traffic will take an increasing part during
      the next years to come, at the expense of IPv4 traffic. We should reach
      a safety point in the future, where the number of IPv4 public addresses,
      in use at the same time, begins decreasing. From an ISP point of view,
      the multiplicative factor must be enough to survive until this occurs
      for its own customers. Most likely, a one digit factor (less than 10)
      should be sufficient, and it should be pointless to go beyond. Whereas
      the potential is huge, -if we allow to each customer (one IP address,
      1000 ports) we multiply by 64 the total IPv4 address space- trying to
      devise solutions that can increase the IPv4 space by a significantly
      bigger factor might be seen as an incentive to postpone again and again
      IPv6 deployment.

<a name="rfc.section.4"></a><h3>4.&nbsp;
Service Management</h3>

<p>At the time of IPv4 address exhaustion in the RIRs, ISPs will have to
      manage public address pools that cannot grow (at least from the RIRs).
      Concretely, they will have to decide to whom they allocate shared
      addresses and to whom they allocate unique addresses, to the extent of
      the availability of addresses. Many policies can be envisaged, taking
      into account parameters such as: old vs. new customers, user profile,
      access type, geographic considerations, unique address as the privileged
      choice, shared address as the privileged choice, etc. An important issue
      is whether shared and unique addresses will be differently charged.
</p>
<p>Care must be taken when considering the ratio that reflects the
      number of customers who will share a given global IPv4 address, not only
      to preserve some flexibility on the global address space that is left,
      but also to make sure that the ISP can adequately serve customer's
      requirements, without degrading the services they have subscribed to.
      ISPs can adjust the volume of IPv4 public addresses available playing on
      the balance between shared and unique allocations. </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>To increase the public IPv4 address pool: increase the number of
          customers with shared address; increase the ratio of customers per
          shared address.
</li>
<li>To decrease the public IPv4 address pool: decrease the number of
          customers with shared address; decrease the ratio of customers per
          shared address.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="rfc.section.5"></a><h3>5.&nbsp;
IPv6 Migration and IPv4-IPv6 Coexistence</h3>

<p>Any IPv4 address shortage solution should make use, as much as
      possible, of the IPv6 transport capabilities available, in order to
      increase the IPv6 packets traffic and to move forward from an
      IPv4-enabled ISP network towards an almost only IPv6-enabled ISP
      network. If it is not the case, the risk is to delay IPv6 deployments,
      in staying on a pure dual-stack attitude for ever, similar to the ships
      in the night routing approach, where the protocols independently live
      their own lives.
</p>
<p>The IPv4 in IPv6 tunnels, and/or the translation NAT464 should be
      favored. However, increasing the number of IPv6 packets does not
      automatically mean IPv6 is being generalized, if the main purpose of
      these packets is to carry IPv4 information. This is very similar to what
      occurred with ATM, especially in European countries, where ATM cells
      have heavily been used to convey IPv4 packets in the backhaul networks,
      but have never been used for end-to-end communications.
</p>
<p>If the percentage of end-to-end IPv6 traffic significantly increases,
      so that the volume of IPv4 traffic begins decreasing, then the number of
      IPv4 sessions will be decreasing. The smaller the number of current
      sessions per customer is, the higher the number of customers under the
      same IPv4 public address can be, and consequently, the lower the number
      of IPv4 public addresses is needed. Hence, the pressure on IPv4 address
      shortage would be relaxed, because one IPv4 public address would be able
      to potentially serve more customers. However, this effect will only
      occur for customers who have both an IPv6 access and a shared IPv4
      access. This would advocate the strategy to systematically bound a
      shared IPv4 access to any IPv6 access. Furthermore, some public IPv4
      addresses will be required to connect IPv4 and IPv6 realms, through IPv4
      IPv6 translators, for the sake of global reachability.

Network Addressing Capability</h3>

<p>The network addressing capability is the level of flexibility the
        network has to configure customers' devices, either with a unique
        address, or with a shared IPv4 address. It can be assessed through the
        following considerations:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Is it possible to configure any customer's device with a shared
            address, regardless his location and his history?
</li>
<li>Is it possible to configure any customer's device with a unique
            public address, regardless his location and his history?
</li>
<li>Is it straightforward to switch, for any customer, from a
            shared address to a unique public address, and vice versa?
</li>
</ul><p>What is considered here is not the policy decision to
        allocate a unique or a shared address, but indeed the network
        capability to enforce such address management schemes.

Number of Current Sessions per Customer</h3>

<p>In any kind of solutions, the number of current sessions per
        customer has, de facto, to be limited in some way. Therefore, the
        number of current sessions per customer is a limit to take into
        account in any architectural dimensioning. The degree of fairness
        -balanced distribution of sessions between customers-, should be
        assessed. Means to prevent against traffic loss (due to the limitation
        in number of sessions) should be evaluated and proposed. The
        importance of this issue may be greatly reduced if the multiplicative
        factor is very small (e.g. 4).
</p>
<p>As for the current usage of ports, several hundreds per customer
        seems current practice, although several thousands may be not unusual
        with some P2P applications (e.g. BitTorrent).
</p>
<p>The impact of the dynamicity of the sessions should also be
        considered, especially as far as performance is concerned.

Scarcity of Private Addressing</h3>

<p>As a matter of fact, private IPv4 addresses (as defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC1918'>[RFC1918]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rekhter, Y., Moskowitz, R., Karrenberg, D., Groot, G., and E. Lear, &ldquo;Address Allocation for Private Internets,&rdquo; February&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a>) belong to a finite space which may rapidly
        raise overlapping issues as both the number of customers and the
        number of services that can be subscribed by these customers increase.
        As a consequence, some ISPs use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) such
        as <a class='info' href='#RFC4364'>[RFC4364]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosen, E. and Y. Rekhter, &ldquo;BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> to allow reusing the same private
        addresses several times with no routing overlaps. This brings a lot of
        complexity in network configuration and management.
</p>
<p>It has been suggested to make the 240/4 block available for private
        addressing <a class='info' href='#I-D.wilson-class-e'>[I&#8209;D.wilson&#8209;class&#8209;e]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Wilson, P., Michaelson, G., and G. Huston, &ldquo;Redesignation of 240/4 from &quot;Future Use&quot; to &quot;Private Use&quot;,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. This address
        block, formerly designated as "Class E", is still noted as being
        reserved in the IANA IPv4 address registry. If it were reassigned for
        private addressing that would yield around 268 millions extra private
        addresses. However, many current implementations of the TCP/IP
        protocol stack do not allow the use of the 240/4 block. This is a
        severe blocking point for a lot of existing devices: CPE, NAT or
        routers. This issue will only be solved when the vendors'
        implementations accept the (240/4) addresses.
</p>
<p>Another suggestion <a class='info' href='#I-D.shirasaki-isp-shared-addr'>[I&#8209;D.shirasaki&#8209;isp&#8209;shared&#8209;addr]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Yamagata, I., Miyakawa, S., Nakagawa, A., Yamaguchi, J., and H. Ashida, &ldquo;ISP Shared Address,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> is to reserve some
        public blocks (typically three or four /8) only for internal usage. So
        far, there has been no consensus upon this proposal.
</p>
<p>What needs to be considered is to what extent the IPv4 sharing
        solutions make use of IPv4 private addresses.

        evaluated and assessed.
</p>
<p>Common practice used to rely upon the global IPv4 address assigned
        to a CPE device for customer identification purposes. The forthcoming
        address depletion therefore encourages ISPs to revisit their customer
        identification schemes since global IPv4 addresses will be shared
        amongst several customers. This clearly advocates for an IPv6-based
        customer identification scheme and thus impacts the way
        customer-specific management policies are enforced.
</p>
<p>The possibility to give either a unique or a shared address,
        coupled or not with an IPv6 address, could yield several types of
        customers to deal with in the IS: IPv4 unique only, IPv4 shared only,
        IPv4 unique + IPv6, IPv4 shared + IPv6, IPv6 only. The way the
