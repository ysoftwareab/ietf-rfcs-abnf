1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in
   [draft-openconfig-netmod-opstate-01]:

   o  intended configuration - this data represents the state that the
      network operator intends the system to be in.  This data is
      colloquially referred to as the 'configuration' of the system.

   o  applied configuration - this data represents the state that the
      network element is actually in, i.e., that which is currently
      being run by particular software modules (e.g., the BGP daemon),
      or other systems within the device (e.g., a secondary control-
      plane, or line card).

   o  derived state - this data represents information which is
      generated as part of the system's own interactions.  For example,
      derived state may consist of the results of protocol interactions
      (the negotiated duplex state of an Ethernet link), statistics
      (such as message queue depth), or counters (such as packet input
      or output bytes).

2.  Requirements

   1.  Ability to interact with both intended and applied configuration

       A.  The ability to ask the operational components of a system
           (e.g., line cards) for the configuration that they are
           currently using.  This is the "applied configuration".

       B.  Applied configuration is read-only

       C.  The data model for the applied configuration is the same as
           the data model for the intended configuration (same leaves)

       D.  For asynchronous systems, when fully synchronized, the data
           in the applied configuration is the same as the data in the
           intended configuration.

   2.  Applied configuration as part of operational state

       A.  The ability to retrieve the applied configuration and derived
           state nodes in a single protocol operation.

   3.  Support for both transactional, synchronous management systems as
       well as distributed, asynchronous management systems

       A.  For asynchronous systems, the ability to request a protocol
           operation to not return (i.e. block) until the intended
           configuration has been fully synchronized.

       B.  The protocol operation's response would indicate the result
           of the operation (success, failure, partial, etc.)

   4.  Separation of configuration and operational state data; ability
       to retrieve them independently

       A.  Be able to retrieve only the derived state aspects of
           operational state

       B.  Be able to retrieve only the non-derived state aspects of
           operational state

   5.  Ability to retrieve operational state corresponding only to
       derived values, statistics, etc.

          // this is a duplicate of # 4-a

   6.  Ability to relate configuration with its corresponding
       operational state

       A.  Ability to map intended config nodes to corresponding applied
           config nodes

       B.  Ability to map intended config nodes to associated derived
           state nodes

       C.  The mappings needs to be programmatically consumable

   7.  Ability for distinct modules to leverage a common model-structure

       A.  Scope is limited to IETF-defined modules

       B.  Multiple domain-specific trees are okay

       C.  Multiple namespaces are okay

3.  Security Considerations

   None

4.  IANA Considerations

   None

5.  Acknowledgements

   TBD

Appendix A.  Relation to Requirements in Other Drafts

   The requirements in this document roughly map onto the requirements
   listed in [draft-openconfig-netmod-opstate-01] and
   [draft-openconfig-netmod-model-structure-00] as list below.  Some
   liberty was taken to adjust the requirements based on what looked
   liked consensus from on list discussions:

   1.  draft-openconfig-netmod-opstate-01, Section 3

   2.  draft-openconfig-netmod-opstate-01, Section 4.1

   3.  draft-openconfig-netmod-opstate-01, Section 4.2

   4.  draft-openconfig-netmod-opstate-01, Section 4.3

   5.  draft-openconfig-netmod-opstate-01, Section 4.4
