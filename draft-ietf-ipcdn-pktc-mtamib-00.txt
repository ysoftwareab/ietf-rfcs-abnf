1. Abstract  
    
   This memo is a draft document of the initial version of the 
   document. This document does not have any predecessors.  
      
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
   In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-
   based management of PacketCable 1.0 compliant Media Terminal 
   Adapter(MTA) devices.  
     
   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to 
   the SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7]. The set of objects are consistent with the 
   SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.

2. The SNMP Management Framework 
       
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
   components:  
    
. An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].  
    
. Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
  purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of 
  Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, 
  RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second 
  version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [5], STD 58, 
  RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].  
    
. Message protocols for transferring management information. The first 
  version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described 
  in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which 
  is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and 
  described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10]. The third version of the 
  message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 
  2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12]. 
    
. Protocol operations for accessing management information. The first 
  set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in 
  STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations and 
  associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

   Internet Draft   PacketCable MTA MIB    October 25, 2002 

. A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and the 
  view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [15].  
     
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management 
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [16]. 
     
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
     
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A 
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
   translations. The resulting translated MIB MUST be semantically 
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable 
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine 
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of 
   the MIB. 
    
    
3. Glossary  
   The terms in this document are derived either from normal 
   PacketCable 1.0 system usage, or from the documents associated with 
   the PacketCable 1.0 Provisioning Specification [17] and Security 
   Specification [18].  
  
3.1. DOCSIS 
   "Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification".  A term referring 
   to the ITU-T J.112 Annex B standard for cable modem systems [19]. 
    
3.2. CM   (Cable Modem)  
   A CM acts as a data transport agent used to transfer call management 
   and voice data packets over the DOCSIS compliant cable systems. 
    
3.3. MTA   (Media Terminal Adapter)

   providing telephony services over the cable or hybrid system used to 
   deliver video signals to a community. MTA can be Embedded (E-MTA) or 
   Standalone (S-MTA). E-MTA contains both an MTA and a CM. S-MTA does 
   not contain the CM part relying on the presence of some external 
   DOCSIS agent to provide the data transport over the cable. 
    
3.4. Endpoint  
   A standard RJ-11 telephony physical port located on the MTA and used 
   for attaching the telephone device to the MTA.

4. Overview  
   This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of 
   PacketCable compliant media Terminal Adapters (MTA). The 
   specification is derived in part 
   from the parameters described in PacketCable 1.0 Provisioning 
   Specification [17]. 
    
4.1. Structure of the MIB  
   This MIB is structured as three groups: 
    
. Management information pertinent to MTA Device Itself 
  (pktcMtaDevBase).  
. Management information pertinent to the Provisioning back office 
  Servers (pktcMtaDevServer). 
. Management information pertinent to elements of and logic providing 
  the PacketCable Security mechanisms (pktcMtaDevSecurity). 
     
   First two groups contain only scalar information describing the 
   corresponding characteristics of the MTA device and back office 
   servers.  
     
   Third group contains two tables controlling the necessary logical 
   associations between KDC realms and back office servers (CMS and 
   provisioning).  
     
   Rows in the tables can be created automatically (e.g. by the device 
   according to the current state information) or can be created by the 
   management station depending on the operational situation. Tables 
   may and generally will have a mixture of both types of rows.  
  
 pktcMtaDevBase  
   Contains management information describing the parameters of the MTA 
   device itself. Also, this group contains some objects controlling 
   the MTA state. Some of the MIB objects are as follows:  
     
   pktcMtaDevSerialNumber - Contains the MTA Serial Number.  
   pktcMtaDevMacAddress - Contains the MTA MAC address.

   Internet Draft   PacketCable MTA MIB    October 25, 2002 

   pktcMtaDevEndPntCount -  Contains the number of End Points present 
   in MTA.  
   pktcMtaDevProvisioningState - This object contains the information 
   describing the completion state of the initialization process.  
   pktcMtaDevEnabled - Controls the state of the MTA enabling or 
   disabling telephony services on the device.  
   pktcMtaDevResetNow - This object is used to instruct the MTA to 
   reset itself.  
      
 pktcMtaDevServer  
   Contains management information describing the back office servers 
   and the parameters assigned to the communication timeouts. Also, 
   this group contains some objects controlling the initial MTA 
   interaction with the Provisioning Server.   
    
   Some of the MIB objects are as follows:  
     
   pktcMtaDevServerDhcp1 - This object contains the IP Address of the 
   Primary DHCP server designated for MTA provisioning.  
   pktcMtaDevServerDhcp2 - This object contains the IP Address of the 
   Secondary DHCP server designated for MTA provisioning.  
   pktcMtaDevServerDns1 - This object contains the IP Address of the 
   Primary DNS used by MTA to resolve the FQDN and IP Addresses.  
   pktcMtaDevServerDns2 - This object contains the IP Address of the 
   Secondary DNS used by MTA to resolve the FQDN and IP Addresses.  
   pktcMtaDevConfigFile - This object contains the name of the 
   provisioning configuration file to download from the Provisioning 
   Server by the MTA.  
   pktcMtaDevProvConfigHash - This object is used to supply the hash 
   value of MTA Configuration File calculated over its content.  
      
 pktcMtaDevSecurity  
   Contains management information describing the security related 
   characteristics of the MTA.  
        
   Also, this group contains two tables containing logical dependencies 
   and parameters necessary to establish security association between 
   the MTA and other components of the back office.  
    
     pktcMtaDevRealmTable - This table is used in conjunction with any 
       server which needs a Security Association with an MTA (CMS or 
       Provisioning Sever).  
     pktcMtaDevCmsTable - This table contains the parameters describing 
       the SA establishment between an MTA and a CMS.   
4.2. Relationship between MIB Objects in MTA MIB 
   This section clarifies the relationship between various MIB Objects 
   in MTA MIB in respect to the role these objects are playing in the 
   process of the Security Association establishment. 
  
 Security Association Establishment Process  
   Relationships between the MTA MIB Objects are defined by the way how 
   the Security Association establishment process is defined by the 
   PacketCable Security Specification [18].  
        
   The SA establishment process between the MTA and other back office 
   Servers (CMS or Provisioning Server) consists of two steps:  
     
. AS-exchange providing mutual authentication of the parties (MTA and 
  the Server), 
. AP-exchange providing the Key Distribution between the parties (MTA 
  and the Server).  
     
   Each Server-MTA Security Association has a one-to-one correspondence

   Internet Draft   PacketCable MTA MIB    October 25, 2002 

   to a single Realm.   
  
 Realm Table to CMS Table Relationship  
   Realm Table contains the parameters defining the process of the AS-
   exchange between the MTA and the KDC when MTA is going to be 
   authenticated to either of the Severs - CMS or Provisioning. Realm 
   Table is indexed by the Realm Name. 
     
   CMS Table contains the parameters defining the process of the AP-
   exchange between the MTA and the CMS when MTA is exchanging the keys 
   for SA with CMS. CMS Table is indexed by the CMS FQDN.   
     
   CMS Table also contains the Realm Name corresponding to each CMS 
   FQDN (each row). This allows for multiple realms, each with its own 
   Security Association.  
  
 SA Related Scalar MIB Objects in MTA MIB  
   MTA MIB also contains the group of the scalar MIB Objects which 
   define the Parameters for AP-exchange process between the MTA and 
   the Provisioning Server. These objects are:  
     
. pktcMtaDevProvUnsolicitedKeyMaxTimeout  
. pktcMtaDevProvUnsolicitedKeyNomTimeout  
. pktcMtaDevProvUnsolicitedKeyMaxRetries  
. pktcMtaDevProvSolicitedKeyTimeout

        --  
        --     The realm must be configured first.  Associated with  
        --     the realm is a KDC.  The realm table  
        --     (pktcMtaDevRealmTable) indicates information about  
        --     realm (e.g., name, organization name) and   
        --     parameters associated with KDC communications (e.g.,  
        --     grace periods,  AS request/AS reply adaptive backoff

        --     Once the realm is established, one or more servers may 
        --     be defined in the realm.  For PacketCable 1.0, these are  
        --     Call Management Servers (CMSs). Associated with each CMS  
        --     entry in the pktcMtaDevCmsTable is an explicit reference  
        --     to a Realm via the realm index

        --      a different FQDN, the MTA checks the current CMS MAP   
        --      table entries for the affected endpoint.  If the entry   
        --      exists in the CMS MAP table, the current CMS MAP table   
        --      entry is marked inactive and the newly chosen CMS MAP   
        --      table entry is marked active.  
        --  
        --      If the entry does not exist in the CMS MAP table, the   
        --      CMS table is checked to determine whether or not it   
        --      contains the CMS specified by CMS signaling (possibly  
        --      a redirection).  If the desired CMS entry is defined,   
        --      then a corresponding entry is created and an entry in   
        --      the CMS MAP table is created.  If the MTA does not  
        --      have current associations with that CMS, it will now   
        --      perform key management to establish required security   
        --      associations. Once the desired CMS entry is  
        --      established, the current CMS MAP table entry is marked  
        --      inactive and the newly created CMS MAP table entry is  
        --      marked active. Otherwise the current CMS MAP table  
        --      entry remains active and the newly created CMS MAP  
        --      table entry is marked in active.

        --      If the entry does not exist in the CMS MAP table and  
        --      the CMS entry does not exist in the CMS table, a new  
        --      CMS table entry should be created.  This CMS entry  
        --      should use the same realm as used by this endpoint. The  
        --      default values for the clock skew and AP request/AP  
        --      reply adaptive backoff parameters should be used.  The  
        --      MTA will now perform key management to establish  
        --      required security associations. Once the desired CMS  
        --      entry is established, the current CMS MAP table entry  
        --      is marked inactive and the newly created CMS MAP table  
        --      entry is marked active. Otherwise the current CMS MAP  
        --      table entry remains active and the newly created CMS  
        --      MAP table entry is marked inactive.  
        --  
        -- III. When the MTA receives wake-up or re-key messages from a  
        --      CMS, it performs key management based on the  
        --      corresponding entry in the CMS table.  If the matching  
        --      CMS entry does not exist, it must ignore the wake-up or

9. Security Considerations  
   This MIB relates to a system which will provide metropolitan public 
   internet access.  As such, improper manipulation of the objects 
   represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a large 
   number of end-users.  In addition, manipulation of the Realm Table, 
   CMS Table, and several other vital MIB objects such as (not limited 
   to) PktcMtaDevConfigFile, pktccMtaDevProvConfigHash, 
   pktcMtaDevProvConfigKey, may lead to the theft of service or 
   significant disruption of the functionality of the MTA.    
     
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations.  
          
   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network 
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is 
   no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.  
          
   PacketCable 1.0 complaint MTA devices are required to implement 
   secure SNMPv3 access to MTA MIB. It is highly recommended that the 
   other Potential implementers will consider the security features as 
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the 
   User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View- based Access 
   Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.  
    
   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
   (change/create/delete) them.  
    
10.  Intellectual Property  
   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any 
   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to 
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in 
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights 
   might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it 
   has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the 
   IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and
