     2.  Abstract

     This  memo  defines a set of extensions which instrument RADIUS client
     functions. These extensions represent  a  portion  of  the  Management
     Information  Base  (MIB)  for use with network management protocols in
     the Internet community.  Using these  extensions  IP-based  management
     stations can manage RADIUS clients.


     3.  Introduction

     This  memo  defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
     for use with network management protocols in the  Internet  community.
     In  particular,  it describes managed objects used for managing RADIUS
     clients.

     Today a wide range of network devices, including  routers  and  NASes,
     act  as  RADIUS clients in order to provide authentication, authoriza-
     tion, and accounting services. As a result, the  effective  management
     of RADIUS clients is of considerable importance.

     4.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

     The  SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major compo-
     nents.  They are:

           o  RFC 1902 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
              describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

           o  RFC 1905 which defines the protocol used for network access to
              managed objects.

           o  RFC 1907 defines the core set of managed objects for the
              Internet suite of protocols.

           o  RFC 1909 which defines the administrative aspects of the
              framework.

     The Framework permits new objects to be defined  for  the  purpose  of
     experimentation and evaluation.


     4.1.  Object Definitions

     Managed  objects  are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
     the Management Information Base  or  MIB.   Objects  in  the  MIB  are
     defined  using  the  subset  of  Abstract  Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
     defined in the SMI. In particular, each object object type is named by
     an  OBJECT  IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
     type together with an object instance serves to  uniquely  identify  a
     specific  instantiation of the object. For human convenience, we often
     use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer  to  the  object
     type.


     5.  Overview

     This MIB module contains two scalars as well as a single table:

     (1)  the RADIUS Server Table contains one row for each
          RADIUS server that the client shares a secret with.

     Each entry in the RADIUS Server Table includes twenty entries present-
     ing a view of the activity of the RADIUS client.
