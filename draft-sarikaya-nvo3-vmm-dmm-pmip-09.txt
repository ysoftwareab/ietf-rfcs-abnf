         Virtual Machine Mobility Protocol for Overlay Networks
                draft-sarikaya-nvo3-vmm-dmm-pmip-09.txt

Abstract

   This document describes a virtual machine mobility protocol commonly
   used in data centers built with overlay-based network virtualization
   approach.  It is based on using a Network Virtualization Authority
   (NVA)-Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) protocol to update Address
   Resolution Protocol (ARP) table or neighbor cache entries at the NVA
   and the source NVEs tunneling in-flight packets to the destination
   NVE after the virtual machine moves from source NVE to the
   destination NVE.

1.  Introduction

   Data center networks are being increasingly used by telecom operators
   as well as by enterprises.  In this document we are interested in
   overlay-based data center networks supporting multitenancy.  These
   networks are organized as one large Layer 2 network geographically
   distributed in several buildings.

   Virtualization which is being used in almost all of today's data
   centers enables many virtual machines to run on a single physical
   computer or compute server.  Virtual machines (VM) need hypervisor
   running on the physical compute server to provide them shared
   processor/memory/storage.  Network connectivity is provided by the
   network virtualization edge (NVE) [I-D.ietf-nvo3-arch],
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-nve-nva-cp-req].  Being able to move VMs dynamically,
   or live migration, from one server to another allows for dynamic load
   balancing or work distribution and thus it is a highly desirable
   feature [RFC7364].

   There are many challenges and requirements related to migration,
   mobility, and interconnection of Virtual Machines (VMs)and Virtual

   Network Elements (VNEs).  Retaining IP addresses after a move is a
   key requirement [RFC7364].  Such a requirement is needed in order to
   maintain existing transport connections.

   In view of many virtual machine mobility schemes that exist today,
   there is a desire to define a standard control plane protocol for
   virtual machine mobility.  The protocol should be based on IPv4 or
   IPv6.  In this document we specify such a protocol.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-arch].

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC7364].  In addition
   we make the following definitions:

   Hot VM Mobility.  A given VM could be moved from one server to
   another in running state.

   Warm VM Mobility.  In case of warm VM mobility, the VM states are
   mirrored to the secondary server (or domain) at a predefined
   (configurable) regular intervals.  This reduces the overheads and
   complexity but this may also lead to a situation when both servers
   may not contain the exact same data (state information)

   Cold VM Mobility.  A given VM could be moved from one server to
   another in stopped or suspended state.

3.  Requirements

   This section states requirements on data center network virtual
   machine mobility.

   Data center network SHOULD support virtual machine mobility in IPv6.

   IPv4 SHOULD also be supported in virtual machine mobility.

   Virtual machine mobility protocol SHOULD not support host routes.
   Virtual machine mobility protocol SHOULD not support triangular
   routing.  Virtual machine mobility protocol SHOULD not need to use
   tunneling except for handling packets in flight.

4.  Overview of the protocol

   Being able to move Virtual Machines dynamically, from one server to
   another allows for dynamic load balancing or work distribution and
   thus it is a highly desirable feature.  In a Layer-2 based data
   center approach, virtual machine moving to another server does not
   change its IP address.  Because of this an IP based virtual machine
   mobility protocol is not needed.  However, when a virtual machine
   moves, NVEs need to change their caches associating VM Layer 2 or MAC
   address with NVE's IP address.  Such a change enables NVE to send
   outgoing MAC frames addressed to the virtual machine.

   Virtual machine moves from its source NVE to a new, destination NVE.
   The move is initiated by the source NVE and is in the same L2 link,
   the virtual machine IP address(es) do not change but this virtual
   machine is now under a new NVE, previously communicating NVEs will
   continue to send their packets to the source NVE.  Address Resolution
   Protocol (ARP) cache in IPv4 [RFC0826] or neighbor cache in IPv6 in
   the NVEs need to be updated.

   It takes a few seconds for a VM to move from its source NVE to the
   new destination one.  During this period, a tunnel is needed so that
   source NVE forwards packets to the destination NVE.

   In IPv4, the virtual machine immediately after the move sends a
   gratuitous ARP request message containing its IPv4 and Layer-2 or MAC
   address in its new NVE, destination NVE.  This message's destination
   address is the broadcast address.  NVE receives this message.  NVE
   should update VM's ARP entry in the central directory at the NVA.
   NVE updates NVA to record IPv4 address of VM along with MAC address
   of VM, and NVE IPv4 address.  An NVE-to-NVA protocol is used for this
   purpose [I-D.ietf-nvo3-arch].

   Reverse ARP (RARP) which enables the host to discover its IPv4
   address when it boots from a local server [RFC0903] is not used by
   VMs because the VM already knows its IPv4 address.  IPv4/v6 address
   is assigned to a newly created VM, possibly using Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP).

   All NVEs communicating with this virtual machine uses the old ARP
   entry.  If any VM in those NVEs need to talk to the new VM in the
   destination NVE, it uses the old ARP entry.  Thus the packets are
   delivered to the source NVE.  The source NVE MUST tunnels these in-
   flight packets to the destination NVE.

   When an ARP entry in those VMs times out, their corresponding NVEs
   should access the NVA for an update.

Internet-Draft            VM Mobility Solution                March 2016


   IPv6 operation is slightly different:

   In IPv6, the virtual machine immediately after the move sends an
   unsolicited neighbor advertisement message containing its IPv6
   address and Layer-2 MAC address in its new NVE, the destination NVE.
   This message is sent to the IPv6 Solicited Node Multicast Address
   corresponding to the target address which is VM's IPv6 address.  NVE
   receives this message.  NVE should update VM's neighbor cache entry
   in the central directory at the NVA.  IPv6 address of VM, MAC address
   of VM and NVE IPv6 address are recorded to the entry.  An NVE-to-NVA
   protocol is used for this purpose [I-D.ietf-nvo3-arch].

   All NVEs communicating with this virtual machine uses the old
   neighbor cache entry.  If any VM in those NVEs need to talk to the
   new VM in the destination NVE, it uses the old neighbor cache entry.
   Thus the packets are delivered to the source NVE.  The source NVE
   MUST tunnels these in-flight packets to the destination NVE.

   When a neighbor cache entry in those VMs times out, their
   corresponding NVEs should access the NVA for an update.

5.  Handling Packets in Flight

   Source hypervisor may receive packets from the virtual machine's
   ongoing communications and these packets should not be lost and they
   should be sent to the destination hypervisor to be delivered to the
   virtual machine.  The steps involved in handling packets in flight
   are as follows:

   Preparation Step  It takes some time, possibly a few seconds for a VM
      to move from its source hypervisor to a new destination one.
      During this period, a tunnel needs to be established so that
      source NVE forwards packets to the destination NVE.

   Tunnel Establishment - IPv6  Inflight packets are tunneled to the
      destination NVE using the encapsulation protocol such as VXLAN in
      IPv6.  Source NVE gets destination NVE address from NVA in the
      request to move the virtual machine.

   Tunnel Establishment - IPv4  Inflight packets are tunneled to the
      destination NVE using the encapsulation protocol such as VXLAN in
      IPv4.  Source NVE gets destination NVE address from NVA when NVA
      requests NVE to move the virtual machine.

   Tunneling Packets - IPv6  IPv6 packets are received for the migrating
      virtual machine encapsulated in an IPv6 header at the destination
      NVE.  Destination NVE decapsulates the packet and sends IPv6
      packet to the migrating VM.

Internet-Draft            VM Mobility Solution                March 2016


   Tunneling Packets - IPv4  IPv4 packets are received for the migrating
      virtual machine encapsulated in an IPv4 header at the destination
      NVE.  Destination NVE decapsulates the packet and sends IPv4
      packet to the migrating VM.

   Stop Tunneling Packets  When source NVE stops receiving packets
      destined to the virtual machine that has just moved to the
      destination NVE.

6.  Moving Local State of VM

   After VM mobility related signaling (VM Mobility Registration
   Request/Reply), the virtual machine state needs to be transferred to
   the destination Hypervisor.  The state includes its memory and file
   system.  Source NVE opens a TCP connection with destination NVE over
   which VM's memory state is transferred.

   File system or local storage is more complicated to transfer.  The
   transfer should ensure consistency, i.e. the VM at the destination
   should find the same file system it had at the source.  Precopying is
   a commonly used technique for transferring the file system.  First
   the whole disk image is transferred while VM continues to run.  After
   the VM is moved any changes in the file system are packaged together
   and sent to the destination Hypervisor which reflects these changes
   to the file system locally at the destination.

7.  Handling of Hot, Warm and Cold Virtual Machine Mobility

   Cold Virtual Machine mobility is facilitated by the VM initially
   sending an ARP or Neighbor Discovery message at the destination NVE
   but the source NVE not receiving any packets inflight.  Cold VM
   mobility also allows all previous source NVEs and all communicating
   NVEs to time out ARP/neighbor cache entries of the VM and then get
   NVA to push to NVEs or get NVEs to pull the updated ARP/neighbor
   cache entry from NVA.

   The VMs that are used for cold standby receive scheduled backup
   information but less frequently than that would be for warm standby
   option.  Therefore, the cold mobility option can be used for non-
   critical applications and services.

   In cases of warm standby option, the backup VMs receive backup
   information at regular intervals.  The duration of the interval
   determines the warmth of the standby option.  The larger the
   duration, the less warm (and hence cold) the standby option becomes.

   In case of hot standby option, the VMs in both primary and secondary
   domains have identical information and can provide services

Internet-Draft            VM Mobility Solution                March 2016


   simultaneously as in load-share mode of operation.  If the VMs in the
   primary domain fails, there is no need to actively move the VMs to
   the secondary domain because the VMs in the secondary domain already
   contains identical information.  The hot standby option is the most
   costly mechanism for providing redundancy, and hence this option is
   utilized only for mission-critical applications and services.

8.  Virtual Machine Operation

   Virtual machines are not involved in any mobility signalling.  Once
   VM moves to the destination NVE, VM IP address does not change and VM
   should be able to continue to receive packets to its address(es).
   This happens in hot VM mobility scenarios.

   Virtual machine sends a gratuitous Address Resolution Protocol or
   unsolicited Neighbor Advertisement message upstream after each move.

8.1.  Virtual Machine Lifecycle Management

   Managing the lifecycle of VM includes creating a VM with all of the
   required resources, and managing them seamlessly as the VM migrates
   from one service to another during its lifetime.  The on-boarding
   process includes the following steps:

   1.  Sending an allowed (authorized/authenticated) request to Network
       Virtualization Authority (NVA) in an acceptable format with
       mandatory/optional virtualized resources {cpu, memory, storage,
       process/thread support, etc.} and interface information

   2.  Receiving an acknowledgement from the NVA regarding availability
       and usability of virtualized resources and interface package

   3.  Sending a confirmation message to the NVA with request for
       approval to adapt/adjust/modify the virtualized resources and
       interface package for utilization in a service.

9.  Security Considerations

   Security threats for the data and control plane are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-arch].  This document does not introduce any new
   security threats.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request to IANA.
