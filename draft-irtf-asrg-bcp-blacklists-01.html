<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
DNS-Based Reputation Systems</h3>

<p>Due to the rising amount of spam and other forms of network abuse on
        the Internet, many community members and companies began to
        create and maintain DNS-based reputation systems ("DNSBL") of IP 
        addresses and domains identified as problem sources of email.  These
        lists also have been known as blocklists and blacklists.  These
        lists are used for filtering email.  DNSBLs are either public or
        private.  A public DNSBL makes its data available to any party
        seeking information about data on the list, but a private DNSBL
        is used solely by an organization for its own use and the data is 
        not made available publicly.  There are also commercial DNSBLs.
</p>
<p>The first publicly available DNSBL using the Domain Name System (DNS)
        for distributing reputation data about email senders emerged in 1997,
        shortly after spam became a problem for network operators and email
        administrators.  This pioneer DNSBL focused on identifying known 
        spam sources situated at static IP addresses.  Due to the broad 
        adoption of this DNSBL, it had a devastating impact on static spam 
        sources.  Consequently, abusers found other methods for distributing 
        their spam such as relaying messages through unsecured email servers 
        or flawed formmail scripts on web pages.  Additional DNSBLs were 
        developed by others in order to address these changing tactics, and 
        today more than 700 DNSBLs are in operation.
</p>
<p>These DNSBLs vary widely in integrity, strategy, methodology and stability. 
        While listing criteria can sometimes be quite controversial, this document
        deliberately does not discuss the rightness or wrongness of any criteria.  
        We assert that DNSBL operators are free to choose whatever listing criteria 
        they wish, as long as they're clear to their users what they are.  It is
        the responsibility of the DNSBL user to ensure that the listing criteria and
        other aspects of a DNSBL meets their needs.
</p>
<p>This document is also intended to provide guidance to DNSBL
        administrators so that they may be able to identify what features
        users would be interested in seeing as part of a high-quality, well-
        managed DNSBL, e.g., a clear listing and delisting policy to which
        the DNSBL administrator adheres strictly.  This document is intended 
        to be normative rather than prescriptive:  it seeks to characterize 
        the features of a well-managed DNSBL rather than setting out rules 
        for how DNSBLs should be operated.
</p>
<p>This document is not intended as a protocol specification of DNSBL
        queries.  See <a class='info' href='#DNSBL-EMAIL'>[DNSBL&#8209;EMAIL]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Levine, J., &ldquo;DNS-based Blacklists and Whitelists for E-Mail,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h3>1.2.&nbsp;
Guidance for DNSBL Users</h3>

<p>When choosing to adopt a DNSBL, an administrator should keep the
      following questions in mind:
</p>
<p>
      </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>What is the intended use of the list?
</li>
<li>Does the list have a web site?
</li>
<li>Are the list's policies stated on the web site?
</li>
<li>Are the policies stated clearly and understandably?
</li>
<li>Does the web site function properly, e.g., hyperlinks?
</li>
<li>Are web pages for removal requirements accessible and working properly?
</li>
<li>How long has the list been in operation?
</li>
<li>What are the demographics and quantity of the list's user base?
            In other words, do other sites like my own use this DNSBL?
</li>
<li>Are comparative evaluations of the list available?
</li>
<li>What do your peers or members of the Internet community say
            about the list?
</li>
</ol><p>
      
</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the system administrators who adopt one 
      or more DNSBLs to evaluate, understand, and make a determination of
      which DNSBLs are appropriate for the sites they administer.  If you
      are going to allow a third party to make blocking decisions for you,
      you MUST understand the policies and practices of those third 
      parties because responsibility for blocking decisions remain
      ultimately with you, the system administrator.  A DNSBL does not
      prevent anyone from receiving email or any other Internet service.
      A DNSBL *user* prevents service by means of a DNSBL.
</p>
<p>DNSBL administrators are merely expressing an opinion through the
      publication of a DNSBL, and it is their absolute right to do so
      free of legal encumbrance, even in violation of this BCP.  However,
      it is through abiding by the guidelines set forth in this BCP that
      the administrators of a DNSBL may gain the trust of their users.
</p>
<p>These guidelines only address public DNSBLs and do not apply to
      private access DNSBLs.

Transparency</h3>

<p>A DNSBL SHOULD carefully describe the criteria which are the cause
        for adding, and the criteria for removing an IP address or domain 
        name on the list.  Such listing and delisting criteria SHOULD be 
        presented in a clear and readable manner easily accessible to the 
        public on the DNSBL's web site. A DNSBL 
        MUST abide by its stated listing and delisting criteria.  Entries 
        that do not meet the published criteria MUST NOT be added to the
        DNSBL.

<p>In other words, be direct and honest and clear about the listing 
        criteria, and make certain that only entries meeting the published
        criteria are added to the list.  For example, some DNSBL operators
        have been known to include spite listings in the lists they
        administer.
        There is nothing inherently wrong with this practice so long as it
        is clearly disclosed.  For example, a DNSBL described as listing open
        relays only MUST NOT include IP addresses for any other reason.  This
        transparency principle does not require DNSBL administrators to
        disclose the precise algorithms and data involved in a listing.
</p>
<p>Availability of documentation concerning a DNSBL SHOULD NOT be
        dependent on the continued operation of DNS for DNSBL queries.
        
</p>
<p>In other words, if the DNSBL documentation is at "http://dnsbl.example.com",
        the documentation for the web site should not become unavailable if the
        DNSBL query name servers are not available (or shutdown).

Listings SHOULD Be Temporary</h3>

<p>With the exception of DNSBLs that are based on data that does not

        listings SHOULD be temporary so that an entry will time out at some

        In most cases it is appropriate to expire in days or a few weeks,
	  and 6 months is a sensible maximum (absent additional detections).
</p>
<p>Note that all listings being temporary does not mean that some
        listings will not remain after the initial timeout period. If the 
        DNSBL administrator determines that the conditions for listing 
        still exists, then the timer for determining timeouts can be 
        renewed.

A Direct Non-Public Way to Request Removal SHOULD Be Available</h3>

<p>Discussions about whether a DNSBL should remove an entry MAY 
        include activity in a public forum.  Methods for processing 
        removal requests through private, direct exchanges, such as 
        person-to-person email or a combination of web page requests 
        and email responses, SHOULD be available.  As a minimum, the 
        DNSBL SHOULD have a web page that has a removal request function 
        (separate from the page describing listing criteria as per 
        <a class='info' href='#listing_criteria'>Section&nbsp;2.1.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Listing/Delisting Criteria SHOULD Be Easily Available</span><span>)</span></a>).  The DNSBL SHOULD also make available an email 
        address to handle issues other than blocking issues.
</p>
<p>The DNSBL administrator MUST NOT use the list in question in such
        a way that removal requests would be blocked, and, moreover,
        SHOULD make unfiltered mailboxes available in order to allow 
        affected users to submit their requests.  In some cases it is 
        impractical not to filter email to role accounts due to the amount 
        of spam those mailboxes receive.  If filtering should be necessary
        in such circumstances, filtering methods with virtually non-
        existent false positive rates SHOULD be chosen.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2.3"></a><h3>2.2.3.&nbsp;
Removals SHOULD Be Prompt</h3>

<p>Requests for removal SHOULD be honored without question.
        Although this approach allows people to submit a request and have
        any listed IP address removed immediately, it does not prevent 
        the DNSBL administrator from re-listing the IP address at a 
        later time (for example: subject to seeing more spam, or 
        re-checking the IP address security). A re-listing MAY result in 
        a longer timeout until the listing expires before it is eligible 
        for removal.  Bounded exponentially extended periods
        is a good choice for 
        listing timeout.
</p>
<p>Assuming the above is not possible and no listing reasons remain,
        removal at anyone's request SHOULD be prompt.  Removal requests
        SHOULD be acted upon within a period of 24 hours, and SHOULD be
        handled within three (3) days.
</p>
<p>Most DNSBLs can effectively use a "no questions asked" removal 
        policy because by their very nature they will redetect or relist 
        problems almost immediately.  They can mitigate more organized 
        attempts to "game" the system by elementary checking and rate-
        limiting procedures, increasing lockout periods, rescans etc.
        Furthermore, a few IP addresses more or less do not make a
        significant difference in the overall effectiveness of a DNSBL.
        Moreover, a "no questions asked" removal policy provides the 
        huge benefit of a swift reaction to incorrect listings.
</p>
<p>As an example, one popular DNSBL uses a "no questions asked" 
        removal policy, but does perform rate-limiting and malicious 
        removal detection.
</p>
<p>Another important consideration supporting a "no questions asked"
        self-removal policy is that it forestalls conflicts between DNSBL
        administrators and organizations whose IP addresses have been
        listed.  Such a policy also can be an effective deterrent to legal
        problems.

SHOULD Have Similar Criteria for Listing and Delisting</h3>

<p>The criteria for being removed from a DNSBL SHOULD bear a reasonable
        relationship to the factors which were the cause of the addition to
        the
        DNSBL.  If a listed entity fulfills all published requirements for
        removal from a DNSBL, then the DNSBL administrator SHOULD NOT 
        impose any additional obstacles to remove a given entry from
        the DNSBL.  There SHOULD NOT be any extra rules for de-listing
        other than the ones listed in the published listing criteria.
</p>
<p>In addition, it is RECOMMENDED that all listings SHOULD be temporary 
        as described in <a class='info' href='#temporary'>Section&nbsp;2.2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Listings SHOULD Be Temporary</span><span>)</span></a>. For temporary listings, it is not 
        necessary to correct the causes of the listing in order to be removed
        from the DNSBL.

DNSBL Query Root Domain SHOULD be a Subdomain</h3>

<p>By virtue of using domain names, a
        DNSBL is a hierarchy with a root anchored in the global Internet.

        The DNSBL "query root" SHOULD be below the registered domain, so 
        that the DNSBL information is not conflated with domain housekeeping 
        information (e.g., name server or MX records) for the domain.

        By using this 
        approach, DNSBL queries would take the form of 
        "&lt;query>.dnsbl.example.com" rather than "&lt;query>.example.com".

        Further, this sub-tree should have its own name servers.  Thus,
        the DNSBL query root has its own zone file containing the DNSBL
	  information, and the registered domain has its own name servers containing
	  the information (MX records etc.) for the domain.

        This approach 
        facilitates clear delineation of function as well as
        orderly DNSBL shutdown because the DNSBL nameserver records can be
        specified separately from the domain's principal nameservers.

<p>If the DNSBL offers zone transfers (in addition to or instead of standard DNSBL

DNSBLs SHOULD Provide Operational Flags</h3>

<p>Most DNSBLs follow a convention of entries for IPs in 
        127.0.0.0/8 to provide online indication of whether the DNSBL 
        is operational.  Many DNSBLs arrange to have a query
	  of 127.0.0.2 return an A record indicating that the IP is listed,
        and a query of 127.0.0.1 return no A record (NXDOMAIN). When both
	  of these indicators are present, this indicates
        that the DNSBL is functioning normally.  See <a class='info' href='#DNSBL-EMAIL'>[DNSBL&#8209;EMAIL]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Levine, J., &ldquo;DNS-based Blacklists and Whitelists for E-Mail,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.3.4"></a><h3>3.4.&nbsp;
Shutdowns MUST Be Done in a Graceful Fashion</h3>

<p>A number of DNSBLs have shut down operations in such a way as
	  to list the entire Internet, sometimes without warning.  These
	  were usually done this way to force DNSBL users (mail administrators)
	  to adjust their DNSBL client configurations to omit the now inoperative
	  DNSBL and to shed the DNS query load from the registered domain name servers.  
        Popular DNSBLs are in use by 10s
        of thousands of sites, are not well monitored, and often not compliant
	  with DNSBL query conventions (e.g.: will treat any A record return as being "listed",
        instead of specific 127/8 A record returns)
        hence shutdowns can be quite destructive to all email flow if not done
        properly.
</p>
<p>The DNSBL operator MUST issue impending shutdown
	  warnings (on the DNSBL web site, appropriate mailing lists, newsgroups,
	  vendor newsletters etc), and indicate that the DNSBL is inoperative using
	  the signalling given in <a class='info' href='#updown'>Section&nbsp;3.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>DNSBLs SHOULD Provide Operational Flags</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Only after these warnings have been issued for
	  a significant period of time (RECOMMENDED: one or more months), should the DNSBL operator finally
	  shutdown the DNSBL.
</p>
<p>The shutdown procedure should have the following properties:
	   </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>MUST NOT list the entire Internet
</li>
<li>SHOULD shed the DNSBL query load from the DNSBL name servers, permitting
	        the registered domain name to continue being useable.
</li>
<li>SHOULD, perhaps through increased delays, indicate to the
	        Mail administrator that the DNSBL is no longer functional.
</li>
<li>The base domain name SHOULD be registered indefinately, so as to
		  ensure that the domain name doesn't represent a "booby trap" for future
		  owners, and/or provide a means by which a new owner could list the entire
		  Internet.
</li>
</ol>

<p>One way of satisfying the points 1-3 above is to change the DNS name servers
	  for the DNSBL to point at "TEST-NET" addresses (see <a class='info' href='#RFC3330'>RFC3330<span> (</span><span class='info'>IANA, &ldquo;Special-Use IPv4 Addresses,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3330]).
	  The below suggested
	  <a class='info' href='#BIND'>[BIND]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Internet Systems Corporation, &ldquo;ISC BIND,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> declarations will cause a DNSBL query to query name servers in TEST-NET addresses, which
	  will result in a significant delay, but not return any A records except in very
	  unusual circumstances.
</p>
<p>BIND-equivalent DNS declarations for DNSBL shutdown.

Use of Collateral Damage MUST Be Disclosed</h3>

<p>Some DNSBLs have adopted a policy of using "collateral damage" as

        damage is applied, a DNSBL listing is expanded to include IP
        addresses
        under the control of a provider even though those IP addresses are
        not the source of abusive email.  The theory is that customers 
        impacted by collateral damage will apply pressure to the provider 
        to take action against the customer which is the cause of the
        original listing.
</p>
<p>Collateral damage as a DNSBL policy is highly controversial, and
        discussion of the appropriateness of this policy is beyond the scope
        of this document.  However, if a DNSBL has policies and practices

          of caution.

<p>Therefore, scanning MUST be be targeted, rather than broad-based, 
          where a given scan is motivated by a specific reason to have 
          concern about the address being scanned.  Examples of such reasons 
          include delivery to a spam trap address, receipt of a user complaint,

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>Any system manager that uses DNSBLs is entrusting part of his or her server
    management to the parties that run the lists.
    A DNSBL manager that decided to list 0/0 (which has actually happened) could cause every server
    that uses the DNSBL to reject all mail.
    Conversely, if a DNSBL manager removes all of the entries (which has
    also happened), systems that depend
    on the DNSBL will find that their filtering doesn't work as they want it to.
</p>
<p>If a registered domain used for a DNSBL is allowed to lapse, or the DNSBL user
    spells the DNSBL domain name incorrectly, the system manager's server management
    is now subject to an entirely different party than was intended.  Further, even if
    there is no malicious intent, some DNSBL query clients will interpret any A record
    being returned as being listed.
