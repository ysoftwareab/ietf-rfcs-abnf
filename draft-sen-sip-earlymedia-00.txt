Abstract 
   Once an INVITE is sent, an UAC should be able to handle incoming 
   media at anytime. Hence, a SIP terminal should be able to support 
   early media. However, there are some issues with the way session 
   descriptions (SDP) in provisional responses are handled, optional 
   use of resource reservation, complexity introduced by forked INVITEs 
   and interactions with NAT/Firewall traversal. This draft discusses 
   some of these issues along with related IP-PSTN inter-working 
   scenarios. 
    
1 Introduction 
    
   Early media is a concept of delivering a media stream prior to call 
   answer or session establishment. Normally, early media designates a 
   media transmission sent before the actual completion of the call. In 
   terms of SIP, early media refers to transmission of media prior to 
   response code 200 OK being sent to an Invite. 
    
   Early media is generally required to deliver inbound call progress 
   messages when inter-working with Public Switched Telephone Network 
   (PSTN) or Private Switched Telephone Network (i.e. PBX). In the 
 
Sen                                                                  1
                    Early Media Issues and Scenarios         July, 2001 
 
   PSTN, a one-way voice path is established to the caller by the 
   Address Complete Message (ACM). In the PBX, a one-way voice path is 
   established to the caller based on the presence of a Progress 
   indicator indicating in-band information. The one-way voice path is 
   used for transmitting early media, such as busy tone, reorder tone, 
   announcements etc. From SIP perspective, early media can also be 
   useful to avoid clipping of the backwards voice path when a call is 
   answered. This can happen because the audio media may 
   unintentionally arrive at the originating user agent ahead of a 200 
   OK response of an INVITE. 
    
   According to [4], SIP terminals should be ready to receive media any 
   time after sending an INVITE. Hence, a SIP terminal should be able 
   to support early media. However, there are some issues with the way 
   session descriptions (SDP) in provisional responses are handled, 
   optional use of resource reservation, complexity introduced by 
   forked INVITEs, interactions with NAT/Firewall traversal etc. This 
   draft discusses some of these issues along with related IP-PSTN 
   inter-working scenarios. Although most of the early media scenarios 
   discussed in this document refer to IP-PSTN inter-working, they are 
   applicable to other IP-IP scenarios as well. 
    
   Also note that, although many of the current SIP implementations do 
   not support the origination of early media, it is assumed that this 
   support will soon become an intrinsic feature of all SIP terminals. 
   This draft discusses issues in supporting early media when dealing 
   with SIP terminals.  
    
1.1 Terminology 
    
   Callee 
   Refers to the terminating host 
    
   Caller 
   Refers to the originating host 
    
   Media Gateway (MG) 
   The media gateway converts media provided in one type of network to 
   the format required in another type of network. For example, a MG 
   could terminate bearer channels from PSTN (e.g., DS0s) and media 
   streams from a packet network (e.g., RTP streams in an IP network). 
    
   Media Gateway Controller (MGC) 
   The media gateway controller controls the parts of the call state 
   that pertain to connection control for media channels in a Media 
   Gateway. 
    
   ISUP Initial Address Message (IAM) 
   This message is used to establish a connection on a specified 
   circuit. It includes all necessary information required for handling 
   ISUP call.

   ISUP Address Complete (ACM) 
   This message is considered as a response of an ISUP IAM. It 
   indicates that the call is being processed, and the distant exchange 
   is checking the availability of the called party. This could also 
   mean that called party is ringing/alerted. In PSTN, a one-way voice 
   path is established to the caller by the ACM message. This voice 
   path is used to carry voice announcements and to transmit tones.  
    
   ISUP Answer Message (ANM) 
   This is also sent in the same direction as ACM to indicate that the 
   called party has answered. 
    
   IP Terminal 
   The term used to represent all end-user devices that originate and 
   terminate SIP calls 
    
   PBX 
   A Private Branch Exchange is a private telephone switch. For the 
   purpose of this document, the protocol used by the PBX is assumed to 
   be Q.931 or a derivative (Q.SIG, etc.). 
    
   PSTN 
   This is the Public Switched Telephone Network. PSTN is also 
   sometimes referred as GSTN (General Switched Telephone Network). 
    
   PSTN Origination 
   An originator's ingress-MGC receives ISUP from the PSTN network. 
   This request is forwarded to SIP network either using SIP-T 
   mechanism or direct translation of parameters from received ISUP 
   message to a SIP method. 
    
   PSTN termination 
   A terminator's egress-MGC receives an INVITE from an IP terminal. 
   This request is forwarded to PSTN network either using SIP-T 
   mechanism or direct translation of parameters from received SIP 
   method to the ISUP message.  
    
   Q.931 SETUP message 
   This message is used to establish a connection on a specified 
   circuit. It includes all necessary information required for handling 
   ISDN calls. 
    
   Q.931 Progress indicator 
   A progress indicator can be included in a Q.931 CALL PROCEEDING, 
   PROGRESS or ALERTING message. If the value of the progress indicator 
   is #1, "Call is not end-to-end ISDN" or #8, "In-band information or 
   an appropriate pattern is now available", it means that in-band 
   tones and announcements (such as ringing or busy) may be provided by 
   the far end. 
    
   Q.931 ALERTING message

                    Early Media Issues and Scenarios         July, 2001 
 
   An ALERTING message indicates that the user is being alerted, and 
   that unless in-band tones and announcements are provided, local 
   ringing shall be provided. 
    
   Q.931 CONNECT message 
   A CONNECT message indicates that the called party has answered. 
    
2 Early Media Support in current version of SIP  
    
   Support of early media is implicit in the current version of SIP 
   [4]. Once an INVITE with SDP is sent, an UAC should able to handle 
   incoming media at anytime. According to [4]: "If a 1xx response 
   contains a session description, a UAC SHOULD cease generating local 
   ring-back tone." It also states: "The UAS can remove the media 
   stream by setting the port number to zero in a subsequent session 
   description contained in a provisional response and thus restore 
   normal ring-back behaviour." If 1xx is received without SDP, this 
   does not cause any change in the behaviour of the UAC. Also, [4] 
   mandates that for the UAS to send a provisional response with SDP, 
   the UAC need to send an INVITE with SDP. 
    
   The above way of notifying the UAC of the ensuing early media 
   session (i.e., with 18x containing SDP) will create problems for 
   PSTN inter-working as there is no way for the MGC to know, apriori, 
   of any early media session origination from the PSTN. 
    
   The SDP received in 18x provisional response may contain a different 
   session description for early media than that contained in 200 OK 
   for the actual media (this may happen, for example, when the early 
   media is generated by an announcement server different than the 
   called end-point). This separation of session description for early 
   media should be supported. 
    
   Also, SDP is meant for defining session description of the request 
   /response initiating entity. In this context, SDP in the provisional 
   response is treated as an indication that early media will follow. 
   This is a misuse of SDP. This may also cause a problem if other 
   session description mechanism is used instead of SDP. 
    
3 Early Media Scenarios 
    
   We will examine two special cases: (1) is where the INVITE is never 
   forked, and (2) is where the INVITE is forked at least once at a 
   Proxy or Gateway. Under each of these cases, SIP-PSTN interworking 
   scenarios will be examined. Considerations are given for issues with 
   resource reservation and NAT/firewall traversal.

                    Early Media Issues and Scenarios         July, 2001 
 
   In case of PSTN terminating calls, the early media is expected from 
   the PSTN network only after an ACM message is received at the MGC, 
   because, in the PSTN network, a one-way call is established to the 
   caller by the ACM message. Thus the MGC should reserve appropriate 
   resources at the media gateway to allow this media through, even 
   before sending out the IAM message (the ACM message is sent in 
   response to the IAM message). Note that, this assumes that the 
   original INVITE from the caller contains an SDP with receiving RTP 
   port information for early media reception.  
    
   The ACM message from the PSTN is mapped to an 18x message with SDP 
   (port>0) to notify the user of incoming early media from PSTN. The 
   issue here is how the MGC is able to distinguish between the cases 
   when early media will be received and when it would not be, so that 
   it can send the appropriate SDP information in 18x. This may be 
   predicted from the Backward Call Indicator bits in the ACM message, 
   which provides status information of the called end-point (see Table 
   1). Figure 1 provides a partial call set-up flow.

   In this case, the terminating SIP end-point can be the originator of 
   early media. When the MGC receives an IAM from the PSTN, for the 
   same reason as described in the previous section, the Media Gateway 
   and the PSTN network should reserve resources to allow the receipt 
   of early media from the callee. This requires that the ACM message 
   (in response to the IAM message) be sent by the gateway controller 
   to the PSTN network after reserving gateway resources (say, port a) 
   and before sending out the INVITE (with SDP carrying port a) to the 
   callee. This implies that the ACM is sent out without receiving any 
   call status information from the UAS. If the callee wishes to send 
   early media, it SHOULD send a 183 with SDP (port>0) before starting 
   early media transmission. See Figure 2 for a partial call set-up 
   flow.

3.1.3 PBX terminating 
    
   In case of PBX terminating calls, the early media is expected from 
   the PSTN network only if a Progress indicator #1 or #8 is received 
   in any message before the CONNECT message (i.e., CALL PROCEEDING, 
   PROGRESS or ALERTING). Note that this assumes that the original 
   INVITE from the caller contains an SDP with receiving RTP port 
   information for early media reception. If an ALERTING message is 
   received without a Progress indicator #1 or #8 having been receive 
   in any message up-to-and-including the ALERTING message, user 
   alerting (e.g., ringing the phone) has to be applied locally with no 
   early media. 
    
   The message including the Progress indicator #1 or #8 from the PBX 
   is mapped to an 18x message with SDP (port>0) to notify the user of 
   incoming early media from PSTN.

3.1.4 PBX originating 
    
   In this case, the terminating SIP end-point can be the originator of 
   early media. When the MGC receives a SETUP from the PBX, for the 
   same reason as described in the previous section, the Media Gateway 
   and the PBX should reserve resources to allow the receipt of early 
   media from the callee. This requires that a CALL PROCEEDING message 
   (in response to the SETUP message) be sent by the gateway controller 
   to the PBX network after reserving gateway resources (say, port a) 
   and before sending out the INVITE (with SDP carrying port a) to the 
   callee. This implies that the CALL PROCEEDING is sent out without 
   receiving any call status information from the UAS. If the callee 
   wishes to send early media, it SHOULD send a 183 with SDP (port>0) 
   before starting early media transmission. That 183 should be mapped 
   to a PROGRESS message with Progress indicator #8 since there is no 
   way to know if the terminating UAS is busy, ringing, or being 
   provided an announcement.

3.1.5 Other Early Media Issues 
    
   1. Interaction with Resource Reservation 
   [3] proposes extensions to SIP to deal with resource reservation and 
   security set-up negotiation. Proposed SDP extensions allow 
   indication of pre-conditions for sessions, namely, (1) end-to-end 
   resource reservation, and (2) end-to-end security; the sessions are 
   not allowed to proceed until these pre-conditions are met. The 
   successful establishment of a pre-condition (e.g., resource 
   reservation) can be confirmed by either party using a new SIP method 
   called COMET.  
    
   If [3] is used, the QoS reservation and the media resource 
   allocation are completed upon the exchange of the COMET message. For 
   early media reception, the SDP carried in subsequent 18x and 200 OK 
   messages should not be modified after the resource reservation phase 
   is completed (except for port number). In case the SDP information 
   changes in subsequent 18x or 200 response, the resource reservation 
   must re-occur. 
    
   2. Interaction with Firewall/NAT traversal 
   When the SIP client is behind a firewall or NAT/NAPT, the firewall 
   pinhole need to be opened or NAT/NAPT bindings need to be 
   established in one direction to allow early media before the session 
   establishment is completed [1]. In this scenario, there are 
   potential security loopholes if the firewall/NAT has to establish 
   pinholes/bindings without complete knowledge of the media flow 
   (i.e., IP address/port of the callee). This is currently being 
   considered by the MIDCOM WG. 
    
3.2 Forking Proxies 
    
   The fact that proxies, en-route, can fork a SIP INVITE creates 
   additional issues with the potential of the caller receiving 
   multiple early media streams. The issues can be summarized as 
   follows: 
   - Need to arbitrate between multiple early media streams 
   - Need to ensure consistent user behaviour that does not end in the 
   user hanging up the call in between multiple early media sessions 
   - Partial knowledge about the early-media sources during call set-up 
   - Arbitration between multiple provisional 18x responses from early 
   media sources 
   - Potential of race conditions between multiple media streams 
    
   The decoupling of SIP call control from the media allows us less 
   control over the ensuing early media sessions leading to 
   inconsistency in call set-up and undesirable user behaviour. We will 
   discuss these issues in the context of the two kinds of forking 
   scenarios supported by SIP - Parallel and Sequential. Again, we

                    Early Media Issues and Scenarios         July, 2001 
 
   assume that the SIP terminals have the potential to generate early 
   media. 
    
3.2.1 Parallel Forking 
    
   This is definitely the most complex scenario. Multiple proxies can 
   be involved in a call some or all of which can fork an Invite 
   transaction 
    
   In one scenario, the forking end-point destinations can be multiple 
   PSTN gateways. Depending on the call progress at the PSTN networks 
   at the forked legs, the caller can expect one or more simultaneous 
   early media sessions. The issue is with how to treat and, if 
   required, arbitrate between the multiple early media sessions. For 
   example, consider the scenario depicted in Figure 5, where two 
   forked INVITES reach a media gateway (GW1) and a SIP end-point. GW1 
   sends back a busy-tone, which reaches the caller before the called 
   party answers (through the SIP end-point). In this case, the caller 
   may hang-up the call before the callee answers. Thus, such race 
   conditions need to be prevented to avoid undesirable user behaviour 
   during call set-up.

   The INVITE can be forked multiple times by proxies, en-route, 
   compounding the problem of race condition. This is shown in Figure

   Figure 6 
    
   Here early media from three potential sources can reach the caller 
   at any time and, potentially, at the same time too. 
    
   The multiple simultaneous early media sessions, which can result in 
   these scenarios, need to be segregated on the bearer path such that 
   it provides coherent and consistent information to the caller. This 
   can either be done in any media gateway on the media path or at the 
   calling end-point.  
    
   Another problem may occur when multiple provisional 18x responses 
   are received by the UAC from early media end-points. The current 
   version of SIP recommends that the UAC should cease local ring-back 
   when it receives an 18x response with SDP. Also, the normal ring-
   back behaviour is resumed if the UAC receives a provisional response 
   with SDP port=0. According to [4], the 18x responses are treated in 
   the order that they are received. If multiple 18x responses with 
   different SDP are received, the outcome of this behaviour may not be 
   acceptable to the user (e.g., there can be a ring back tone 
   sandwiched between two announcements). 
    
3.2.2 Sequential Forking 
    
   Sequential forking somewhat alleviates the problem caused by 
   multiple parallel early media streams. The forking process may be 
   controlled at the forking proxy imposing certain priority and order 
   on the execution of the early media sessions. Sequential forking can 
   be implemented under policy control, where the forking process is 
   governed by a pre-established priority of the called end-points 
   (assumed to be known at the forking proxy).  
    
   There might be a need for the sequential play-out of all the early 
   media sessions (assuming there are multiple of them). This implies 
   that the forking proxy may need indication of the end of an early 
   media session and use this to trigger the next INVITE to another 
   branch. It may be required that this type of branch migration be 
   controlled by either the caller or the called endpoints. Note that, 
   route-advance is currently triggered [4] either when the party 
   rejects the call with a 4xx or 5xx response, or when the proxy makes 
   a route advance decision based on a timer. 
    
4 Some proposed strategies towards solution 
 
4.1 Background on Previous Proposals  
    
 
                 Informational - Expires January 2002               10
                    Early Media Issues and Scenarios         July, 2001 
 
   The following options to deal with 18x provisional responses were 
   proposed in previous working group meetings and are still under 
   investigation as possible resolutions. 
    
   1. Use INFO to pass ACM-related parameters for interworking with 
   ISUP. 
   2. Eliminate usage of 18x completely (if QoS negotiation is not 
   required, 18x/PRACK can be eliminated). Instead use a one-way 200 OK 
   to establish one-way media path and subsequently use a re-INVITE to 
   complete the two-way session establishment.  
   3. Use of 18x is made optional and negotiable between the clients. 
    
4.2 Early Media with resource reservation  
    
   For PSTN terminating calls, it is required that the IAM message (on 
   receipt of an INVITE from the SIP UAC) be sent out to the PSTN by 
   the gateway controller only after receiving confirmation of resource 
   reservation for delivering the early media to the SIP UAC.  
    
   For PSTN originating calls, an INVITE carrying SDP with the QoS pre-
   condition parameters [3] is sent to the SIP UAC by the MGC on 
   receipt of an IAM message from the PSTN. The (early) media session 
   should not be initiated by the SIP UAC until the resource 
   reservation pre-condition is met. 
    
   As discussed in Section 3.1.5, in both of the above cases, the SDP 
   parameters in subsequent provisional and final responses after COMET 
   should not be modified except for the required indication in SDP 
   port parameter of the early media session. In case the SDP 
   information changes in subsequent 18x or 200 response, the resource 
   reservation must re-occur. 
    
4.3 Strategies to deal with forking 
    
   There are multiple ways to deal with the forking issue. In this 
   section, we discuss some of the possible solution strategies. 
    
   Possible ways of handling multiple early media sessions due to 
   forking are as follows: 
    
   1. Allow no early media 
   2. Allow only one early media session (e.g., the first one) 
   3. Allow multiple early media sessions in a particular order 
    
   For case (1), any SDP information received before the final 200 OK 
   can be blocked at the Proxy. A solution for (2) will, for example, 
   allow the first 18x with SDP and block at the Proxy any other SDP 
   information before the final 200 OK. For case (3), where there is a 
   need to allow multiple early media sessions, the two types of 
   forking scenarios are discussed separately in the following 
   sections.

                    Early Media Issues and Scenarios         July, 2001 
 
4.3.1 Sequential forking 
   The two main issues here are - (1) control of the forking process, 
   and (2) triggering of branch migration at the end of an early media 
   session, in case of multiple sequential early media sessions.  
    
   If the forking proxy is aware of the priorities of the end-points 
   (potential early media sources), it would be possible for it to send 
   them INVITEs at a particular order. This priority may be set by the 
   end-user and can be communicated to the Proxy prior to session 
   establishment. 
    
   When an end-point completes transmission of early media, it may send 
   a message (TBD) to trigger the proxy to route-advance the next 
   INVITE. 
    
4.3.2 Parallel forking 
    
   The main issue here is the potential of the UAC receiving multiple 
   early media streams. The arbitration between the media streams can 
   be done by intelligent handling either at the client terminal or at 
   a gateway on the media path. For example, an intelligent gateway 
   controller can initiate a specific announcement to the client based 
   on interpretation of messages indicating multiple possible early 
   media sessions.  
    
   To avoid caller hanging up the phone on receiving the first 
   announcement and miss several important announcements following it, 
   it may be necessary to notify the UAC via a SIP provisional response 
   (18x) that multiple early media sessions are possible. This is 
   possible by adding an indication (e.g., through a new header) in the 
   18x response at the proxies, if the original INVITE had been forked. 
   Note that, this is applicable to both types of forking scenarios. 
    
5 Conclusion 
    
   There are no clear solutions for the issues with SDP within 18x 
   provisional responses and the forking problems. While workarounds 
   within the current SIP framework are possible for the 18x issues, 
   the forking problem clearly needs improved signalling between the UA 
   and the proxy (e.g. notifying user of multiple possible early media 
   sessions). In the end we would like to offer the end user the choice 
   of dealing with multiple received early media sessions. This 
   requires that the user be reconditioned from their current 
   expectations of the behaviour of the traditional PSTN calls.
