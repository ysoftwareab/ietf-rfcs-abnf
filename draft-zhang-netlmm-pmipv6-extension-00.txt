      Abstract 

        The NetLMM WG is specifying Proxy Mobile IPv6 for network-based 
        localized mobility management (NetLMM), taking basic support for 
        registration, de-registration and handover into account in the first 
        protocol release. When a mobile node connects to the access networks 
        through a sole interface or multiple interfaces, the condition of the 
        access networks should be considered to improve the performance of 
        the ongoing applications. According to the normal operation, Local 
        Mobility Anchor (LMA) can not get enough information to do the 
        necessary scheduling with Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) and Mobile Node 
        (MN), such as flow distribution. This document defines a PMIPv6

        Technology Type option.

      1. Introduction 

        In PMIPv6, MAG is introduced as a main entity responsible for sending 
        messages on behalf of a MN whenever the MN hands over within a Local 
        Mobility Domain (LMD). The messages are sent from a MAG to the LMA 
        and then the LMA creates a binding to tunnel all packets destined for 
        an address of the MN to the current attachment point.  

        The Access Technology Type Option is defined for using it in the 
        Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement messages 
        exchanged between a LMA and a MAG. This option is used for exchanging 
        the type of the access technology using which the mobile node is 
        currently attached to the network through MAG  

        With the advent of various radio access technologies and increasing 
        deployment of sophisticated applications in mobile end systems, LMA 
        needs more information to perform some effective scheduling in order 
        to improve the performance of ongoing applications on both the whole 
        network and MN. However, LMA always can not get the knowledge of the 
        current network condition from MAG or MN according to the normal 
        operation of PMIPv6. The extension of the Access Technology Type 
        Option defined in this document is aimed to let MAG to notify the 
        network condition information to LMA.

      2. Network condition carrying Extension 

        This section defines the network condition carrying extension which 
        may be used in Access Technology Type Option of PMIPv6. The extension 
        is sent by MAG and handled by LMA. The scheme of special use of this 
        extension is out of the scope for this document. 

        The extended Access Technology Type Option has no alignment 
        requirement. Its format is shown in Figure 1.

        Length 

        8-bit unsigned integer indicates the length of the option in octets, 
        excluding the type and length fields. This field MUST be set to 2. 

        Network Condition (NC) 

        A 2-bit field that specifies the network condition corresponding to 
        the MAG which sends this option. The values (0-3) will be allocated 
        and managed by IANA. The following values are currently reserved for 
        the below specified network condition indications. 

                0: Reserved 

                1: Poor network condition 

                2: Medium network condition

        A 8-bit field that specifies the access technology through which the 
        mobile node is connected to the access link on the mobile access 
        gateway. The values (0 - 255) will be allocated and managed by IANA. 
        The following values are currently reserved for the below specified 
        access technology types. 

                 0: Reserved 

                 1: Virtual 

                 2: PPP 

                 3: 802.3 (Ethernet) 

                 4: 802.11a/b/g 

                 5: 802.16e 

        Reserved (R) 

        This 6-bit field is unused for now.  The value MUST be initialized to 
        0 by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver. 

      3. Security Considerations 

        This specification introduces new PMIPv6 extensions that are used to 
        carry network condition information, in the form of classifying 
        description. The PMIPV6 option messages that carry this extension 
        MUST be authenticated as described in [2], unless other 
        authentication methods have been agreed upon. Therefore, this 
        specification does not lessen the security of PMIPv6.  

      4. IANA Considerations 

        This document defines one new PMIPv6 extension to be managed by IANA. 
        Section 3 defines a new PMIPV6 extension, the Network Condition 
        Carrying Extension. The type number for this extension is [TBD, 
        assigned by IANA]. The content and format for this extension is not 
        specific to the technology of the access network, so if in the future 
        new access network are added, they may nevertheless be accommodated 
        within numbering space defined for the network condition Carrying 
        Extension defined in this document.
