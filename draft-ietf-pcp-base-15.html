</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The Port Control Protocol (PCP) provides a mechanism to control how incoming packets are forwarded by upstream devices such as NAT64, NAT44, IPv6 and IPv4 firewall devices, and a mechanism to reduce application keepalive traffic. PCP is designed to be implemented in the context of Carrier-Grade NATs (CGNs), small NATs (e.g., residential NATs), as well as with dual-stack and IPv6-only CPE routers, and all of the currently-known transition scenarios towards IPv6-only CPE routers.  PCP allows hosts to operate servers for a long time (e.g., a webcam) or a short time (e.g., while playing a game or on a phone call) when behind a NAT device, including when behind a CGN operated by their Internet service provider or an IPv6 firewall integrated in their CPE router.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">PCP allows applications to create mappings from an external IP address and port to an internal IP address and port. These mappings are required for successful inbound communications destined to machines located behind a NAT or a firewall.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">After creating a mapping for incoming connections, it is necessary to inform remote computers about the IP address and port for the incoming connection. This is usually done in an application-specific manner. For example, a computer game might use a rendezvous server specific to that game (or specific to that game developer), a SIP phone would use a SIP proxy, and a client using DNS-Based Service Discovery <a href="#I-D.cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd">[I-D.cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd]</a> would use DNS Update <a href="#RFC2136">[RFC2136]</a> <a href="#RFC3007">[RFC3007]</a>. PCP does not provide this rendezvous function. The rendezvous function may support IPv4, IPv6, or both. Depending on that support and the application's support of IPv4 or IPv6, the PCP client may need an IPv4 mapping, an IPv6 mapping, or both.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">Many NAT-friendly applications send frequent application-level messages to ensure their session will not be timed out by a NAT. These are commonly called "NAT keepalive" messages, even though they are not sent to the NAT itself (rather, they are sent 'through' the NAT). These applications can reduce the frequency of such NAT keepalive messages by using PCP to learn (and influence) the NAT mapping lifetime. This helps reduce bandwidth on the subscriber's access network, traffic to the server, and battery consumption on mobile devices.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">Many NATs and firewalls include application layer gateways (ALGs) to create mappings for applications that establish additional streams or accept incoming connections. ALGs incorporated into NATs may also modify the application payload. Industry experience has shown that these ALGs are detrimental to protocol evolution. PCP allows an application to create its own mappings in NATs and firewalls, reducing the incentive to deploy ALGs in NATs and firewalls.</p>

This is important because after a PCP mapping is created and an inbound packet (e.g., TCP SYN) arrives at the host, the outbound response (e.g., TCP SYNACK) has to go through the same path so it is seen by the firewall or rewritten by the NAT. This restriction exists because otherwise there would need to be a PCP-enabled NAT for every egress (because the host could not reliably determine which egress path packets would take) and the client would need to be able to reliably make the same internal/external mapping in every NAT gateway, which in general is not possible (because the other NATs might have the necessary port mapped to another host).</p>

<dl>
<dt>Internal Host:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>A host served by a NAT gateway, or protected by a firewall. This is the host that receives the incoming traffic resulting from a PCP MAP request, or the host that initiated an implicit dynamic mapping (e.g., by sending a TCP SYN) across a firewall or a NAT.</dd>
<dt>Remote Host:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>A host with which an Internal Host is communicating. This can include another Internal Host (or even the same Internal Host); if a NAT is involved, the NAT would need to hairpin the traffic.</dd>
<dt>Internal Address:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>The address of an Internal Host served by a NAT gateway or protected by a firewall.</dd>
<dt>External Address:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>The address of an Internal Host as seen by other Remote Peers on the Internet with which the Internal Host is communicating, after translation by any NAT gateways on the path. An External Address is generally a public routable (i.e., non-private) address. In the case of an Internal Host protected by a pure firewall, with no address translation on the path, its External Address is the same as its Internal Address.</dd>
<dt>Endpoint-Dependent Mapping (EDM):</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A term applied to NAT operation where an implicit mapping created by outgoing traffic (e.g., TCP SYN) from a single Internal Address and Port to different Remote Peers and Ports may be assigned different External Ports, and a subsequent PCP MAP request for that Internal Address and Port may be assigned yet another different External Port.  This term encompasses both Address-Dependent Mapping and Address and Port-Dependent Mapping from <a href="#RFC4787">[RFC4787]</a>.</dd>
<dt>Remote Peer Address:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>The address of a Remote Peer, as seen by the Internal Host. A Remote Address is generally a publicly routable address. In the case of a Remote Peer that is itself served by a NAT gateway, the Remote Address may in fact be the Remote Peer's External Address, but since this remote translation is generally invisible to software running on the Internal Host, the distinction can safely be ignored for the purposes of this document.</dd>
<dt>Third Party:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>In the common case, an Internal Host manages its own Mappings using PCP requests, and the Internal Address of those Mappings is the same as the source IP address of the PCP request packet. <br><br> In the case where one device is managing Mappings on behalf of some other device that does not implement PCP, the presence of the THIRD_PARTY Option in the MAP request signifies that the specified address, rather than the source IP address of the PCP request packet, should be used as the Internal Address for the Mapping.</dd>
<dt>Mapping, Port Mapping, Port Forwarding:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>A NAT mapping creates a relationship between an internal IP address, protocol, and port, and an external IP address, protocol, and port. More specifically, it creates a translation rule where packets destined to the external IP and port are translated to the internal IP and port, and vice versa. In the case of a pure firewall, the "Mapping" is the identity function, translating an internal IP address and port number to the same external IP address and port number. Firewall filtering, applied to that identity function, is separate from the mapping itself.</dd>
<dt>Mapping Types:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>There are three different ways to create mappings: implicit dynamic mappings, explicit dynamic mappings, and static mappings. Implicit dynamic mappings are created as a result of a TCP SYN or outgoing UDP packet or a PCP PEER request, and allow Internal Hosts to receive replies to their outbound packets. Explicit dynamic mappings are created as a result of a PCP MAP request. Static mappings are created by manual configuration (e.g., via command-line interface or web page). Explicit and static mappings allow Internal Hosts to receive inbound traffic that is not in direct response to any immediately preceding outbound communication (i.e., to allow Internal Hosts to operate a "server" that is accessible to other hosts on the Internet). Both implicit and explicit dynamic mappings are dynamic in the sense that they are created on demand, as requested (implicitly or explicitly) by the Internal Host, and have a lifetime. After the lifetime, the mapping is deleted unless the lifetime is extended by action by the Internal Host (e.g., sending more traffic or sending a new PCP MAP request).  Static mappings differ from dynamic mappings in that their lifetime is effectively infinite (they exist until manually removed) but otherwise they behave exactly the same as an explicit dynamic mapping.</dd>
<dt>PCP Client:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>A PCP software instance responsible for issuing PCP requests to a PCP server.  Several independent PCP Clients can exist on the same host (just as several independent web browsers can exist on the same host).  Several PCP Clients can be located in the same local network. A PCP Client can issue PCP requests on behalf of a third party device for which it is authorized to do so. An interworking function from Universal Plug and Play Internet Gateway Device (UPnP IGD, <a href="#IGD">[IGD]</a>) to PCP is another example of a PCP Client. A PCP server in a NAT gateway that is itself a client of another NAT gateway (nested NAT) may itself act as a PCP client to the upstream NAT.</dd>
<dt>PCP-Controlled Device:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>A NAT or firewall that controls or rewrites packet flows between internal hosts and remote hosts.  PCP manages the Mappings on this device.</dd>
<dt>PCP Server:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>A PCP software instance that implements the server side of the PCP protocol, via which PCP clients request and manage explicit mappings. This is conceptually separate from the NAT or firewall itself, but is typically implemented as a capability of the PCP-controlled device.  See also <a href="#relationship">Section 4</a>.</dd>
<dt>Interworking Function:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br>A functional element responsible for translating or proxying another protocol to PCP. For example interworking between <a href="#IGD">UPnP IGD</a> <cite title="NONE">[IGD]</cite> with PCP.</dd>
<dt>Subscriber:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br> The unit of billing for a commercial ISP. A subscriber may have a single IP address from the commercial ISP (which can be shared among multiple hosts using a NAT gateway, thereby making them appear to be a single host to the ISP) or may have multiple IP addresses provided by the commercial ISP. In either case, the IP address or addresses provided by the ISP may themselves be further translated by a large-scale NAT operated by the ISP.</dd>

<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">The PCP server receives and responds to PCP requests. The PCP server functionality is typically a capability of a NAT or firewall device, as shown in <a href="#diagram_pcp_server">Figure 1</a>. It is also possible for the PCP functionality to be provided by some other device, which communicates with the actual NAT or firewall via some other proprietary mechanism, as long as from the PCP client's perspective such split operation is indistinguishable from the integrated case.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">A NAT or firewall device, between the PCP client and the Internet, might implement simple or advanced firewall functionality.  This may be a side-effect of the technology implemented by the device (e.g., a network address and port translator, by virtue of its port rewriting, normally requires connections to be initiated from an inside host towards the Internet), or this might be an explicit firewall policy to deny unsolicited traffic from the Internet.  Some firewall devices deny certain unsolicited traffic from the Internet (e.g., TCP, UDP to most ports) but allow certain other unsolicited traffic from the Internet (e.g., UDP port 500 and IPsec ESP as described in <a href="#RFC6092">[RFC6092]</a>).  Such default filtering (or lack thereof) is out of scope of PCP itself.  If a device supports PCP and wants to receive traffic, and does not possess knowledge of such filtering, it SHOULD use PCP to create the necessary mappings to receive the desired traffic.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.1">A PCP Opcode can be extended with one or more Options. Options can be used in requests and responses. The design decisions in this specification about whether to include a given piece of information in the base Opcode format or in an Option were an engineering trade-off between packet size and code complexity. For information that is usually (or always) required, placing it in the fixed Opcode data results in simpler code to generate and parse the packet, because the information is a fixed location in the Opcode data, but wastes space in the packet in the event that field is all-zeroes because the information is not needed or not relevant. For information that is required less often, placing it in an Option results in slightly more complicated code to generate and parse packets containing that Option, but saves space in the packet when that information is not needed. Placing information in an Option also means that an implementation that never uses that information doesn't even need to implement code to generate and parse it. For example, a client that never requests mappings on behalf of some other device doesn't need to implement code to generate the THIRD_PARTY Option, and a PCP server that doesn't implement the necessary security measures to create third-party mappings safely doesn't need to implement code to parse the THIRD_PARTY Option.</p>

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.2">The description of the fields is as follows:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Option Code:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">8 bits.  Its most significant bit and indicates if this Option is mandatory (0) or optional (1) to process.</dd>
<dt>Reserved:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">8 bits. MUST be set to 0 on transmission and MUST be ignored on reception.</dd>
<dt>Option Length:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">16 bits. Indicates the length of the enclosed data, in octets. Options with length of 0 are allowed.  Options that are not a multiple of four octets long are followed by one, two, or three octets of zeros to pad their effective length in the packet to be a multiple of four octets. The Option Length reflects the semantic length of the option, not including the padding octets.</dd>
<dt>data:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Option data. The Option data MUST end on a 32-bit boundary, padded with 0's when necessary.</dd>
</dl>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.3">The handling of an Option by the PCP client and PCP server MUST be specified in an appropriate document, which MUST include whether the PCP Option can appear in a request and/or response, whether it can appear more than once, and indicate what sort of Option data it conveys. If several Options are included in a PCP request, they MAY be encoded in any order by the PCP client, but MUST be processed by the PCP server in the order in which they appear.  It is the responsibility of the PCP client to ensure the server has sufficient room to reply with an error including UNPROCESSED Options; this can be achieved by sending messages that don't exceed 1024-4*number_of_options octets.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.4">If, while processing an Option, an error is encountered that causes a PCP error response to be generated, the PCP request MUST cause no state change in the PCP server or the PCP-controlled device (i.e., it rolls back any changes it might have made while processing the request). The response MUST encode the Options in the same order as received in the request.  Additional Options included in the response (if any) MUST be included at the end. An Option MAY appear more than once in a request or in a response, if permitted by the definition of the Option. If the Option's definition allows the Option to appear only once but it appears more than once in a request, and the Option is understood by the PCP server, the PCP server MUST respond with the MALFORMED_OPTION result code; if this occurs in a response, the PCP client processes the first occurrence and MAY log an error.  If an invalid option length is encountered (e.g., option length extends beyond the length of the PCP Opcode itself), the error MALFORMED_OPTION SHOULD be returned (rather than MALFORMED_REQUEST), as that helps the client better understand how the packet was malformed.  The UNPROCESSED option MUST NOT appear in a request; if it does, it causes a MALFORMED_REQUEST error.  If a PCP response would have exceeded the maximum PCP message size, the PCP server MAY respond with MALFORMED_REQUEST.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.5">The most significant bit in the Option Code indicates if its processing is optional or mandatory.  If the most significant bit is set, handling this Option is optional, and a PCP server MAY process or ignore this Option, entirely at its discretion.  If the most significant bit is clear, handling this Option is mandatory, and a PCP server MUST process this Option or return an error code if it cannot.  If the PCP server does not implement this Option, or cannot perform the function indicated by this Option (e.g., due to a parsing error with the Option), it MUST generate an error response with code UNSUPP_OPTION or MALFORMED_OPTION (as appropriate) and MUST include the UNPROCESSED Option in the response (see <a href="#unprocessed">Section 7.7.1</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.6">PCP clients are free to ignore any or all Options included in responses, although naturally if a client explicitly requests an Option where correct handling of that Option requires processing the Option data in the response, that client is expected to implement code to do that.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.7">Different options are valid for different Opcodes. For example, the UNPROCESSED option is valid for all Opcodes, but only in response messages.  The THIRD_PARTY Option is valid for both MAP and PEER Opcodes.  The PREFER_FAILURE option is valid only for the MAP Opcode (for the PEER Opcode, its semantics are implied).  The FILTER option is valid only for the MAP Opcode (for the PEER Opcode it would have no meaning).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.8">Option definitions MUST include the information below:</p>
<p></p>

<ul class="empty">
<li>Option Name: &lt;mnemonic&gt;</li>
<li>Number: &lt;value&gt;</li>
<li>Purpose: &lt;textual description&gt;</li>

<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.1">The following result codes may be returned as a result of any Opcode received by the PCP server. The only success result code is 0; other values indicate an error. If a PCP server encounters multiple errors during processing of a request, it SHOULD use the most specific error message. Each error code below is classified as either a 'long lifetime' error or a 'short lifetime' error, which provides guidance to PCP server developers for the value of the Lifetime field for these errors. It is RECOMMENDED that short lifetime errors use a 30 second lifetime and long lifetime errors use a 30 minute lifetime.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">PCP is idempotent, meaning that if the PCP client sends the same request multiple times (or the PCP client sends the request once and it is duplicated by the network), and the PCP server processes those requests multiple times, the result is the same as if the PCP server had processed only one of those duplicate requests.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.7.1">7.1.</a> <a href="#general_generate_request" id="general_generate_request">General PCP Client: Generating a Request</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.1">This section details operation specific to a PCP client, for any Opcode. Procedures specific to the MAP Opcode are described in <a href="#map_opcodes">Section 9</a>, and procedures specific to the PEER Opcode are described in <a href="#peer_opcodes">Section 10</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.2">Prior to sending its first PCP message, the PCP client determines which server to use. The PCP client performs the following steps to determine its PCP server: </p>

<ol>
<li>if a PCP server is configured (e.g., in a configuration file or via DHCP), that single configuration source is used as the list of PCP Server(s), else;</li>
<li>the default router list (for IPv4 and IPv6) is used as the list of PCP Server(s).</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.3">For the purposes of this document, only a single PCP server address is supported. Should future specifications define configuration methods that provide a list of PCP server addresses, those specifications will define how clients select one or more addresses from that list.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.4">With that PCP server address, the PCP client formulates its PCP request. The PCP request contains a PCP common header, PCP Opcode and payload, and (possibly) Options. As with all UDP or TCP client software on any operating system, when several independent PCP clients exist on the same host, each uses a distinct source port number to disambiguate their requests and replies. The PCP client's source port SHOULD be randomly generated <a href="#RFC6056">[RFC6056]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.5">To assist with detecting an on-path NAT, the PCP client MUST include the source IP address of the PCP message in the PCP request.  This is typically its own IP address; see <a href="#implement_source_address">Section 12.4</a> for how this can be coded.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.6">When attempting to contact a PCP server, the PCP client initializes a timer to 2 seconds. The PCP client sends a PCP message to the first server in its list of PCP servers. If no response is received before the timer expires, the timer is doubled (to 4 seconds) and the request is re-transmitted. If no response is received before the timer expires, the timer is doubled again (to 8 seconds) and the request is re-transmitted.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.7">Once a PCP client has successfully received a response from a PCP server on that interface, it sends subsequent PCP requests to that same server, with a retransmission timer of 2 seconds. If, after 2 seconds, a response is not received from that PCP server, the same back-off algorithm described above is performed.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.2">7.2.</a> General PCP Server: Processing a Request</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.1">This section details operation specific to a PCP server. Processing SHOULD be performed in the order of the following paragraphs.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.2">A PCP server MUST only accept normal (non-THIRD_PARTY) PCP requests from a client on the same interface it would normally receive packets from that client, and MUST silently ignore PCP requests arriving on any other interface. For example, a residential NAT gateway accepts PCP requests only when they arrive on its (LAN) interface connecting to the internal network, and silently ignores any PCP requests arriving on its external (WAN) interface. A PCP server which supports THIRD_PARTY requests MAY be configured to accept THIRD_PARTY requests on other interfaces from properly authorized clients.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.3">Upon receiving a request, the PCP server parses and validates it.  A valid request contains a valid PCP common header, one valid PCP Opcode, and zero or more Options (which the server might or might not comprehend). If an error is encountered during processing, the server generates an error response which is sent back to the PCP client.  Processing an Opcode and the Options are specific to each Opcode.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.4">If the received message is at least two octets long but the first octet (version) is a version that is not supported, a response is generated with the UNSUPP_VERSION result code, and the other steps detailed in <a href="#version">Section 7.6</a> are followed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.5">Otherwise, if the version is supported but the received message is shorter than 4 octets or has the R bit set, the message is silently dropped.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.6">If the server is overloaded by requests (from a particular client or from all clients), it MAY simply discard requests, as the requests will be retried by PCP clients, or it MAY generate the NO_RESOURCES error response.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.7">If the length of the message exceeds 1024 octets or is not a multiple of 4 octets, it is invalid. Invalid requests are handled by copying up to 1024 octets of the request into the response, setting the result code to MALFORMED_REQUEST, and zero-padding the response to a multiple of 4 octets if necessary.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.8">The PCP server compares the IP address (from the IP header) with the field PCP Client IP Adddress.  If they do not match, the error ADDRESS_MISMATCH MUST be returned.  This is done to detect and prevent accidental use of PCP where a non-PCP-aware NAT exists between the PCP client and PCP server.  If the PCP client wants such a mapping it needs to ensure the PCP field matches the IP address from the perspective of the PCP server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.9">Error responses have the same packet layout as success responses, with fields from the request copied into the response, and fields assigned by the PCP server set as indicated in <a href="#common_response">Figure 3</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.10">Copying request fields are important because this is what enables a client to identify to which request a given error response pertains.  For OpCodes that are understood by the PCP server, it follows the requirements of that OpCode to copy the appropriate fields.  For OpCodes that are not understood by the PCP server, it simply generates the UNSUPP_OPCODE response and copies fields from the PCP header and copies the rest of the PCP payload as-is (without attempting to interpret it).</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.3">7.3.</a> General PCP Client: Processing a Response</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.1">The PCP client receives the response and verifies that the source IP address and port belong to the PCP server of an outstanding PCP request. It validates that the Opcode matches an outstanding PCP request. Responses shorter than 24 octets, longer than 1024 octets, or not a multiple of 4 octets are invalid and ignored, likely causing the request to be re-transmitted. The response is further matched by comparing fields in the response Opcode-specific data to fields in the request Opcode-specific data, as described by the processing for that Opcode. After these matches are successful, the PCP client checks the Epoch field to determine if it needs to restore its state to the PCP server (see <a href="#epoch">Section 7.5</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.2">If the PCP Client's IP Address and PCP Client's Port fields of the PCP response header do not match the source address and port of the request, it indicates the presence of a NAT between the PCP client and PCP server.  If they don't match, then the PCP client (or the user on the client host) MUST ensure that an appropriate NAT mapping is created on the intervening NAT(s) (e.g., using UPnP IGD, NAT-PMP, or manual configuration), otherwise, the PCP-installed mapping will be ineffective.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.1">Hosts which desire a PCP mapping might be multi-interfaced (i.e., own several logical/physical interfaces). Indeed, a host can be configured with several IPv4 addresses (e.g., WiFi and Ethernet) or dual-stacked. These IP addresses may have distinct reachability scopes (e.g., if IPv6 they might have global reachability scope as for Global Unicast Address (GUA, <a href="#RFC3587">[RFC3587]</a>) or limited scope as for <a href="#RFC4193">Unique Local Address (ULA)</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4193]</cite>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.2">IPv6 addresses with global reachability (e.g., GUA) SHOULD be used as the source address when generating a PCP request. IPv6 addresses without global reachability (e.g., <a href="#RFC4193">ULA</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4193]</cite>), SHOULD NOT be used as the source interface when generating a PCP request. If <a href="#RFC4941">IPv6 privacy addresses</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4941]</cite> are used for PCP mappings, a new PCP request will need to be issued whenever the IPv6 privacy address is changed. This PCP request SHOULD be sent from the IPv6 privacy address itself. It is RECOMMENDED that mappings to the previous privacy address be deleted.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.3">Due to the ubiquity of IPv4 NAT, IPv4 addresses with limited scope (e.g., <a href="#RFC1918">private addresses</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC1918]</cite>) MAY be used as the source interface when generating a PCP request.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.4">As mentioned in <a href="#single_homed">Section 2.3</a>, only single-homed CP routers are in scope. Therefore, there is no viable scenario where a host located behind a CP router is assigned two Global Unicast Addresses belonging to different global IPv6 prefixes.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.5.p.1">Every PCP response sent by the PCP server includes an Epoch field.  This field increments by 1 every second, and is used by the PCP client to determine if PCP state needs to be restored. If the PCP server resets or loses the state of its explicit dynamic Mappings (that is, those mappings created by PCP MAP requests), due to reboot, power failure, or any other reason, it MUST reset its Epoch time to zero or adjust its Epoch time (up or down) by at least 87840 seconds (24 hours).  After resetting its Epoch time, it resumes incrementing the Epoch value by one every second.  Similarly, if the public IP address(es) of the NAT (controlled by the PCP server) changes, the Epoch MUST be reset.  A PCP server MAY maintain one Epoch value for all PCP clients, or MAY maintain distinct Epoch values (per PCP client, per interface, or based on other criteria); this choice is implementation-dependent.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.5.p.2">Whenever a client receives a PCP response, the client computes an expected Epoch value based on the Epoch value in the last packet it received from that PCP server plus the time elapsed since that packet was received.  If the received Epoch value is less then 7/8 (0.875%) seconds below the expected Epoch value, or is more than 3660 seconds (one hour) above or below the expected Epoch value, the PCP client concludes that the PCP server lost state.

<li>The client sends first request using highest (i.e., presumably 'best') version number it supports.</li>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.1">There are four uses for the MAP and PEER Opcodes defined in this document:</p>

<ul>
<li>a host operating a server and wanting an incoming connection (<a href="#operating_a_server">Section 8.1</a>);</li>
<li>a host operating a client and server on the same port (<a href="#pcp_symmetric">Section 8.2</a>);</li>
<li>a host operating a client and wanting to optimize the application keepalive traffic (<a href="#keepalives">Section 8.3</a>);</li>
<li>and a host operating a client and wanting to restore lost state in its NAT (<a href="#restoring">Section 8.4</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.2">These are discussed in the following sections.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.3">When operating a server (<a href="#operating_a_server">Section 8.1</a> and <a href="#pcp_symmetric">Section 8.2</a>) the PCP client knows if it wants an IPv4 listener, IPv6 listener, or both on the Internet. The PCP client also knows if it has an IPv4 address or IPv6 address configured on one of its interfaces.  It takes the union of this knowledge to decide to which of its PCP servers to send the request (e.g., a PCP server on its IPv4 interface or its IPv6 interface), and if to send one or two MAP requests for each of its interfaces (e.g., if the PCP client has only an IPv4 address but wants both IPv6 and IPv4 listeners, it sends a MAP request containing the all-zeros IPv6 address in the Requested External Address field, and sends a second MAP request containing the all-zeros IPv4 address in the Requested External Address field.  If the PCP client has both an IPv4 and IPv6 address, and only wants an IPv4 listener, it sends one MAP request from its IPv4 interface (if the PCP server supports NAT44 or IPv4 firewall) or one MAP request from its IPv6 interface (if the PCP server supports NAT64)). The PCP client can simply request the desired mapping to determine if the PCP server supports the desired mapping. Applications that embed IP addresses in payloads (e.g., FTP, SIP) will find it beneficial to avoid address family translation, if possible.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.4">It is REQUIRED that the PCP-controlled device assign the same external IP address to PCP-created explicit dynamic mappings and to implicit dynamic mappings for a given Internal Host. In the absence of a PCP option indicating otherwise, it is REQUIRED that PCP-created explicit dynamic mappings be assigned the same external IP address.  It is RECOMMENDED that static mappings for that Internal Host (e.g., those created by a command-line interface on the PCP server or PCP-controlled device) also be assigned to the same IP address. Once all internal addresses assigned to a given Internal Host have no implicit dynamic mappings and have no explicit dynamic mappings in the PCP-controlled device, a subsequent PCP request for that Internal Address MAY be assigned to a different External Address. Generally, this re-assignment would occur when a CGN device is load balancing newly-seen hosts to its public IPv4 address pool.</p>

<ul class="empty"><li>Discussion: In general, a PCP client doesn't know in advance if it is behind a NAT or firewall. On detecting the host has connected to a new network, the PCP client can attempt to request a mapping using PCP, and if that succeeds then the client knows it has successfully created a mapping. If after multiple retries it has received no PCP response, then either the client is *not* behind a NAT or firewall and has unfettered connectivity, or the client *is* behind a NAT or firewall which doesn't support PCP (and the client may still have working connectivity by virtue of static mappings previously created manually by the user).  Retransmitting PCP requests multiple times before giving up and assuming unfettered connectivity adds delay in that case.  Initiating outbound TCP connections immediately without waiting for PCP avoids this delay, and will work if the NAT has endpoint-independent mapping (EIM) behavior, but may fail if the NAT has endpoint-dependent mapping (EDM) behavior.  Waiting enough time to allow an explicit PCP MAP Mapping to be created (if possible) first ensures that the same External Port will then be used for all subsequent TCP SYNs sent from the specified Internal Address and Port. PCP supports both EIM and EDM NATs, so clients need to assume they may be dealing with an EDM NAT. In this case, the client will experience more reliable connectivity if it attempts explicit PCP MAP requests first, before initiating any outbound TCP connections from that Internal Address and Port.

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.4.p.1">After a NAT loses state (e.g., because of a crash or power failure), it is useful for clients to re-establish TCP mappings on the NAT. This allows servers on the Internet to see traffic from the same IP address and port, so that sessions can be resumed exactly where they were left off. This can be useful for long-lived connections (e.g., instant messaging) or for connections transferring a lot of data (e.g., FTP). This can be accomplished by first establishing a TCP connection normally and then sending a PEER request/response and remembering the External Address and External Port. Later, when the NAT has lost state, the client can send a PEER request with the Suggested External Port and Suggested External Address remembered from the previous session, which will create a mapping in the NAT that functions exactly as an implicit dynamic mapping. The client then resumes sending TCP data to the server. </p>

<ul class="empty"><li>Note: This procedure works well for TCP, provided the NAT only creates a new implicit dynamic mapping for TCP segments with the SYN bit set (i.e., the newly-booted NAT drops the re-transmitted data segments from the client because the NAT does not have an active mapping for those segments), and if the server is not sending data that elicits a RST from the NAT. This is not the case for UDP, because a new UDP mapping will be created (probably on a different port) as soon as UDP traffic is seen by the NAT.</li></ul>

<p id="rfc.section.9.p.3">Mappings created by PCP MAP requests are, by definition, Endpoint Independent Mappings (EIM) with Endpoint Independent Filtering (EIF) (unless the FILTER Option is used), even on a NAT that usually creates Endpoint Dependent Mappings (EDM) or Endpoint Dependent Filtering (EDF) for outgoing connections, since the purpose of an (unfiltered) MAP mapping is to receive inbound traffic from any remote endpoint, not from only one specific remote endpoint.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.4">Note also that all NAT mappings (created by PCP or otherwise) are by necessity bidirectional and symmetric. For any packet going in one direction (in or out) that is translated by the NAT, a reply going in the opposite direction needs to have the corresponding opposite translation done so that the reply arrives at the right endpoint. This means that if a client creates a MAP mapping, and then later sends an outgoing packet using the mapping's internal source port, the NAT should translate that packet's Internal Address and Port to the mapping's External Address and Port, so that replies addressed to the External Address and Port are correctly translated to the mapping's Internal Address and Port.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.5">On Operating Systems that allow multiple listening clients to bind to the same Internal Port, clients MUST ensure that they have exclusive use of that Internal Port (e.g., by binding the port using INADDR_ANY, or using SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE or similar) before sending their MAP request, to ensure that no other clients on the same machine are also listening on the same Internal Port.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.2">The request MAY contain values in the Suggested External Port and Suggested External IP Address fields. This allows the PCP client to attempt to rebuild lost state on the PCP server, which improves the chances of existing connections surviving, and helps the PCP client avoid having to change information maintained at its rendezvous server. Of course, due to other activity on the network (e.g., by other users or network renumbering), the PCP server may not be able grant the suggested External IP Address and Port, and in that case it will assign a different External IP Address and Port.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.9.2.1.p.1">An existing mapping can have its lifetime extended by the PCP client. To do this, the PCP client sends a new MAP request indicating the internal port. The PCP MAP request SHOULD also include the currently assigned external IP address and port as the suggested external IP address and port, so that if the NAT gateway has lost state it can recreate the lost mapping with the same parameters.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.1.p.2">The PCP client SHOULD renew the mapping before its expiry time, otherwise it will be removed by the PCP server (see <a href="#lifetime">Section 9.5</a>).  To reduce the risk of inadvertent synchronization of renewal requests, a random jitter component should be included. It is RECOMMENDED that PCP clients send a single renewal request packet at a time chosen with uniform random distribution in the range 1/2 to 5/8 of expiration time.  If no SUCCESS response is received, then the next renewal request should be sent 3/4 to 3/4 + 1/16 to expiration, and then another 7/8 to 7/8 + 1/32 to expiration, and so on, subject to the constraint that renewal requests MUST NOT be sent less than four seconds apart (a PCP client MUST NOT send a flood of ever-closer-together requests in the last few seconds before a mapping expires).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.1.p.3">The PCP client SHOULD impose an upper limit on this returned Assigned Lifetime value, and 24 hours is RECOMMENDED.  This means if the PCP server returns an absurdly long Assigned Lifetime (e.g., 5 years), the PCP client will behave as if it received a more sane value (e.g., 24 hours).</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.1">This section and <a href="#lifetime">Section 9.5</a> describe the operation of a PCP server when processing a request with the MAP Opcode. Processing SHOULD be performed in the order of the following paragraphs.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.2">The following fields from the MAP request are copied into the MAP response: Protocol, Internal Port, Requested External Address, and (if present and processed by the PCP server) the THIRD_PARTY Option.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.3">If the requested lifetime is non-zero, it indicates a request to create a mapping or extend the lifetime of an existing mapping.  If the PCP server or PCP-controlled device does not support the Protocol or cannot create a mapping for the Protocol (e.g., because the request is for a NAT mapping instead of a firewall mapping and the PCP-controlled device is not a NAT or does not support NATting that specific Protocol), it MUST generate an UNSUPP_PROTOCOL error.  If the Protocol is supported and the Internal Port is zero but the protocol uses a 16 bit port number (e.g., TCP, SCTP), it generates a MALFORMED_REQUEST error.  If the Protocol is supported and does not use 16 bit port number (e.g., RSVP), the Internal Port and the Requested External Port are ignored, all packets with that Protocol number are mapped to the internal host, and these ignored field values are copied into the response.  If the Protocol and Internal Port are both 0 (zero), all protocols and all ports, without any exception, are mapped; if this request cannot be fulfilled, the error UNSUPP_PROTOCOL MUST be returned.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.4">If the requested lifetime is zero, it indicates a request to delete an existing mapping or set of mappings.  Processing of the lifetime is described in <a href="#lifetime">Section 9.5</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.5">If the PCP-controlled device is stateless (that is, it does not establish any per-flow state, and simply rewrites the address and/or port in a purely algorithmic fashion), the PCP server simply returns an answer indicating the external IP address and port yielded by this stateless algorithmic translation. This allows the PCP client to learn its external IP address and port as seen by remote peers. Examples of stateless translators include stateless NAT64, 1:1 NAT44, and <a href="#RFC6296">NPTv6</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC6296]</cite>, all of which modify addresses but not port numbers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.6">If an Option with value less than 128 exists (i.e., mandatory to process) but that Option does not make sense (e.g., the PREFER_FAILURE Option is included in a request with lifetime=0), the request is invalid and generates a MALFORMED_OPTION error.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.7">If a mapping already exists for the requested Internal Address and Port and the PREFER_FAILURE Option is not present, the PCP server MUST refresh the lifetime of that already-existing mapping, and return the already-existing External Address and Port in its response, regardless of the Suggested External Address and Port in the request.  If a mapping already exists for the requested Internal Address and Port the request contains the PREFER_FAILURE Option, but the Suggested External Address and Port do not match the actual External Address and Port of the already existing mapping, the error CANNOT_PROVIDE_EXTERNAL_PORT is returned.  If an implicit mapping already exists for the requested Internal Address and Port, the mapping SHOULD be upgraded to an explicit mapping.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.8">If no mapping exists for the Internal Address and Port, and the PCP server is able to create a mapping using the Suggested External Address and Port, it SHOULD do so. This is beneficial for re-establishing state lost in the PCP server (e.g., due to a reboot). If the PCP server cannot assign the Suggested External Address and Port but can assign some other External Address and Port (and the request did not contain the PREFER_FAILURE Option) the PCP server MUST do so and return the newly assigned External Address and Port in the response. Cases where a NAT gateway cannot assign the Suggested External Address and Port include: </p>

<ul>
<li>The Suggested External Address and Port is already assigned to another existing explicit, implicit, or static mapping (i.e., is already forwarding traffic to some other internal address and port).</li>
<li>The Suggested External Address and Port is already used by the NAT gateway for one of its own services (e.g., port 80 for the NAT gateway's own configuration pages).</li>
<li>The Suggested External Address and Port is otherwise prohibited by the PCP server's policy.</li>
<li>The Suggested External Address or port is invalid (e.g., 127.0.0.1, ::1, multicast address, or the port 0 is not valid for the indicated protocol).</li>
<li>The Suggested External Address does not belong to the NAT gateway.</li>
<li>The Suggested External Address is not configured to be used as an external address of the firewall or NAT gateway.</li>
<li>The PREFER_FAILURE option is included in the request and the Suggested External Address and Port are not assignable to the PCP client, which returns the CANNOT_PROVIDE_EXTERNAL_PORT error.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.9">By default, a PCP-controlled device MUST NOT create mappings for a protocol not indicated in the request. For example, if the request was for a TCP mapping, a UDP mapping MUST NOT be created.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.10">Mappings typically consume state on the PCP-controlled device, and it is RECOMMENDED that a per-host and/or per-subscriber limit be enforced by the PCP server to prevent exhausting the mapping state. If this limit is exceeded, the result code USER_EX_QUOTA is returned.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.11">If all of the preceding operations were successful (did not generate an error response), then the requested mapping is created or refreshed as described in the request and a SUCCESS response is built.  This SUCCESS response contains the same Opcode as the request, but with the "R" bit set.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.4">9.4.</a> Processing a MAP Response</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.1">This section describes the operation of the PCP client when it receives a PCP response for the MAP Opcode.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.2">After performing common PCP response processing, the response is further matched with an outstanding request by comparing the protocol, internal IP address, and internal port. Other fields are not compared, because the PCP server sets those fields.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.3">On a success response, the PCP client can use the External IP Address and Port as desired. Typically the PCP client will communicate the External IP Address and Port to another host on the Internet using an application-specific rendezvous mechanism such as DNS SRV records.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.4">The PCP client MUST also set a timer or otherwise schedule an event to renew the mapping before its lifetime expires. Renewing a mapping is performed by sending another MAP request, exactly as described in <a href="#map-opcode_client_operation">Section 9.2</a>, except that the Suggested External Address and Port SHOULD be set to the values received in the response. From the PCP server's point of view a MAP request to renew a mapping is identical to a MAP request to request a new mapping, and is handled identically.  Indeed, in the event of PCP server state loss, a renewal request from a PCP client will appear to the server to be a request for a new mapping, with a particular Suggested External Address and Port, which happens to be what the PCP server previously assigned. See also <a href="#maintaining_mappings">Section 12.3.2</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.5">On an error response, the client SHOULD NOT repeat the same request to the same PCP server within the lifetime returned in the response.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.5">9.5.</a> <a href="#lifetime" id="lifetime">Mapping Lifetime and Deletion</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.1">The PCP client requests a certain lifetime, and the PCP server responds with the assigned lifetime. The PCP server MAY grant a lifetime smaller or larger than the requested lifetime. The PCP server SHOULD be configurable for permitted minimum and maximum lifetime, and the RECOMMENDED values are 120 seconds for the minimum value and 24 hours for the maximum. It is RECOMMENDED that the server be configurable to restrict lifetimes to less than 24 hours, because mappings will consume ports even if the Internal Host is no longer interested in receiving the traffic or is no longer connected to the network. These recommendations are not strict, and deployments should evaluate the trade offs to determine their own minimum and maximum lifetime values.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.2">Once a PCP server has responded positively to a mapping request for a certain lifetime, the port mapping is active for the duration of the lifetime unless the lifetime is reduced by the PCP client (to a shorter lifetime or to zero) or until the PCP server loses its state (e.g., crashes). Mappings created by PCP MAP requests are not special or different from mappings created in other ways. In particular, it is implementation-dependent if outgoing traffic extends the lifetime of such mappings beyond the PCP-assigned lifetime. PCP clients MUST NOT depend on this behavior to keep mappings active, and MUST explicitly renew their mappings as required by the Lifetime field in PCP response messages.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.3">If a PCP client sends a PCP MAP request to create a mapping that already exists as a static mapping, the PCP server will return a successful result, confirming that the requested mapping exists. The lifetime the PCP server returns for such a static mapping SHOULD be 4294967295 (0xFFFFFFFF).  There is no need for a PCP client to renew a static mapping.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.4">If the requested lifetime is zero then: </p>

<ul>
<li>If both the internal port and protocol are non-zero, it indicates a request to delete the indicated mapping immediately.</li>
<li>If both the internal port and protocol are zero, it indicates a request to delete all mappings for this Internal Address for all transport protocols. This is useful when a host reboots or joins a new network, to clear out prior stale state from the NAT gateway before beginning to install new mappings.</li>
<li>If the internal port is zero and the protocol is non-zero, or the internal port is non-zero and the protocol is zero, then the request is invalid and the PCP Server MUST return a MALFORMED_REQUEST error to the client.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.5">In requests where the requested Lifetime is 0, the Suggested External Address and Suggested External Port fields MUST be set to zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on reception, and these fields MUST be copied into the Assigned External IP Address and Assigned External Port of the response.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.6">If the PCP client attempts to delete a single static mapping (i.e., a mapping created outside of PCP itself), the error NOT_AUTHORIZED is returned. If the PCP client attempts to delete a mapping that does not exist, the SUCCESS result code is returned (this is necessary for PCP to be idempotent). If the PCP MAP request was for port=0 (indicating 'all ports'), the PCP server deletes all of the explicit dynamic mappings it can (but not any implicit or static mappings), and returns a SUCCESS response. If the deletion request was properly formatted and successfully processed, a SUCCESS response is generated with lifetime of 0 and the server copies the protocol and internal port number from the request into the response. An explicit dynamic mapping MUST NOT have its lifetime reduced by transport protocol messages (e.g., TCP RST, TCP FIN).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.7">An application that forgets its PCP-assigned mappings (e.g., the application or OS crashes) will request new PCP mappings. This may consume port mappings, if the application binds to a different Internal Port every time it runs. The application will also likely initiate new implicit dynamic mappings without using PCP, which will also consume port mappings. If there is a port mapping quota for the Internal Host, frequent restarts such as this may exhaust the quota.  PCP provides some protections against such port consumption: When a PCP client first acquires a new IP address (e.g., reboots or joins a new network), it SHOULD remove mappings that may already be instantiated for that new Internal Address. To do this, the PCP client sends a MAP request with protocol, internal port, and lifetime set to 0. Some port mapping APIs (e.g., the "DNSServiceNATPortMappingCreate" API provided by Apple's Bonjour on Mac OS X, iOS, Windows, Linux <a href="#Bonjour">[Bonjour]</a>) automatically monitor for process exit (including application crashes) and automatically send port mapping deletion requests if the process that requested them goes away without explicitly relinquishing them.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.8">To reduce unwanted traffic and data corruption, External UDP and TCP ports SHOULD NOT be re-used for an interval (TIME_WAIT interval <a href="#RFC0793">[RFC0793]</a>). However, the PCP server SHOULD allow the previous user of an External Port to re-acquire the same port during that interval.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.9">As a side-effect of creating a mapping, ICMP messages associated with the mapping MUST be forwarded (and also translated, if appropriate) for the duration of the mapping's lifetime. This is done to ensure that ICMP messages can still be used by hosts, without application programmers or PCP client implementations needing to signal PCP separately to create ICMP mappings for those flows.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.6">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.6">9.6.</a> <a href="#renumbering" id="renumbering">Address Change Events</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.6.p.1">A customer premises router might obtain a new IP address, for a variety of reasons including a reboot, power outage, DHCP lease expiry, or other action by the ISP. If this occurs, traffic forwarded to the host's previous address might be delivered to another host which now has that address. This affects both implicit dynamic mappings and explicit dynamic mappings. However, this same problem already occurs today when a host's IP address is re-assigned, without PCP and without an ISP-operated CGN. The solution is the same as today: the problems associated with host renumbering are caused by host renumbering and are eliminated if host renumbering is avoided.  PCP defined in this document does not provide machinery to reduce the host renumbering problem.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.6.p.2">When an Internal Host changes its IP address (e.g., by having a different address assigned by the DHCP server) the NAT (or firewall) will continue to send traffic to the old IP address. Typically, the Internal Host will no longer receive traffic sent to that old IP address. Assuming the Internal Host wants to continue receiving traffic, it needs to install new mappings for its new IP address. The suggested external port field will not be fulfilled by the PCP server, in all likelihood, because it is still being forwarded to the old IP address. Thus, a mapping is likely to be assigned a new external port number and/or public IP address. Note that such host renumbering is not expected to happen routinely on a regular basis for most hosts, since most hosts renew their DHCP leases before they expire (or re-request the same address after reboot) and most DHCP servers honor such requests and grant the host the same address it was previously using before the reboot.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.6.p.3">A host might gain or lose interfaces while existing mappings are active (e.g., Ethernet cable plugged in or removed, joining/leaving a WiFi network). Because of this, if the PCP client is sending a PCP request to maintain state in the PCP server, it SHOULD ensure those PCP requests continue to use the same interface (e.g., when refreshing mappings). If the PCP client is sending a PCP request to create new state in the PCP server, it MAY use a different source interface or different source address.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.7">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.7">9.7.</a> Learning the External IP Address Alone</h1>
<p><a href="#I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp">NAT-PMP</a> <cite title="NONE">[I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp]</cite> includes a mechanism to allow clients to learn the External IP Address alone, without also requesting a port mapping. In the case of PCP, this operation no longer makes sense. PCP supports Large Scale NATs (CGN) which may have a pool of External IP Addresses, not just one. A client may not be assigned any particular External IP Address from that pool until it has made at least one implicit or explicit port mapping, and even then only for as long as that implicit or explicit port mapping remains valid.  Client software that just wishes to display the user's External IP Address for cosmetic purposes can achieve that by requesting a short-lived mapping and then displaying the resulting External IP Address.  However, once that mapping expires a subsequent implicit or explicit dynamic mapping might be mapped to a different external IP address.</p>

<dd style="margin-left: 8">If sent before, this is considered a PEER-created mapping which creates a new dynamic mapping in the PCP-controlled device, which will be used for translating traffic to and from the remote peer; this mapping functions the same as if an implicit dynamic mapping were created (e.g., because of a TCP SYN from the client).  This is useful for restoring a mapping after a NAT has lost its implicit mapping state (e.g., due to a crash).  Note that some PCP servers and some PCP-controlled devices are expected to not support this functionality and will respond with a PCP error.</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">If sent after, this is considered an "implicit dynamic mapping".  This allows the client to learn the IP address, port, and lifetime of the assigned External Address and Port for the implicit mapping, and to extend this lifetime (for the purpose described in <a href="#keepalives">Section 8.3</a>).</dd>
</dl>
<p id="rfc.section.10.2.p.3">The PEER Opcode contains a Remote Peer Address field, which is always from the perspective of the PCP client.  Note that when the PCP-controlled device is performing address family translation (NAT46 or NAT64), the remote peer address from the perspective of the PCP client is different from the remote peer address on the other side of the address family translation device.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.10.3">10.3.</a> <a href="#peer-opcode_server_operation" id="peer-opcode_server_operation">Processing a PEER Request</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.10.3.p.1">This section describes the operation of a server when receiving a request with the PEER Opcode.  Processing SHOULD be performed in the order of the following paragraphs.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.3.p.2">The following fields from a PEER request are copied into the response:  Protocol, Internal Port, Remote Peer IP Address, and Remote Peer Port.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.3.p.3">When an implicit dynamic mapping is created, some NATs and firewalls validate destination addresses and will not create an implicit dynamic mapping if the destination address is invalid (e.g., 127.0.0.1).  If a PCP-controlled device does such validation for implicit dynamic mappings, it SHOULD also do a similar validation of the Remote Peer IP Address and Port for PEER-created implicit dynamic mappings.  If the validation determines the Remote Peer IP Address of a PEER request is invalid, then no mapping is created, and a MALFORMED_REQUEST error result is returned.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.3.p.4">On receiving the PEER Opcode, the PCP server examines the mapping table. If the requested mapping does not yet exist, and the Suggested External Address and Port can be honored, the mapping is created.  By having PEER create such a mapping, we avoid a race condition between the PEER request or the initial outgoing packet arriving at the NAT gateway first, and allow PEER to be used to recreate an implicit dynamic mapping (see last paragraph of <a href="#reboot">Section 12.3.1</a>).  If the requested mapping does not yet exist, but Suggested External Address and Port cannot be honored, the error CANNOT_PROVIDE_EXTERNAL_PORT is returned.  If the requested mapping already exists, it is a request to modify that existing mapping.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.3.p.5">The PEER Opcode MAY reduce the lifetime of an existing implicit dynamic mapping created by PEER; this is implementation-dependent.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.3.p.6">If the PCP-controlled device can extend the lifetime of a mapping, the PCP server uses the smaller of its configured maximum lifetime value and the requested lifetime from the PEER request, and sets the lifetime to that value.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.3.p.7">If all of the preceding operations were successful (did not generate an error response), then a SUCCESS response is generated, with the Lifetime field containing the lifetime of the mapping.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.3.p.8">After a successful PEER response is sent, it is implementation-specific if the PCP-controlled device destroys the mapping when the lifetime expires, or if the PCP-controlled device's implementation allows traffic to keep the mapping alive. Thus, if the PCP client wants the mapping to persist beyond the lifetime reported in the response, it MUST refresh the mapping (by sending another PEER message) prior to the expiration of the lifetime. If the mapping is terminated by the TCP client or server (e.g., TCP FIN or TCP RST), the mapping will be destroyed normally; the mapping will not persist for the time indicated by Lifetime. This means the Lifetime in a PEER response indicates how long the mapping will persist in the absence of a transport termination message (e.g., TCP RST).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.3.p.9">Some transport protocols signal the end of a connection (e.g., TCP FIN, TCP RST, SCTP SHUTDOWN).  After a successful PEER response is sent, the receipt of such a transport-specific message MUST NOT cause the mapping to be destroyed.  Rather, the mapping is maintained until the PEER-signaled lifetime expires.  If the PCP client wishes to terminate the mapping prior to this, it will send a PEER request with Lifetime set to 0, which MAY be honored by the PCP server; as stated earlier, that is implementation-dependent.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.10.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.10.4">10.4.</a> Processing a PEER Response</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.10.4.p.1">This section describes the operation of a client when processing a response with the PEER Opcode.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.4.p.2">After performing common PCP response processing, the response is further matched with a request by comparing the protocol, internal IP address, internal port, remote peer address and remote peer port.  Other fields are not compared, because the PCP server changes those fields to provide information about the mapping created by the Opcode.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.4.p.3">On a successful response, the application can use the assigned lifetime value to reduce its frequency of application keepalives for that particular NAT mapping. Of course, there may be other reasons, specific to the application, to use more frequent application keepalives. For example, the PCP assigned lifetime could be one hour but the application may want to maintain state on its server (e.g., "busy" / "away") more frequently than once an hour.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.4.p.4">If the PCP client wishes to keep this mapping alive beyond the indicated lifetime, it SHOULD issue a new PCP request prior to the expiration. That is, inside-&gt;outside traffic is not sufficient to ensure the mapping will continue to exist. See <a href="#renewal">Section 9.2.1</a> for recommended renewal timing.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.4">A THIRD_PARTY Option MUST NOT contain the same address as the source address of the packet. A PCP server receiving a THIRD_PARTY Option specifying the same address as the source address of the packet MUST return a MALFORMED_REQUEST result code. This is because many PCP servers may not implement the THIRD_PARTY Option at all, and a client using the THIRD_PARTY Option to specify the same address as the source address of the packet will cause mapping requests to fail where they would otherwise have succeeded.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.5">A PCP server MAY be configured to permit or to prohibit the use of the THIRD_PARTY Option. If this Option is permitted, properly authorized clients may perform these operations on behalf of other hosts. If this Option is prohibited, and a PCP server receives a PCP MAP request with a THIRD_PARTY Option, it MUST generate a UNSUPP_OPTION response.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.6">It is RECOMMENDED that customer premises equipment implementing a PCP Server be configured to prohibit third party mappings by default.  With this default, if a user wants to create a third party mapping, the user needs to interact out-of-band with their customer premises router (e.g., using its HTTP administrative interface).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.7">It is RECOMMENDED that service provider NAT and firewall devices implementing a PCP Server be configured to permit the THIRD_PARTY Option, when sent by a properly authorized host. If the packet arrives from an unauthorized host, the PCP server MUST generate an UNSUPP_OPTION error.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.8">Determining which PCP clients are authorized to use the THIRD_PARTY Option for which other hosts is deployment-dependent. For example, an ISP using Dual-Stack Lite could choose to allow a client connecting over a given IPv6 tunnel to manage mappings for any other host connecting over the same IPv6 tunnel, or the ISP could choose to allow only the DS-Lite B4 element to manage mappings for other hosts connecting over the same IPv6 tunnel. A cryptographic authentication and authorization model is outside the scope of this specification. Note that the THIRD_PARTY Option is not needed for today's common scenario of an ISP offering a single IP address to a customer who is using NAT to share that address locally, since in this scenario all the customer's hosts appear to be a single host from the point of view of the ISP.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.9">Where possible, it may beneficial if a client using the THIRD_PARTY Option to create and maintain mappings on behalf of some other device can take steps to verify that the other device is still present and active on the network. Otherwise the client using the THIRD_PARTY Option to maintain mappings on behalf of some other device risks maintaining those mappings forever, long after the device that required them has gone. This would defeat the purpose of PCP mappings having a finite lifetime so that they can be automatically deleted after they are no longer needed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.10">A PCP client can delete all PCP-created explicit dynamic mappings (i.e., those created by PCP MAP requests) that it is authorized to delete by sending a PCP MAP request including a zero-length THIRD_PARTY Option.</p>

PCP servers that are not intended to support downstream devices that perform UPnP IGD interworking are not required to support this Option. PCP clients other than UPnP IGD interworking clients SHOULD NOT use this Option because it results in inefficient operation, and they cannot safely assume that all PCP servers will implement it.

After processing this MAP request containing the FILTER Option and generating a successful response, the PCP-controlled device will drop packets received on its public-facing interface that don't match the filter fields. After dropping the packet, if its security policy allows, the PCP-controlled device MAY also generate an ICMP error in response to the dropped packet.</p>

<li>Maximum occurrences: as many as fit within maximum PCP message size</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.11.3.p.5">The Prefix Length indicates how many bits of the IPv6 address or IPv4 address are used for the filter.  For IPv4 addresses, which are represented using the IPv4-mapped address format (::FFFF:0:0/96), the value of the Prefix Length pertains only to to the IPv4 portion of the address.  Thus, a Prefix Length of 32 with an IPv4-mapped address indicates "only this address".  With IPv4-mapped addresses, the minimum Prefix length value is 0 and the maximum is 32; for IPv6 addresses the minimum value is 0 and the maximum is 128.  Values outside those range cause the PCP server to return the MALFORMED_OPTION result code.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.3.p.6">If multiple occurrences of the FILTER Option exist in the same MAP request, they are processed in the same order received (as per normal PCP Option processing) and they MAY overlap the filtering requested. If an existing mapping exists (with or without a filter) and the server receives a MAP request with FILTER, the filters indicated in the new request are added to any existing filters. If a MAP request has a lifetime of 0 and contains the FILTER Option, the error MALFORMED_OPTION is returned.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.3.p.7">If any of occurrences of the FILTER Option in a request packet are not successfully processed then an error is returned (e.g., MALFORMED_OPTION if one of the Options was malformed) and as with other PCP errors, returning an error causes no state to be changed in the PCP server or in the PCP-controlled device.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.3.p.8">To remove all existing filters, the Prefix Length 0 is used. There is no mechanism to remove a specific filter.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.3.p.9">To change an existing filter, the PCP client sends a MAP request containing two FILTER Options, the first Option containing a Prefix Length of 0 (to delete all existing filters) and the second containing the new remote peer's IP address and port. Other FILTER Options in that PCP request, if any, add more allowed Remote Peers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.3.p.10">The PCP server or the PCP-controlled device is expected to have a limit on the number of remote peers it can support. This limit might be as small as one. If a MAP request would exceed this limit, the entire MAP request is rejected with the result code EXCESSIVE_REMOTE_PEERS, and the state on the PCP server is unchanged.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.3.p.11">All PCP servers MUST support at least one filter per MAP mapping.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.3.p.12">The use of the FILTER Option can be seen as a performance optimization. Since all software using PCP to receive incoming connections also has to deal with the case where may be directly connected to the Internet and receive unrestricted incoming TCP connections and UDP packets, if it wishes to restrict incoming traffic to a specific source address or group of source addresses such software already needs to check the source address of incoming traffic and reject unwanted traffic. However, the FILTER Option is a particularly useful performance optimization for battery powered wireless devices, because it can enable them to conserve battery power by not having to wake up just to reject a unwanted traffic.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.12.1.p.2">For implicit dynamic mappings, some existing NAT devices have endpoint-independent mapping (EIM) behavior while other NAT devices have endpoint-dependent mapping (EDM) behavior. NATs which have EIM behavior do not suffer from the problem described in this section. The IETF strongly encourages EIM behavior <a href="#RFC4787">[RFC4787]</a><a href="#RFC5382">[RFC5382]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.12.1.p.3">In such EDM NAT devices, the same external port may be used by an implicit dynamic mapping (from the same Internal Host or from a different Internal Host) and an explicit dynamic mapping. This complicates the interaction with the MAP Opcode.  With such NAT devices, there are two ways envisioned to implement the MAP Opcode: </p>

<ol>
<li>Have implicit dynamic mappings use a different set of public ports than explicit dynamic mappings (e.g., those created with MAP), thus reducing the interaction problem between them; or</li>
<li>On arrival of a packet (inbound from the Internet or outbound from an Internal Host), first attempt to use an implicit dynamic mapping to process that packet. If none match, then the incoming packet should use the explicit dynamic mapping to process that packet. This effectively 'prioritizes' implicit dynamic mappings above explicit dynamic mappings.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.12.2.p.2">No matter if a NAT is EIM or EDM, it is possible that one (or more) implicit dynamic mappings, using the same internal port on the Internal Host, might be created before or after a MAP request. When this occurs, it is important that the NAT honor the Lifetime returned in the MAP response. Specifically, if a mapping was created with the MAP Opcode, the implementation needs to ensure that termination of an implicit dynamic mapping (e.g., via a TCP FIN handshake) does not prematurely destroy the MAP-created mapping. On a NAT that implements endpoint-independent mapping with endpoint-independent filtering, this could be implemented by extending the lifetime of the implicit dynamic mapping to the lifetime of the explicit dynamic mapping.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.12.3.p.2">If an event occurs that causes the PCP server to lose explicit dynamic mapping state (such as a crash or power outage), the mappings created by PCP are lost. Such loss of state is expected to be rare in a service provider environment (due to redundant power, disk drives for storage, etc.), but more common in a residential NAT device which does not write this information to non-volatile memory. Of course, due to outright failure of service provider equipment (e.g., software malfunction), state may still be lost.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.12.3.1.p.2">A mapping renewal packet is formatted identically to an original mapping request; from the point of view of the client it is a renewal of an existing mapping, but from the point of view of a newly rebooted PCP server it appears as a new mapping request. In the normal process of routinely renewing its mappings before they expire, a PCP client will automatically recreate all its lost mappings.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.12.3.1.p.3">When the PCP server loses state and begins processing new PCP messages, its Epoch is reset and begins counting again from zero (per the procedure of <a href="#epoch">Section 7.5</a>).

<p id="rfc.section.12.3.2.p.2">A PCP client refreshes a mapping by sending a new PCP request containing information from the earlier PCP response. The PCP server will respond indicating the new lifetime. It is possible, due to reconfiguration or failure of the PCP server, that the public IP address and/or public port, or the PCP server itself, has changed (due to a new route to a different PCP server). To detect such events more quickly, the PCP client may find it beneficial to use shorter lifetimes (so that it communicates with the PCP server more often). If the PCP client has several mappings, the Epoch value only needs to be retrieved for one of them to verify the PCP server has not lost explicit dynamic mapping state.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.12.3.2.p.3">If the client wishes to check the PCP server's Epoch, it sends a PCP request for any one of the client's mappings. This will return the current Epoch value. In that request the PCP client could extend the mapping lifetime (by asking for more time) or maintain the current lifetime (by asking for the same number of seconds that it knows are remaining of the lifetime).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.12.3.2.p.4">If a PCP client changes its Internal IP Address (e.g., because the Internal Host has moved to a new network), and the PCP client wishes to still receive incoming traffic, it needs create new mappings on that new network. New mappings will typically also require an update to the application-specific rendezvous server if the External Address or Port are different to the previous values (see <a href="#operating_a_server">Section 8.1</a> and <a href="#renumbering">Section 9.6</a>).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.12.3.3.p.1">Although SCTP has port numbers like TCP and UDP, SCTP works differently when behind an address-sharing NAT, in that SCTP port numbers are not changed <a href="#I-D.ietf-behave-sctpnat">[I-D.ietf-behave-sctpnat]</a>.  Because implicit dynamic SCTP mappings use the verification tag of the association instead of the local and remote peer port numbers, explicit dynamic SCTP mappings need only be established by passive listeners expecting to receive new associations at the external port.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.12.3.3.p.2">Because an SCTP-aware NAT does not rewrite SCTP port numbers (and firewalls never do), a PCP MAP or PEER request for an SCTP mapping SHOULD provide the same Internal Port and Requested External Port.  If the PCP server supports SCTP, and the requested external port cannot be provided in an explicit dynamic SCTP mapping, then the error CANNOT_PROVIDE_EXTERNAL_PORT is returned.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.14.p.1">The goal of the PCP protocol is to improve the ability of end nodes to control their associated NAT state, and to improve the efficiency and error handling of NAT mappings when compared to existing implicit mapping mechanisms in NAT boxes and stateful firewalls.  It is the security goal of the PCP protocol to limit any new denial of service opportunities, and to avoid introducing new attacks that can result in unauthorized changes to mapping state.  One of the most serious consequences of unauthorized changes in mapping state is traffic theft.  All mappings that could be created by a specific host using implicit mapping mechanisms are inherently considered to be authorized.  Confidentiality of mappings is not a requirement, even in cases where the PCP messages may transit paths that would not be travelled by the mapped traffic.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.14.1.p.3">A PCP Server is secure under this threat model if the PCP Server is constrained so that it does not configure any explicit mapping that it would not configure implicitly.  In most cases, this means that PCP Servers running on NAT boxes or stateful firewalls that support the PEER Opcode can be secure under this threat model if all of their hosts are within a single administrative domain (or if the internal hosts can be securely partitioned into separate administrative domains, as in the DS-Lite B4 case), explicit mappings are created with the same lifetime as implicit mappings, the PCP server does not support deleting or reducing the lifetime of existing mappings, and the PCP server does not support the third party option. PCP Servers can also securely support the MAP Opcode under this threat model if the security policy on the device running the PCP Server would permit endpoint independent filtering of implicit mappings.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you allow multiple administrative domains to send PCP requests to a single PCP server that does not enforce a boundary between the domains, it is possible for a node in one domain to perform a denial of service attack on other domains, or to capture traffic that is intended for a node in another domain.</li>
<li>If explicit mappings have longer lifetimes than implicit mappings, it makes it easier to perpetrate a denial of service attack than it would be if the PCP Server was not present.</li>
<li>If the PCP Server supports deleting or reducing the lifetime of existing mappings, this allows an attacking node to steal an existing mapping and receive traffic that was intended for another node.</li>
<li>If the THIRD_PARTY Option is supported, this also allows an attacker to open a window for an external node to attack an internal node, allows an attacker to steal traffic that was intended for another node, or may facilitate a denial of service attack.  One example of how the THIRD_PARTY Option could grant an attacker more capability than a spoofed implicit mapping is that the PCP server (especially if it is running in a service provider's network) may not be aware of internal filtering that would prevent spoofing an equivalent implicit mapping, such as filtering between a guest and corporate network.</li>
<li>If the MAP Opcode is supported by the PCP server in cases where the security policy would not support endpoint independent filtering of implicit mappings, then the MAP Opcode changes the security properties of the device running the PCP Server by allowing explicit mappings that violate the security policy.</li>

The B4 device MUST guard against spoofed packets being injected into the IPv6 tunnel using the B4 device's IPv4 source address, so the DS-Lite PCP Server can trust that packets received over the DS-Lite IPv6 tunnel with the B4 device's source IPv4 address do in fact originate from the B4 device.

This means incoming traffic will be sent to a different host ("theft").  A mechanism to immediately inform the PCP client of state loss would reduce this interval, but would not eliminate this threat.  The PCP client can reduce this interval by using a relatively short lifetime; however, this increases the amount of PCP chatter.  This threat is reduced by using persistent storage of explicit dynamic mappings in the PCP server (so it does not lose explicit dynamic mapping state), or by ensuring the previous external IP address and port cannot be used by another host (e.g., by using a different IP address pool).</p>

<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20A">Appendix A.</a> NAT-PMP Transition</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.p.1">The Port Control Protocol (PCP) is a successor to the NAT Port Mapping Protocol, <a href="#I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp">NAT-PMP</a> <cite title="NONE">[I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp]</cite>, and shares similar semantics, concepts, and packet formats. Because of this NAT-PMP and PCP both use the same port, and use NAT-PMP and PCP's version negotiation capabilities to determine which version to use. This section describes how an orderly transition may be achieved.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.p.2">A client supporting both NAT-PMP and PCP SHOULD send its request using the PCP packet format. This will be received by a NAT-PMP server or a PCP server. If received by a NAT-PMP server, the response will be as indicated by <a href="#I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp">the NAT-PMP specification</a> <cite title="NONE">[I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp]</cite>, which will cause the client to downgrade to NAT-PMP and re-send its request in NAT-PMP format. If received by a PCP server, the response will be as described by this document and processing continues as expected.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.p.3">A PCP server supporting both NAT-PMP and PCP can handle requests in either format. The first octet of the packet indicates if it is NAT-PMP (first octet zero) or PCP (first octet non-zero).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.p.4">A PCP-only gateway receiving a NAT-PMP request (identified by the first octet being zero) will interpret the request as a version mismatch.  Normal PCP processing will emit a PCP response that is compatible with NAT-PMP, without any special handling by the PCP server.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.p.1">[Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section prior to publication.]</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix B.1">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20B.1">Appendix B.1.</a> Changes from draft-ietf-pcp-base-14 to -15</h1>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Softened and removed text that was normatively explaining how PEER is implemented within a NAT.</li>
<li>Allow a MAP request for protocol=0, which means "all protocols".  This can work for an IPv6 or IPv4 firewall.  Its use with a NAPT is undefined.</li>
<li>combined SERVER_OVERLOADED and NO_RESOURCES into one error code, NO_RESOURCES.</li>
<li>SCTP mappings have to use same internal and requested external ports, and have implied PREFER_FAILURE semantics.</li>
<li>Re-instated ADDRESS_MISMATCH error, which only checks the client address (not its port).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix B.2">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20B.2">Appendix B.2.</a> Changes from draft-ietf-pcp-base-13 to -14</h1>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Moved discussion of socket operations for PCP source address into Implementation Considerations section.</li>
<li>Integrated numerous WGLC comments.</li>
<li>NPTv6 in scope.</li>
<li>Re-written security considerations section.  Thanks, Margaret!</li>
<li>Reduced PEER4 and PEER6 Opcodes to just a single Opcode, PEER.</li>
<li>Reduced MAP4 and MAP6 Opcodes to just a single Opcode, MAP.</li>
<li>Rearranged the PEER packet formats to align with MAP.</li>
<li>Removed discussion of the "O" bit for Options, which was confusing.  Now the text just discusses the most significant bit of the Option code which indicates mandatory/optional, so it is clearer the field is 8 bits.</li>
<li>The THIRD_PARTY Option from an unauthorized host generates UNSUPP_OPTION, so the PCP server doesn't disclose it knows how to process THIRD_PARTY Option.</li>
<li>Added table to show which fields of MAP or PEER need IPv6/IPv4 addresses for IPv4 firewall, DS-Lite, NAT64, NAT44, etc.</li>
<li>Accommodate the server's Epoch going up or down, to better detect switching to a different PCP server.</li>
<li>Removed ADDRESS_MISMATCH; the server always includes its idea of the Client's IP Address and Port, and it's up to the client to detect a mismatch (and rectify it).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix B.3">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20B.3">Appendix B.3.</a> Changes from draft-ietf-pcp-base-12 to -13</h1>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>All addresses are 128 bits.  IPv4 addresses are represented by IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses (::FFFF/96)</li>
<li>PCP request header now includes PCP client's port (in addition to the client's IP address, which was in -12).</li>
<li>new ADDRESS_MISMATCH error.</li>
<li>removed PROCESSING_ERROR error, which was too similar to MALFORMED_REQUEST.</li>
<li>Tweaked text describing how PCP client deals with multiple PCP server addresses (<a href="#general_generate_request">Section 7.1</a>)</li>
<li>clarified that when overloaded, the server can send SERVER_OVERLOADED (and drop requests) or simply drop requests.</li>
<li>Clarified how PCP client chooses MAP4 or MAP6, depending on the presence of its own IPv6 or IPv4 interfaces (<a href="#opcode_introduction">Section 8</a>).</li>
<li>compliant PCP server MUST support MAPx and PEERx, SHOULD support ability to disable support.</li>
<li>clarified that MAP-created mappings have no filtering, and PEER-created mappings have whatever filtering and mapping behavior is normal for that particular NAT / firewall.</li>
<li>Integrated WGLC feedback (small changes to abstract, definitions, and small edits throughout the document)</li>
<li>allow new Options to be defined with a specification (rather than standards action)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix B.4">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20B.4">Appendix B.4.</a> Changes from draft-ietf-pcp-base-11 to -12</h1>

<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20B.5">Appendix B.5.</a> Changes from draft-ietf-pcp-base-10 to -11</h1>

<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix B.6">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20B.6">Appendix B.6.</a> Changes from draft-ietf-pcp-base-09 to -10</h1>
<p></p>

<ul><li>Added External_AF field to PEER requests. Made PEER's Suggested External IP Address and Assigned External IP Address always be 128 bits long.</li></ul>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix B.7">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20B.7">Appendix B.7.</a> Changes from draft-ietf-pcp-base-08 to -09</h1>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Clarified in PEER Opcode introduction (<a href="#peer_opcodes">Section 10</a>) that they can also create mappings.</li>
<li>More clearly explained how PEER can re-create an implicit dynamic mapping, for purposes of rebuilding state to maintain an existing session (e.g., long-lived TCP connection to a server).</li>
<li>Added Suggested External IP Address to the PEER Opcodes, to allow more robust rebuilding of connections. Added related text to the PEER server processing section.</li>
<li>Removed text encouraging PCP server to statefully remember its mappings from <a href="#reboot">Section 12.3.1</a>, as it didn't belong there. Text in Security Considerations already encourages persistent storage.</li>
<li>More clearly discussed how PEER is used to re-establish TCP mapping state. Moved it to a new section, as well (it is now <a href="#restoring">Section 8.4</a>).</li>
<li>MAP errors now copy the Requested IP Address (and port) fields to Assigned IP Address (and port), to allow PCP client to distinguish among many outstanding requests when using PREFER_FAILURE.</li>
<li>Mapping theft can also be mitigated by ensuring hosts can't re-use same IP address or port after state loss.</li>
<li>the UNPROCESSED option is renumbered to 0 (zero), which ensures no other option will be given 0 and be unable to be expressed by the UNPROCESSED option (due to its 0 padding).</li>
<li>created new Implementation Considerations section (<a href="#implementation_considerations">Section 12</a>) which discusses non-normative things that might be useful to implementors. Some new text is in here, and the Failure Scenarios text (<a href="#failure">Section 12.3</a>) has been moved to here.</li>
<li>Tweaked wording of EDM NATs in <a href="#EDM">Section 12.1</a> to clarify the problem occurs both inside-&gt;outside and outside-&gt;inside.</li>
<li>removed "Interference by Other Applications on Same Host" section from security considerations.</li>
<li>fixed zero/non-zero text in <a href="#lifetime">Section 9.5</a>.</li>
<li>removed duplicate text saying MAP is allowed to delete an implicit dynamic mapping. It is still allowed to do that, but it didn't need to be said twice in the same paragraph.</li>
<li>Renamed error from UNAUTH_TARGET_ADDRESS to UNAUTH_THIRD_PARTY_INTERNAL_ADDRESS.</li>
<li>for FILTER option, removed unnecessary detail on how FILTER would be bad for PEER, as it is only allowed for MAP anyway.</li>
<li>In Security Considerations, explain that PEER can create a mapping which makes its security considerations the same as MAP.</li>
</ul>

<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20B.8">Appendix B.8.</a> Changes from draft-ietf-pcp-base-07 to -08</h1>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>moved all MAP4-, MAP6-, and PEER-specific options into a single section.</li>
<li>discussed NAT port-overloading and its impact on MAP (new section <a href="#EDM">Section 12.1</a>), which allowed removing the IMPLICIT_MAPPING_EXISTS error.</li>
<li>eliminated NONEXIST_PEER error (which was returned if a PEER request was received without an implicit dynamic mapping already being created), and adjusted PEER so that it creates an implicit dynamic mapping.</li>
<li>Removed Deployment Scenarios section (which detailed NAT64, NAT44, Dual-Stack Lite, etc.).</li>
<li>Added Client's IP Address to PCP common header. This allows server to refuse a PCP request if there is a mismatch with the source IP address, such as when a non-PCP-aware NAT was on the path. This should reduce failure situations where PCP is deployed in conjunction with a non-PCP-aware NAT. This addition was consensus at IETF80.</li>
<li>Changed UNSPECIFIED_ERROR to PROCESSING_ERROR. Clarified that MALFORMED_REQUEST is for malformed requests (and not related to failed attempts to process the request).</li>
<li>Removed MISORDERED_OPTIONS. Consensus of IETF80.</li>
<li>SERVER_OVERLOADED is now a common PCP error (instead of specific to MAP).</li>
<li>Tweaked PCP retransmit/retry algorithm again, to allow more aggressive PCP discovery if an implementation wants to do that.</li>
<li>Version negotiation text tweaked to soften NAT-PMP reference, and more clearly explain exactly what UNSUPP_VERSION should return.</li>
<li>PCP now uses NAT-PMP's UDP port, 5351. There are no normative changes to NAT-PMP or PCP to allow them both to use the same port number.</li>
<li>New Appendix A to discuss NAT-PMP / PCP interworking.</li>
<li>improved pseudocode to be non-blocking.</li>
<li>clarified that PCP cannot delete a static mapping (i.e., a mapping created by CLI or other non-PCP means).</li>
<li>moved theft of mapping discussion from Epoch section to Security Considerations.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix B.9">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20B.9">Appendix B.9.</a> Changes from draft-ietf-pcp-base-06 to -07</h1>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>tightened up THIRD_PARTY security discussion. Removed "highest numbered address", and left it as simply "the CPE's IP address".</li>
<li>removed UNABLE_TO_DELETE_ALL error.</li>
<li>renumbered Opcodes</li>
<li>renumbered some error codes</li>
<li>assigned value to IMPLICIT_MAPPING_EXISTS.</li>
<li>UNPROCESSED can include arbitrary number of option codes.</li>
<li>Moved lifetime fields into common request/response headers</li>
<li>We've noticed we're having to repeatedly explain to people that the "requested port" is merely a hint, and the NAT gateway is free to ignore it. Changed name to "suggested port" to better convey this intention.</li>
<li>Added NAT-PMP transition section</li>
<li>Separated Internal Address, External Address, Remote Peer Address definition</li>
<li>Unified Mapping, Port Mapping, Port Forwarding definition</li>
<li>adjusted so DHCP configuration is non-normative.</li>
<li>mentioned PCP refreshes need to be sent over the same interface.</li>
<li>renamed the REMOTE_PEER_FILTER option to FILTER.</li>
<li>Clarified FILTER option to allow sending an ICMP error if policy allows.</li>
<li>for MAP, clarified that if the PCP client changed its IP address and still wants to receive traffic, it needs to send a new MAP request.</li>
<li>clarified that PEER requests have to be sent from same interface as the connection itself.</li>
<li>for MAP opcode, text now requires mapping be deleted when lifetime expires (per consensus on 8-Mar interim meeting)</li>
<li>PEER Opcode: better description of remote peer's IP address, specifically that it does not control or establish any filtering, and explaining why it is 'from the PCP client's perspective'.</li>
<li>Removed latent text allowing DMZ for 'all protocols' (protocol=0). Which wouldn't have been legal, anyway, as protocol 0 is assigned by IANA to HOPOPT (thanks to James Yu for catching that one).</li>
<li>clarified that PCP server only listens on its internal interface.</li>
<li>abandoned 'target' term and reverted to simplier 'internal' term.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix B.10">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20B.10">Appendix B.10.</a> Changes from draft-ietf-pcp-base-05 to -06</h1>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Dual-Stack Lite: consensus was encapsulation mode. Included a suggestion that the B4 will need to proxy PCP-to-PCP and UPnP-to-PCP.</li>
<li>defined THIRD_PARTY Option to work with the PEER Opcode, too.  This meant moving it to its own section, and having both MAP and PEER Opcodes reference that common section.</li>
<li>used "target" instead of "internal", in the hopes that clarifies internal address used by PCP itself (for sending its packets) versus the address for MAPpings.</li>
<li>Options are now required to be ordered in requests, and ordering has to be validated by the server. Intent is to ease server processing of mandatory-to-implement options.</li>
<li>Swapped Option values for the mandatory- and optional-to-process Options, so we can have a simple lowest..highest ordering.</li>
<li>added MISORDERED_OPTIONS error.</li>
<li>re-ordered some error messages to cause MALFORMED_REQUEST (which is PCP's most general error response) to be error 1, instead of buried in the middle of the error numbers.</li>
<li>clarified that, after successfully using a PCP server, that PCP server is declared to be non-responsive after 5 failed retransmissions.</li>
<li>tightened up text (which was inaccurate) about how long general PCP processing is to delay when receiving an error and if it should honor Opcode-specific error lifetime. Useful for MAP errors which have an error lifetime. (This all feels awkward to have only some errors with a lifetime.)</li>
<li>Added better discussion of multiple interfaces, including highlighting WiFi+Ethernet. Added discussion of using IPv6 Privacy Addresses and RFC1918 as source addresses for PCP requests. This should finish the section on multi-interface issues.</li>
<li>added some text about why server might send SERVER_OVERLOADED, or might simply discard packets.</li>
<li>Dis-allow internal-port=0, which means we dis-allow using PCP as a DMZ-like function. Instead, ports have to be mapped individually.</li>
<li>Text describing server's processing of PEER is tightened up.</li>
<li>Server's processing of PEER now says it is implementation-specific if a PCP server continues to allow the mapping to exist after a PEER message. Client's processing of PEER says that if client wants mapping to continue to exist, client has to continue to send recurring PEER messages.</li>

<ul>
<li>tweaked PCP common header packet layout.</li>
<li>Re-added port=0 (all ports).</li>
<li>minimum size is 12 octets (missed that change in -04).</li>
<li>removed Lifetime from PCP common header.</li>
<li>for MAP error responses, the lifetime indicates how long the server wants the client to avoid retrying the request.</li>
<li>More clearly indicated which fields are filled by the server on success responses and error responses.</li>
<li>Removed UPnP interworking section from this document. It will appear in <a href="#I-D.bpw-pcp-upnp-igd-interworking">[I-D.bpw-pcp-upnp-igd-interworking]</a>.</li>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>"Pinhole" and "PIN" changed to "mapping" and "MAP".</li>
<li>Reduced from four MAP Opcodes to two. This was done by implicitly using the address family of the PCP message itself.</li>
<li>New option THIRD_PARTY, to more carefully split out the case where a mapping is created to a different host within the home.</li>
<li>Integrated a lot of editorial changes from Stuart and Francis.</li>
<li>Removed nested NAT text into another document, including the IANA-registered IP addresses for the PCP server.</li>
<li>Removed suggestion (MAY) that PCP server reserve UDP when it maps TCP. Nobody seems to need that.</li>
<li>Clearly added NAT and NAPT, such as in residential NATs, as within scope for PCP.</li>
<li>HONOR_EXTERNAL_PORT renamed to PREFER_FAILURE</li>
<li>Added 'Lifetime' field to the common PCP header, which replaces the functions of the 'temporary' and 'permanent' error types of the previous version.</li>
<li>Allow arbitrary Options to be included in PCP response, so that PCP server can indicate un-supported PCP Options. Satisfies PCP Issue #19</li>
<li>Reduced scope to only deal with mapping protocols that have port numbers.</li>
<li>Reduced scope to not support DMZ-style forwarding.</li>
<li>Clarified version negotiation.</li>
</ul>

<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20B.13">Appendix B.13.</a> Changes from draft-ietf-pcp-base-02 to -03</h1>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Adjusted abstract and introduction to make it clear PCP is intended to forward ports and intended to reduce application keepalives.</li>
<li>First bit in PCP common header is set. This allows DTLS and non-DTLS to be multiplexed on same port, should a future update to this specification add DTLS support.</li>
<li>Moved subscriber identity from common PCP section to MAP* section.</li>
<li>made clearer that PCP client can reduce mapping lifetime if it wishes.</li>
<li>Added discussion of host running a server, client, or symmetric client+server.</li>
<li>Introduced PEER4 and PEER6 Opcodes.</li>
<li>Removed REMOTE_PEER Option, as its function has been replaced by the new PEER Opcodes.</li>
<li>IANA assigned port 44323 to PCP.</li>
<li>Removed AMBIGUOUS error code, which is no longer needed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>more error codes</li>
<li>PCP client source port number should be random</li>
<li>PCP message minimum 8 octets, maximum 1024 octets.</li>
<li>tweaked a lot of text in section 7.4, "Opcode-Specific Server Operation".</li>
<li>opening a mapping also allows ICMP messages associated with that mapping.</li>
<li>PREFER_FAILURE value changed to the mandatory-to-process range.</li>
<li>added text recommending applications that are crashing obtain short lifetimes, to avoid consuming subscriber's port quota.</li>
</ul>

<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20B.15">Appendix B.15.</a> Changes from draft-ietf-pcp-base-00 to -01</h1>

<ul>
<li>Significant document reorganization, primarily to split base PCP operation from Opcode operation.</li>
<li>packet format changed to move 'protocol' outside of PCP common header and into the MAP* opcodes</li>
<li>Renamed Informational Elements (IE) to Options.</li>
<li>Added REMOTE_PEER (for disambiguation with dynamic ports), REMOTE_PEER_FILTER (for simple packet filtering), and PREFER_FAILURE (to optimize UPnP IGD interworking) options.</li>
<li>Is NAT or router behind B4 in scope?</li>
<li>PCP option MAY be included in a request, in which case it MUST appear in a response. It MUST NOT appear in a response if it was not in the request.</li>
<li>Result code most significant bit now indicates permanent/temporary error</li>
<li>PCP Options are split into mandatory-to-process ("P" bit), and into Specification Required and Private Use.</li>
<li>Epoch discussion simplified.</li>
