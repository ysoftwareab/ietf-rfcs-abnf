1.  Introduction

   The scope of this MIB is targeted for network operators responsible 
   for managing the operations of network resources.  This document 
   defines an alarm reporting control (ARC) MIB module, which provides 
   a mechanism for a manager to suppress or defer the reporting of alarm
   conditions based on the resource ID and alarm condition type.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


4.  ARC MIB Overview

   There is a need to provide a mechanism for controlling the reporting
   of alarm conditions of resources in a network device.  For example, 
   (a) inhibiting the reporting of alarm conditions of a resource until 
   the resource is problem-free, (b) inhibiting the reporting of alarm 
   conditions of a resource for a specified time period, or 
   (c) inhibiting the reporting of alarm conditions of a resource 
   indefinitely until explicitly allowed by the managing system at a 
   later time. 

   The alarm reporting control (ARC) feature provides an automatic 
   in-service provisioning capability.  It allows sufficient time for 
   service setup, customer testing, and other maintenance activities in
   an "alarm-free" state. Once a resource is "problem-free", 
   alarm reporting can be automatically or manually turned on 
   (i.e., allowed).

   By putting a network resource in ARC mode, (i.e., in nalm, nalmTI,  
   nalmQI, or nalmQICD states, as described in the MIB), the technicians
   and managing systems will not be flooded with unnecessary work items 
   during operations activities such as service provisioning and 
   network setup/teardown.  This will reduce maintenance costs and 
   improve the operation and maintenance of these systems.
   Putting a network resource in ARC mode shall not affect the 
   availability of active alarm condition information for potential
   retrieval.

   ITU-T Recommendation M.3100 Amendment 3 [M.3100 Amd3] provides the 
   business requirements, analysis, and design of the Alarm Reporting 
   Control feature. 

   This document defines the SNMP objects to support a subset of 
   the ARC functions described in M.3100 Amd3.  In particular, it 
   defines a table that can be used to specify the ARC settings for 
   the resources in a system.

   The ARC MIB defined in this document provides a way to control the 
   reporting of alarm conditions.  A set of applicable alarm conditions
   is defined in ITU-T Recommendation M.3100 [M.3100] and is named 
   "probable causes".  These probable causes (alarm conditions) have
   been included in the IANAItuProbableCause TC in the Alarm MIB 
   [RFCzzzz].
-- RFC Ed.: replace zzzz with the actual RFC number of the Alarm MIB
--          document and remove this notice.
   The ARC MIB defines an IANAItuProbableCauseOrZero TC which
   can take any value of IANAItuProbableCause or 0.
   The ARC MIB further uses IANAItuProbableCauseOrZero to define the ARC
   settings for the managed resource in the network elements.
   Specification of objects for defining and storing alarms, including
   active and history alarms, standing and transient alarms, and alarm
   notifications are out of the scope of this document. 

4.1 Relationship between ARC mode and alarm reporting

   When the ARC mib is used in a managed system, the following rules
   apply:

   For alarm condition raised prior to entering ARC mode, reporting 
   of alarm raised and alarm cleared will be sent as usual. 

   For alarm condition raised after entering ARC mode and also 
   cleared before exiting ARC mode, no reporting of alarm raised will 
   be sent and no reporting of alarm cleared will be sent.

   For alarm condition raised after entering ARC mode and not cleared 
   when exiting ARC mode, the reporting of alarm raised will be 
   deferred until the moment of exiting ARC mode.  The reporting of 
   alarm cleared will be sent as usual (i.e., at the time of alarm 
   cleared).

   Further details of the ARC function can be found in M.3100 Amd3
   [M.3100 Amd3].

4.2 This document requires the allocation of a single object identifier
   beneath the mib-2 subtree for its module identity.

  DESCRIPTION
    "A table of Alarm Reporting Control (ARC) settings on the system.

     Alarm Reporting Control is a feature that provides an automatic 
     in-service provisioning capability.  Alarm reporting is turned 
     off on a per-resource basis for a selective set of potential  
     alarm conditions to allow sufficient time for customer testing 
     and other maintenance activities in an 'alarm free' state.
     Once a resource is ready for service, alarm reporting is 
     automatically or manually turned on. 

     Defined in M.3100 Amendment 3 [M.3100 Amd3], there are five 
     ARC states: alm, nalm, nalmQI, nalmQICD and nalmTI.
        
        alm:        Alarm reporting is turned on (i.e., is allowed).
        nalm:       Alarm reporting is turned off (i.e., not allowed).
        nalmQI:     nalm - Qualified Inhibit. Alarm reporting is 
                    turned off until the managed entity is qualified 
                    problem-free for a specified persistence interval.
        nalmQICD:   nalmQI - Count down.  This is a substate of nalmQI 
                    and performs the persistence timing countdown 
                    function when the managed entity is qualified 
                    problem-free.
        nalmTI:     nalm - Timed Inhibit.  Alarm reporting is turned 
                    off for a specified time interval. 

     alm may transition to nalm, nalmQI or nalmTI by management request.

     nalm may transition to alm, nalmQI or nalmTI by management request.

     nalmQI may transition to nalm or alm by management request.

     nalmQI may transition to alm automatically 
             if qualified problem-free (if nalmQICD is not supported) or
             if the CD timer expired (if nalmQICD is supported)

     nalmTI may transition to alm or nalm by management request.

     nalmTI may transition to alm automatically if the TI timer expired.

     Further details of ARC state transitions are defined in Figure 3 
     of M.3100 Amd3 [M.3100 Amd3]."

            }
  MAX-ACCESS  read-create
  STATUS  current
  DESCRIPTION
    "This object controls the alarm reporting of a resource.  A manager 
     can set the arcState to either nalm, nalmQI, or nalmTI.
        
      nalm:     Alarm reporting is turned off.
      nalmTI:   Alarm reporting is turned off for a time interval.
               (TI - Time Inhibit).
      nalmQI:   Alarm reporting is turned off for a specified
                  alarm type until the resource is qualified 
                  problem-free for an optional time interval.
              Problem-free means that the condition corresponding
              to the specified alarm type does not exist 
                  (i.e., cleared).
              (QI - Qualified Inhibit).
      nalmQICD: This is a substate of nalmQI and performs the 
              persistence timing count down function after the 
              resource is qualified problem-free. 
              (CD - Count Down).

     According to the requirements in M.3100 Amd3, a resource 
     supporting the ARC feature shall support the alm state and at 
     least one of the nalm, nalmTI, and nalmQI states. nalmQICD 
     is an optional substate of nalmQI.

     Note that the state alm (alarm reporting is allowed) is not listed
     in the enumeration of the value of this object.  However, this 
     state is implicitly supported by the mib.
     Once a resource enters the normal reporting mode (i.e., in the alm 
     state) for the specified alarm type, the corresponding
     row will be automatically deleted from the arc table.
     Also the manual setting of arcState to alm can be achieved through
     setting the RowStatus object to 'destroy'. 

     The nalamQICD state is a transitional state from nalmQI to alm.  It
     is optional depending on the resource type and the implementation 
     of the the resource.  If it is supported, before the state 
     transitions from nalmQI to alm, a count down period is activated 
     for a duration set by the object arcNalmCDTimeInterval.  When the 
     time is up, the arcState transitions to alm."

arcNalmTimeRemaining OBJECT-TYPE
  SYNTAX  Gauge32
  MAX-ACCESS  read-create
  STATUS  current
  DESCRIPTION
    "This variable indicates the time remaining in the nalmTI state
     or the nalmQICD state, in units of second.

     At the moment the resource enters the nalmTI state, this variable 
     will have the initial value equal to the value of
     arcNalmTITimeInterval and then starts decrementing as time goes by.

     Similarly at the moment the resource enters the nalmQICD state, 
     this variable will have the initial value equal to the value of 
     arcNalmCDTimeInterval and then starts decrementing as time goes by.

     This variable is read-create and thus will allow the manager to 
     write (extend or shorten), as needed, the remaining time when the
     resource is in the nalmTI or nalmQICD state.
     
     If this variable is supported and the resource is currently not in
     the nalmTI nor nalmQICD state, the value of this variable shall 
     equal to zero."

     Setting RowStatus to createAndGo or createAndWait implies creating 
     a new ARC setting for the specified resource and alarm type.
     Setting RowStatus to destroy implies removing the ARC setting and

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  It is
   possible for writes to these objects to have disruptive effects on
   network operation that range from omission of alarm notifications to 
   flooding of unwanted alarm notifications from the netowrk.  Users of 
   this MIB module must therefore be aware that support for SET 
   operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection can 
   have a negative effect on network operations.  The most sensitive 
   objects are the read-write and read-create objects
   arcTITimeInterval, arcCDTimeInterval, arcState,
   arcNalmTimeRemaining, arcRowStatus, and arcStorageType.

   The readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., the objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may also be considered 
   sensitive in some environments since, collectively, they provide 
   information about the setting which affects alarm notification 
   generation.  In such environments it is important to control even 
   GET and NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to encrypt the 
   values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network
   is allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
   objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
   (for authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to
   an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give
   access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
   legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
