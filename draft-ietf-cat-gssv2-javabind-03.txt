Abstract

   The Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
   offers application programmers uniform access to security services
   atop a variety of underlying cryptographic mechanisms. This document
   specifies the Java bindings for GSS-API which is described at a
   language independent conceptual level in RFC 2078 [GSSAPIv2].

   The GSS-API allows a caller application to authenticate a principal
   identity, to delegate rights to a peer, and to apply security
   services such as confidentiality and integrity on a per-message
   basis. Examples of security mechanisms defined for GSS-API are The
   Simple Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism [SPKM] and The Kerberos Version 5
   GSS-API Mechanism [KERBV5].

1.  Introduction


   This document specifies Java language bindings for the Generic
   Security Services Application Programming Interface (GSS-API) Version
   2. GSS-API Version 2 is described in a language independent format in
   RFC 2078 [GSSAPIv2]. The GSS-API allows a caller application to
   authenticate a principal identity, to delegate rights to a peer, and
   to apply security services such as confidentiality and integrity on a
   per-message basis.

   This document leverages the work performed by the WG in the area of
   RFC 2078 [GSSAPIv2] the C-bindings draft [GSSAPI-C].  Whenever
   appropriate, text has been used from the C-bindings document to
   explain generic concepts and provide direction to the implementors.

   The design goals of this API have been to satisfy all the
   functionality defined in RFC 2078 and to provide these services in an
   object oriented method.  The specification also aims to satisfy the
   needs of both types of Java application developers, those who would
   like access to a "system-wide" GSS-API implementation, as well as
   those who would want to provide their own "custom" implementation.

   A "system-wide" implementation is one that is available to all
   applications in the form of a library package.  It may be a standard
   package in the Java runtime environment (JRE) being used or it may be
   additionally installed and accessible to any application via the
   CLASSPATH.

   A "custom" implementation of the GSS-API, on the other hand, is one
   that would, in most cases, be bundled with the application during
   distribution.  It is expected that such an implementation would be
   meant to provide for some particular need of the application, such as
   support for some specific mechanism.

   The design of this API also aims to provide a flexible framework to
   add and manage GSS-API mechanisms. GSS-API leverages the JCA provider
   concept to support the plugability of mechanisms. Mechanisms can be
   added on a "system-wide" basis, where all users of the framework will
   have them available. The specification also allows for the addition
   of mechanisms per-instance the GSS-API.

   Lastly, this specification presents an API that will naturally fit
   within the operation environment of the Java platform.  Readers are
   assumed to be familiar with both the GSS-API and the Java platform.

2.  GSS-API Operational Paradigm


   The Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface
   [GSSAPIv2] defines a generic security API to calling applications.
   It allows a communicating application to authenticate the user
   associated with another application, to delegate rights to another
   application, and to apply security services such as confidentiality
   and integrity on a per-message basis.

        There are four stages to using GSS-API:

        1)   The application acquires a set of credentials with which it
             may prove its identity to other processes.  The
             application's credentials vouch for its global identity,
             which may or may not be related to any local username under
             which it may be running.

        2)   A pair of communicating applications establish a joint
             security context using their credentials.  The security
             context encapsulates shared state information, which is
             required in order that per-message security services may be
             provided.  Examples of state information that might be
             shared between applications as part of a security context
             are cryptographic keys, and message sequence numbers.  As
             part of the establishment of  a security context, the
             context initiator is authenticated to the responder, and
             may require that the responder is authenticated back to the
             initiator.  The initiator may optionally give the responder
             the right to initiate further security contexts, acting as
             an agent or delegate of the initiator.  This transfer of
             rights is termed "delegation", and is achieved by creating
             a set of credentials, similar to those used by the
             initiating application, but which may be used by the
             responder.

             A GSSContext object is used to establish and maintain the
             shared information that makes up the security context.
             Certain GSSContext methods will generate a token, which
             applications treat as cryptographically protected, opaque
             data.  The caller of such GSSContext method is responsible
             for transferring the token to the peer application,
             encapsulated if necessary in an application-to-application
             protocol.  On receipt of such a token, the peer application
             should pass it to a corresponding GSSContext method which
             will decode the token and extract the information, updating
             the security context state information accordingly.

                          GSS-API Java Bindings             October 1999


        3)   Per-message services are invoked on a GSSContext object to
             apply either:

                  integrity and data origin authentication, or

                  confidentiality, integrity and data origin
                  authentication

             to application data, which are treated by GSS-API as
             arbitrary octet-strings.  An application transmitting a
             message that it wishes to protect will call the appropriate
             GSSContext method (getMIC or wrap) to apply protection, and
             send the resulting token to the receiving application.  The
             receiver will pass the received token (and, in the case of
             data protected by getMIC, the accompanying message-data) to
             the corresponding decoding method of the GSSContext
             interface (verifyMIC or unwrap) to remove the protection
             and validate the data.

        4)   At the completion of a communications session (which may
             extend across several transport connections), each
             application uses a GSSContext method to invalidate the
             security context and release any system or cryptographic
             resources held.  Multiple contexts may also be used (either
             successively or simultaneously) within a single
             communications association, at the discretion of the
             applications.



3.  Additional Controls


   This section discusses the optional services that a context initiator
   may request of the GSS-API before the context establishment.  Each of
   these services is requested by calling the appropriate mutator method
   in the GSSContext object before the first call to init is performed.
   Only the context initiator can request context flags.

   The optional services defined are:

   Delegation
        The (usually temporary) transfer of rights from initiator to
        acceptor, enabling the acceptor to authenticate itself as an
        agent of the initiator.

   Mutual Authentication
        In addition to the initiator authenticating its identity to the

                          GSS-API Java Bindings             October 1999


        context acceptor, the context acceptor should also authenticate
        itself to the initiator.

   Replay Detection
        In addition to providing message integrity services, GSSContext
        per-message operations of getMIC and wrap should include message
        numbering information  to enable verifyMIC and unwrap to detect
        if a message has been duplicated.

   Out-of-Sequence Detection
        In addition to providing message integrity services, GSSContext
        per-message operations  (getMIC and wrap) should include message
        sequencing information to enable verifyMIC and unwrap to detect
        if a message has been received out of sequence.

   Anonymous Authentication
        The establishment of the security context should not reveal the
        initiator's identity to the context acceptor.

   Some mechanisms may not support all optional services, and some
   mechanisms may only support some services in conjunction with others.
   The GSSContext interface offers query methods to allow the
   verification by the calling application of which services will be
   available from the context when the establishment phase is complete.
   In general, if the security mechanism is capable of providing a
   requested service, it should do so even if additional services must
   be enabled in order to provide the requested service.  If the
   mechanism is incapable of providing a requested service, it should
   proceed without the service leaving the application to abort the
   context establishment process if it considers the requested service
   to be mandatory.

   Some mechanisms may specify that support for some services is
   optional, and that implementors of the mechanism need not provide it.
   This is most commonly true of the confidentiality service, often
   because of legal restrictions on the use of data-encryption, but may
   apply to any of the services.  Such mechanisms are required to send
   at least one token from acceptor to initiator during context
   establishment when the initiator indicates a desire to use such a
   service, so that the initiating GSS-API can correctly indicate
   whether the service is supported by the acceptor's GSS-API.


3.1.  Delegation

   The GSS-API allows delegation to be controlled by the initiating
   application via the requestCredDeleg method before the first call to
   init has been issued.  Some mechanisms do not support delegation, and



Expires: May 2000                                               [Page 9]


                          GSS-API Java Bindings             October 1999


   for such mechanisms attempts by an application to enable delegation
   are ignored.

   The acceptor of a security context, for which the initiator enabled
   delegation, can check if delegation was enabled by using the
   getCredDelegState method of the GSSContext interface.  In cases when
   it is, the delegated credential object can be obtained by calling the
   getDelegCred method.  The obtained GSSCredential object may then be
   used to initiate subsequent GSS-API security contexts as an agent or
   delegate of the initiator.  If the original initiator's identity is
   "A" and the delegate's identity is "B", then, depending on the
   underlying mechanism, the identity embodied by the delegated
   credential may be either "A" or "B acting for A".

   For many mechanisms that support delegation, a simple boolean does
   not provide enough control.  Examples of additional aspects of
   delegation control that a mechanism might provide to an application
   are duration of delegation, network addresses from which delegation
   is valid, and constraints on the tasks that may be performed by a
   delegate.  Such controls are presently outside the scope of the GSS-
   API.  GSS-API implementations supporting mechanisms offering
   additional controls should provide extension routines that allow
   these controls to be exercised (perhaps by modifying the initiator's
   GSS-API credential object prior to its use in establishing a
   context).  However, the simple delegation control provided by GSS-API
   should always be able to over-ride other mechanism-specific
   delegation controls.  If the application instructs the GSSContext
   object that delegation is not desired, then the implementation must
   not permit delegation to occur.  This is an exception to the general
   rule that a mechanism may enable services even if they are not
   requested - delegation may only be provided at the explicit request
   of the application.


3.2.  Mutual Authentication

   Usually, a context acceptor will require that a context initiator
   authenticate itself so that the acceptor may make an access-control
   decision prior to performing a service for the initiator.  In some
   cases, the initiator may also request that the acceptor authenticate
   itself.  GSS-API allows the initiating application to request this
   mutual authentication service by calling the requestMutualAuth method
   of the GSSContext interface with a "true" parameter before making the
   first call to init.  The initiating application is informed as to
   whether or not the context acceptor has authenticated itself.  Note
   that some mechanisms may not support mutual authentication, and other
   mechanisms may always perform mutual authentication, whether or not
   the initiating application requests it.  In particular, mutual



Expires: May 2000                                              [Page 10]


                          GSS-API Java Bindings             October 1999


   authentication may be required by some mechanisms in order to support
   replay or out-of-sequence message detection, and for such mechanisms
   a request for either of these services will automatically enable
   mutual authentication.


3.3.  Replay and Out-of-Sequence Detection

   The GSS-API may provide detection of mis-ordered messages once a
   security context has been established.  Protection may be applied to
   messages by either application, by calling either getMIC or wrap
   methods of the GSSContext interface, and verified by the peer
   application by calling verifyMIC or unwrap for the peer's GSSContext
   object.

   The getMIC method calculates a cryptographic checksum of an
   application message, and returns that checksum in a token.  The
   application should pass both the token and the message to the peer
   application, which presents them to the verifyMIC method of the
   peer's GSSContext object.

   The wrap method calculates a cryptographic checksum of an application
   message, and places both the checksum and the message inside a single
   token.  The application should pass the token to the peer
   application, which presents it to the unwrap method of the peer's
   GSSContext object to extract the message and verify the checksum.

   Either pair of routines may be capable of detecting out-of-sequence
   message delivery, or duplication of messages.  Details of such mis-
   ordered messages are indicated through supplementary query methods of
   the MessageProp object that is filled in by each of these routines.

   A mechanism need not maintain a list of all tokens that have been
   processed in order to support these status codes.  A typical
   mechanism might retain information about only the most recent "N"
   tokens processed, allowing it to distinguish duplicates and missing
   tokens within the most recent "N" messages; the receipt of a token
   older than the most recent "N" would result in the isOldToken method
   of the instance of MessageProp to return "true".


3.4.  Anonymous Authentication

   In certain situations, an application may wish to initiate the
   authentication process to authenticate a peer, without revealing its
   own identity.  As an example, consider an application providing
   access to a database containing medical information, and offering
   unrestricted access to the service.  A client of such a service might



Expires: May 2000                                              [Page 11]


                          GSS-API Java Bindings             October 1999


   wish to authenticate the service (in order to establish trust in any
   information retrieved from it), but might not wish the service to be
   able to obtain the client's identity (perhaps due to privacy concerns
   about the specific inquiries, or perhaps simply to avoid being placed
   on mailing-lists).

   In normal use of the GSS-API, the initiator's identity is made
   available to the acceptor as a result of the context establishment
   process.  However, context initiators may request that their identity
   not be revealed to the context acceptor.  Many mechanisms do not
   support anonymous authentication, and for such mechanisms the request
   will not be honored.  An authentication token will still be
   generated, but the application is always informed if a requested
   service is unavailable, and has the option to abort context
   establishment if anonymity is valued above the other security
   services that would require a context to be established.

   In addition to informing the application that a context is
   established anonymously (via the isAnonymous method of the GSSContext
   class), the getSrcName method of the acceptor's GSSContext object
   will, for such contexts, return a reserved internal-form name,
   defined by the implementation.

   The toString method for a GSSName object representing an anonymous
   entity will return a printable name.  The returned value will be
   syntactically distinguishable from any valid principal name supported
   by the implementation.  The associated name-type object identifier
   will be an oid representing the value of NT_ANONYMOUS.  This name-
   type oid will be defined as a public, static Oid object of the
   GSSName class.  The printable form of an anonymous name should be
   chosen such that it implies anonymity, since this name may appear in,
   for example, audit logs.  For example, the string "<anonymous>" might
   be a good choice, if no valid printable names supported by the
   implementation can begin with "<" and end with ">".

   When using the equal method of the GSSName interface, and one of the
   operands is a GSSName instance representing an anonymous entity, the
   method must return "false".


3.5.  Confidentiality

   If a GSSContext supports the confidentiality service, wrap method may
   be used to encrypt application messages.  Messages are selectively
   encrypted, under the control of the setPrivacy method of the
   MessageProp object used in the wrap method.

3.6.  Inter-process Context Transfer

   GSS-API V2 provides functionality which allows a security context to
   be transferred between processes on a single machine.  These are
   implemented using the export method of GSSContext and a byte array
   constructor of the same class.  The most common use for such a
   feature is a client-server design where the server is implemented as
   a single process that accepts incoming security contexts, which then
   launches child processes to deal with the data on these contexts.  In
   such a design, the child processes must have access to the security
   context object created within the parent so that they can use per-
   message protection services and delete the security context when the
   communication session ends.

   Since the security context data structure is expected to contain
   sequencing information, it is impractical in general to share a
   context between processes.  Thus GSSContext interface provides an
   export method that the process, which currently owns the context, can
   call to declare that it has no intention to use the context
   subsequently, and to create an inter-process token containing
   information needed by the adopting process to successfully re-create
   the context.  After successful completion of export, the original
   security context is made inaccessible to the calling process by GSS-
   API and any further usage of this object will result in failures.
   The originating process transfers the inter-process token to the
   adopting process, which creates a new GSSContext object using the
   byte array constructor.  The properties of the context are equivalent
   to that of the original context.

   The inter-process token may contain sensitive data from the original
   security context (including cryptographic keys).  Applications using
   inter-process tokens to transfer security contexts must take
   appropriate steps to protect these tokens in transit.

   Implementations are not required to support the inter-process
   transfer of security contexts.  Calling the isTransferable method of
   the GSSContext interface will indicate if the context object is
   transferable.


3.7.  The Use of Incomplete Contexts

   Some mechanisms may allow the per-message services to be used before
   the context establishment process is complete.  For example, a
   mechanism may include sufficient information in its initial context-
   level tokens for the context acceptor to immediately decode messages
   protected with wrap or getMIC.  For such a mechanism, the initiating
   application need not wait until subsequent context-level tokens have

   been sent and received before invoking the per-message protection
   services.

   An application can invoke the isProtReady method of the GSSContext
   class to determine if the per-message services are available in
   advance of complete context establishment.  Applications wishing to
   use per-message protection services on partially-established contexts
   should query this method before attempting to invoke wrap or getMIC.



4.  Calling Conventions


   Java provides the implementors with not just a syntax for the
   language, but also an operational environment.  For example, memory
   is automatically managed and does not require application
   intervention.  These language features have allowed for a simpler API
   and have led to the elimination of certain GSS-API functions.

   Moreover, the Java Cryptographic Architecture (JCA) defines a
   provider model which allows an implementation independent access to
   its security services. Using this model, applications can seamlessly
   switch between different implementations and dynamically add new
   services. The GSS-API specification leverages these concepts by the
   usage of providers for the mechanism implementations.


4.1.  Package Name

   The classes and interfaces defined in this document reside in the
   package called "org.ietf.jgss".  Applications that wish to make use
   of this API should import this package name as shows in section 7.


4.2.  Provider Framework

   The Java security API's use a provider architecture that allows
   applications to be implementation independent and security API
   implementations to be modular and extensible.  The
   java.security.Provider class is an abstract class that a vendor
   extends.  This class maps various properties that represent different
   security services that are available to the names of the actual
   vendor classes that implement those services.  When requesting a
   service, an application simply specifies the desired provider and the
   API delegates the request to service classes available from that
   provider.




Expires: May 2000                                              [Page 14]


                          GSS-API Java Bindings             October 1999


   Using the Java security provider model insulates applications from
   implementation details of the services they wish to use.
   Applications can switch between providers easily and new providers
   can be added as needed, even at runtime.

   The GSS-API may use providers to find components for specific
   underlying security mechanisms.  For instance, a particular provider
   might contain components that will allow the GSS-API to support the
   Kerberos v5 mechanism and another might contain components to support
   the SPKM mechanism.  By delegating mechanism specific functionality
   to the components obtained from providers the GSS-API can be extended
   to support an arbitrary list of mechanism.

   How the GSS-API locates and queries these providers is beyond the
   scope of this document and is being deferred to a Service Provider
   Interface (SPI) specification.  The availability of such a SPI
   specification is not mandatory for the adoption of this API
   specification nor is it mandatory to use providers in the
   implementation of a GSS-API framework. However, by using the provider
   framework together with an SPI specification one can create an
   extensible and implementation independent GSS-API framework.


4.3.  Integer types

   All numeric values are declared as "int" primitive Java type.  The
   Java specification guarantees that this will be a 32 bit two's
   complement signed number.

   Throughout this API, the "boolean" primitive Java type is used
   wherever a boolean value is required or returned.


4.4.  Opaque Data types

   Java byte arrays are used to represent opaque data types which are
   consumed and produced by the GSS-API in the forms of tokens.  Java
   arrays contain a length field which enables the users to easily
   determine their size.  The language has automatic garbage collection
   which alleviates the need by developers to release memory and
   simplifies buffer ownership issues.


4.5.  Strings

   The String object will be used to represent all textual data.  The
   Java String object, transparently treats all characters as two-byte
   Unicode characters which allows support for many locals.  All

   routines returning or accepting textual data will use the String
   object.


4.6.  Object Identifiers

   An Oid object will be used to represent Universal Object Identifiers
   (Oids).  Oids are ISO-defined, hierarchically globally-interpretable
   identifiers used within the GSS-API framework to identify security
   mechanisms and name formats.  The Oid object can be created from a
   string representation of its dot notation (e.g. "1.3.6.1.5.6.2") as
   well as from its ASN.1 DER encoding.  Methods are also provided to
   test equality and provide the DER representation for the object.

   An important feature of the Oid class is that its instances are
   immutable - i.e.  there are no methods defined that allow one to
   change the contents of an Oid.  This property allows one to treat
   these objects as "statics" without the need to perform copies.

   Certain routines allow the usage of a default oid.  A "null" value
   can be used in those cases.


4.7.  Object Identifier Sets

   The Java bindings represents object identifiers sets as arrays of Oid
   objects.  All Java arrays contain a length field which allows for
   easy manipulation and reference.

   In order to support the full functionality of RFC 2078, the Oid class
   includes a method which checks for existence of an Oid object within
   a specified array.  This is equivalent in functionality to
   gss_test_oid_set_member.  The use of Java arrays and Java's automatic
   garbage collection has eliminated the need for the following
   routines: gss_create_empty_oid_set, gss_release_oid_set, and
   gss_add_oid_set_member.  Java GSS-API implementations will not
   contain them.  Java's automatic garbage collection and the immutable
   property of the Oid object eliminates the complicated memory
   management issues of the C counterpart.

   When ever a default value for an Object Identifier Set is required, a
   "null" value can be used.  Please consult the detailed method
   description for details.


4.8.  Credentials

   GSS-API credentials are represented by the GSSCredential interface.

                          GSS-API Java Bindings             October 1999


   The interface contains several constructs to allow for the creation
   of most common credential objects for the initiator and the acceptor.
   Comparisons are performed using the interface's "equals" method.  The
   following general description of GSS-API credentials is included from
   the C-bindings specification:

   GSS-API credentials can contain mechanism-specific principal
   authentication data for multiple mechanisms.  A GSS-API credential is
   composed of a set of credential-elements, each of which is applicable
   to a single mechanism.  A credential may contain at most one
   credential-element for each supported mechanism.  A credential-
   element identifies the data needed by a single mechanism to
   authenticate a single principal, and conceptually contains two
   credential-references that describe the actual mechanism-specific
   authentication data, one to be used by GSS-API for initiating
   contexts,  and one to be used for accepting contexts.  For mechanisms
   that do not distinguish between acceptor and initiator credentials,
   both references would point to the same underlying mechanism-specific
   authentication data.

   Credentials describe a set of mechanism-specific principals, and give
   their holder the ability to act as any of those principals.  All
   principal identities asserted by a single GSS-API credential should
   belong to the same entity, although enforcement of this property is
   an implementation-specific matter.  A single GSSCredential object
   represents all the credential elements that have been acquired.

   The creation's of an GSSContext object allows the value of "null" to
   be specified as the GSSCredential input parameter.  This will
   indicate a desire by the application to act as a default principal.
   While individual GSS-API implementations are free to determine such
   default behavior as appropriate to the mechanism, the following
   default behavior by these routines is recommended for portability:

        For the initiator side of the context:

        1)   If there is only a single principal capable of initiating
             security contexts for the chosen mechanism that the
             application is authorized to act on behalf of, then that
             principal shall be used, otherwise

        2)   If the platform maintains a concept of a default network-
             identity for the chosen mechanism, and if the application
             is authorized to act on behalf of that identity for the
             purpose of initiating security contexts, then the principal
             corresponding to that identity shall be used, otherwise

        3)   If the platform maintains a concept of a default local

             identity, and provides a means to map local identities into
             network-identities for the chosen mechanism, and if the
             application is authorized to act on behalf of the network-
             identity image of the default local identity for the
             purpose of initiating security contexts using the chosen
             mechanism, then the principal corresponding to that
             identity shall be used, otherwise

        4)   A user-configurable default identity should be used.


        and for the acceptor side of the context


        1)   If there is only a single authorized principal identity
             capable of accepting security contexts for the chosen
             mechanism, then that principal shall be used, otherwise

        2)   If the mechanism can determine the identity of the target
             principal by examining the context-establishment token
             processed during the accept method, and if the accepting
             application is authorized to act as that principal for the
             purpose of accepting security contexts using the chosen
             mechanism, then that principal identity shall be used,
             otherwise

        3)   If the mechanism supports context acceptance by any
             principal, and if mutual authentication was not requested,
             any principal that the application is authorized to accept
             security contexts under using the chosen mechanism may be
             used, otherwise

        4)   A user-configurable default identity shall be used.

   The purpose of the above rules is to allow security contexts to be
   established by both initiator and acceptor using the default behavior
   whenever possible.  Applications requesting default behavior are
   likely to be more portable across mechanisms and implementations than
   ones that instantiate an GSSCredential object representing a specific
   identity.


4.9.  Contexts

   The GSSContext interface is used to represent one end of a GSS-API
   security context, storing state information appropriate to that end
   of the peer communication, including cryptographic state information.

   The instantiation of the context object is done differently by the
   initiator and the acceptor.  After the context has been instantiated,
   the initiator may choose to set various context options which will
   determine the characteristics of the desired security context.  When
   all the application desired characteristics have been set, the
   initiator will call the initSecContext method which will produce a
   token for consumption by the peer's acceptSecContext method.  It is
   the responsibility of the application to deliver the authentication
   token(s) between the peer applications for processing.  Upon
   completion of the context establishment phase, context attributes can
   be retrieved, by both the initiator and acceptor, using the accessor
   methods.  These will reflect the actual attributes of the established
   context.  At this point the context can be used by the application to
   apply cryptographic services to its data.


4.10.  Authentication tokens

   A token is a caller-opaque type that GSS-API uses to maintain
   synchronization between each end of the GSS-API security context.
   The token is a cryptographically protected octet-string, generated by
   the underlying mechanism at one end of a GSS-API security context for
   use by the peer mechanism at the other end.  Encapsulation (if
   required) within the application protocol and transfer of the token
   are the responsibility of the peer applications.

   Java GSS-API uses byte arrays to represent authentication tokens.
   Overloaded methods exist which allow the caller to supply input and
   output streams which will be used for the reading and writing of the
   token data.


4.11.  Interprocess tokens

   Certain GSS-API routines are intended to transfer data between
   processes in multi-process programs.  These routines use a caller-
   opaque octet-string, generated by the GSS-API in one process for use
   by the GSS-API in another process.  The calling application is
   responsible for transferring such tokens between processes.  Note
   that, while GSS-API implementors are encouraged to avoid placing
   sensitive information within interprocess tokens, or to
   cryptographically protect them, many implementations will be unable
   to avoid placing key material or other sensitive data within them.
   It is the application's responsibility to ensure that interprocess
   tokens are protected in transit, and transferred only to processes
   that are trustworthy.  An interprocess token is represented using a
   byte array emitted from the export method of the GSSContext
   interface.  The receiver of the interprocess token would initialize

   an GSSContext object with this token to create a new context.  Once a
   context has been exported, the GSSContext object is invalidated and
   is no longer available.


4.12.  Error Reporting

   RFC 2078 defined the usage of major and minor status values for
   signaling of GSS-API errors.  The major code, also called GSS status
   code, is used to signal errors at the GSS-API level independent of
   the underlying mechanism(s).  The minor status value or Mechanism
   status code, is a mechanism defined error value indicating a
   mechanism specific error code.

   Java GSS-API uses exceptions implemented by the GSSException class to
   signal both minor and major error values.  Both, mechanism specific
   errors and GSS-API level errors are signaled through instances of
   this class.  The usage of exceptions replaces the need for major and
   minor codes to be used within the API calls.  GSSException class also
   contains methods to obtain textual representations for both the major
   and minor values, which is equivalent to the functionality of
   gss_display_status.


4.12.1.  GSS status codes

   GSS status codes indicate errors that are independent of the
   underlying mechanism(s) used to provide the security service.  The
   errors that can be indicated via a GSS status code are generic API
   routine errors (errors that are defined in the GSS-API
   specification).  These bindings take advantage of the Java exceptions
   mechanism, thus eliminating the need for calling errors.

   A GSS status code indicates a single fatal generic API error from the
   routine that has thrown the GSSException.  Using exceptions announces
   that a fatal error has occurred during the execution of the method.
   The GSS-API operational model also allows for the signaling of
   supplementary status information from the per-message calls.  These
   need to be handled as return values since using exceptions is not
   appropriate for informatory or warning-like information.  The methods
   that are capable of producing supplementary information are the two
   per-message methods GSSContext.verifyMIC() and GSSContext.unwrap().
   These methods fill the supplementary status codes in the MessageProp
   object that was passed in.

   GSSException object, along with providing the functionality for
   setting of the various error codes and translating them into textual
   representation, also contains the definitions of all the numeric

   The GSS major status code of FAILURE is used to indicate that the
   underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific GSS
   status code is defined.  The mechanism-specific status code can
   provide more details about the error.


4.12.2.  Mechanism-specific status codes

   Mechanism-specific status codes are communicated in two ways, they
   are part of any GSSException thrown from the mechanism specific layer
   to signal a fatal error, or they are part of the MessageProp object
   that the per-message calls use to signal non-fatal errors.

   A default value of 0 in either the GSSException object or the
   MessageProp object will be used to represent the absence of any
   mechanism specific status code.


4.12.3.  Supplementary status codes

   Supplementary status codes are confined to the per-message methods of
   the GSSContext interface.  Because of the informative nature of these
   errors it is not appropriate to use exceptions to signal them.
   Instead, the per-message operations of the GSSContext interface
   return these values in a MessageProp object.

   The MessageProp class defines query methods which return boolean
   values indicating the following supplementary states:

                           not received.


   "true" return value for any of the above methods indicates that the
   token exhibited the specified property.  The application must
   determine the appropriate course of action for these supplementary
   values.  They are not treated as errors by the GSS-API.


4.13.  Names

   A name is used to identify a person or entity.  GSS-API authenticates
   the relationship between a name and the entity claiming the name.

   Since different authentication mechanisms may employ different
   namespaces for identifying their principals, GSS-API's naming support
   is necessarily complex in multi-mechanism environments (or even in
   some single-mechanism environments where the underlying mechanism
   supports multiple namespaces).

   Two distinct conceptual representations are defined for names:


   1)   A GSS-API form represented by implementations of the GSSName
        interface: A single GSSName object may contain multiple names
        from different namespaces, but all names should refer to the
        same entity.  An example of such an internal name would be the
        name returned from a call to the getName method of the
        GSSCredential interface, when applied to a credential containing
        credential elements for multiple authentication mechanisms
        employing different namespaces.  This GSSName object will
        contain a distinct name for the entity for each authentication
        mechanism.




Expires: May 2000                                              [Page 23]


                          GSS-API Java Bindings             October 1999


        For GSS-API implementations supporting multiple namespaces,
        GSSName implementations must contain sufficient information to
        determine the namespace to which each primitive name belongs.

   2)   Mechanism-specific contiguous byte array and string forms:
        Different GSSName initialization methods are provided to handle
        both byte array and string formats and to accommodate various
        calling applications and name types.  These formats are capable
        of containing only a single name (from a single namespace).
        Contiguous string names are always accompanied by an object
        identifier specifying the namespace to which the name belongs,
        and their format is dependent on the authentication mechanism
        that employs that name.  The string name forms are assumed to be
        printable, and may therefore be used by GSS-API applications for
        communication with their users.  The byte array name formats are
        assumed to be in non-printable formats (e.g.  the byte array
        returned from the export method of the GSSName interface).

   An GSSName object can be converted to a contiguous representation by
   using the toString method.  This will guarantee that the name will be
   converted to a printable format.  Different initialization methods in
   the GSSName interface are defined allowing support for multiple
   syntaxes for each supported namespace, and allowing users the freedom
   to choose a preferred name representation.  The toString method
   should use an implementation-chosen printable syntax for each
   supported name-type.  To obtain the printable name type,
   getStringNameType method can be used.

   There is no guarantee that calling the toString method on the GSSName
   interface will produce the same string form as the original imported
   string name.  Furthermore, it is possible that the name was not even
   constructed from a string representation.  The same applies to name-
   space identifiers which may not necessarily survive unchanged after a
   journey through the internal name-form.  An example of this might be
   a mechanism that authenticates X.500 names, but provides an
   algorithmic mapping of Internet DNS names into X.500.  That
   mechanism's implementation of GSSName might, when presented with a
   DNS name, generate an internal name that contained both the original
   DNS name and the equivalent X.500 name.  Alternatively, it might only
   store the X.500 name.  In the latter case, the toString method of
   GSSName would most likely generate a printable X.500 name, rather
   than the original DNS name.

   The context acceptor can obtain an GSSName object representing the
   entity performing the context initiation (through the usage of
   getSrcName method).  Since this name has been authenticated by a
   single mechanism, it contains only a single name (even if the
   internal name presented by the context initiator to the GSSContext

   object had multiple components).  Such names are termed internal
   mechanism names, or "MN"s and the names emitted by GSSContext
   interface in the getSrcName and getTargName are always of this type.
   Since some applications may require MNs without wanting to incur the
   overhead of an authentication operation, creation methods are
   provided that take not only the name buffer and name type, but also
   the mechanism oid for which this name should be created.  When
   dealing with an existing GSSName object, the canonicalize method may
   be invoked to convert a general internal name into an MN.

   GSSName objects can be compared using their equal method, which
   returns "true" if the two names being compared refer to the same
   entity.  This is the preferred way to perform name comparisons
   instead of using the printable names that a given GSS-API
   implementation may support.  Since GSS-API assumes that all primitive
   names contained within a given internal name refer to the same
   entity, equal can return "true" if the two names have at least one
   primitive name in common.  If the implementation embodies knowledge
   of equivalence relationships between names taken from different
   namespaces, this knowledge may also allow successful comparisons of
   internal names containing no overlapping primitive elements.

   When used in large access control lists, the overhead of creating an
   GSSName object on each name and invoking the equal method on each
   name from the ACL may be prohibitive.  As an alternative way of
   supporting this case, GSS-API defines a special form of the
   contiguous byte array name which may be compared directly (byte by
   byte).  Contiguous names suitable for comparison are generated by the
   export method.  Exported names may be re-imported by using the byte
   array constructor and specifying the NT_EXPORT_NAME as the name type
   object identifier.  The resulting GSSName name will also be a MN.
   The GSSName interface defines public static Oid objects representing
   the standard name types.  Structurally, an exported name object
   consists of a header containing an OID identifying the mechanism that
   authenticated the name, and a trailer containing the name itself,
   where the syntax of the trailer is defined by the individual
   mechanism specification.  Detailed description of the format is
   specified in the language-independent GSS-API specification
   [GSSAPIv2].

   Note that the results obtained by using the equals method will in
   general be different from those obtained by invoking canonicalize and
   export, and then comparing the byte array output.  The first series
   of operation determines whether two (unauthenticated) names identify
   the same principal; the second whether a particular mechanism would
   authenticate them as the same principal.  These two operations will
   in general give the same results only for MNs.

   It is important to note that the above are guidelines as how GSSName
   implementations should behave, and are not intended to be specific
   requirements of how names objects must be implemented.  The mechanism
   designers are free to decide on the details of their implementations
   of the GSSName interface as long as the behavior satisfies the above
   guidelines.


4.14.  Channel Bindings

   GSS-API supports the use of user-specified tags to identify a given
   context to the peer application.  These tags are intended to be used
   to identify the particular communications channel that carries the
   context.  Channel bindings are communicated to the GSS-API using the
   ChannelBinding object.  The application may use byte arrays to
   specify the application data to be used in the channel binding as
   well as using instances of the InetAddress.  The InetAddress for the
   initiator and/or acceptor can be used within an instance of a
   ChannelBinding.  ChannelBinding can be set for the GSSContext object
   using the setChannelBinding method before the first call to init or
   accept has been performed.  Unless the setChannelBinding method has
   been used to set the ChannelBinding for an GSSContext object, "null"
   ChannelBinding will be assumed.  InetAddress is currently the only
   address type defined within the Java platform and as such, it is the
   only one supported within the ChannelBinding class.  Applications
   that use other types of addresses can include them as part of the
   application specific data.

   Conceptually, the GSS-API concatenates the initiator and acceptor
   address information, and the application supplied byte array to form
   an octet string.  The mechanism calculates a MIC over this octet
   string and binds the MIC to the context establishment token emitted
   by init method of the GSSContext interface.  The same bindings are
   set by the context acceptor for its GSSContext object and during
   processing of the accept method a MIC is calculated in the same way.
   The calculated MIC is compared with that found in the token, and if
   the MICs differ, accept will throw a GSSException with the  major
   code set to BAD_BINDINGS, and the context will not be established.
   Some mechanisms may include the actual channel binding data in the
   token (rather than just a MIC); applications should therefore not use
   confidential data as channel-binding components.

   Individual mechanisms may impose additional constraints on addresses
   that may appear in channel bindings.  For example, a mechanism may
   verify that the initiator address field of the channel binding
   contains the correct network address of the host system.  Portable
   applications should therefore ensure that they either provide correct
   information for the address fields, or omit setting of the addressing

   information.


4.15.  Stream Objects

   The context object provides overloaded methods which use input and
   output streams as the means to convey authentication and per-message
   GSS-API tokens.  It is important to note that the streams are
   expected to contain the usual GSS-API tokens which would otherwise be
   handled through the usage of byte arrays.  The tokens are expected to
   have a definite start and an end.  The callers are responsible for
   ensuring that the supplied streams will not block, or expect to block
   until a full token is processed by the GSS-API method.  Only a single
   GSS-API token will be processed per invocation of the stream based
   method.

   The usage of streams allows the callers to have control and
   management of the supplied buffers.  Because streams are non-
   primitive objects, the callers can make the streams as complicated or
   as simple as desired simply by using the streams defined in the
   java.io package or creating their own through the use of inheritance.
   This will allow for the application's greatest flexibility.


4.16.  Optional Parameters

   Whenever the application wishes to omit an optional parameter the
   "null" value shall be used.  The detailed method descriptions
   indicate which parameters are optional.  Methods overloading has also
   been used as a technique to indicate default parameters.



5.  Introduction to GSS-API Classes and Interfaces


   This section presents a brief description of the classes and
   interfaces that constitute the GSS-API.  The implementations of these
   are obtained from the CLASSPATH defined by the application.  If Java
   GSS becomes part of the standard Java API's then these classes will
   be available by default on all systems as part of the JRE's system
   classes.

   This section also shows the corresponding RFC 2078 functionality
   implemented by each of the classes.  Detailed description of these
   classes and their methods is presented in section 6.

5.1.  GSSManager class

   This class serves as a factory to instantiate implementations of the
   GSS-API interfaces and also provides methods to make queries about
   underlying security mechanisms.  How this class locates and
   communicates with components from the underlying security mechanisms
   is outside the scope of this document, but may be specified in
   whatever SPI the GSSManager implementation follows.

   Applications that desire to provide their own implementation of the
   GSSManager class can simply extend the standard GSSManager class and
   instantiate the new subclass.  However, it is recommended that rather
   than replacing the implementation, they enable the existing
   implementation to support their needs by providing the necessary
   components via the SPI that it follows.

   This class contains equivalents of the following RFC 2078 routines:


        RFC 2078 Routine                  Function             Section

   GSS-API names are represented in the Java bindings through the

   GSSName interface.  Different name formats and their definitions are
   identified with universal Object Identifiers (oids).  The format of
   the names can be derived based on the unique oid of each name type.
   The following GSS-API routines are provided by the GSSName interface:


     RFC 2078 Routine                 Function               Section(s)


   gss_display_name        Covert internal name             6.2.7
                           representation to text format.

   gss_compare_name        Compare two internal names.      6.2.3, 6.2.4

   gss_release_name        Release resources associated     N/A
                           with the internal name.

   gss_canonicalize_name   Convert an internal name to a    6.1.11,
                           mechanism name.

   gss_export_name         Convert a mechanism name to      6.2.6
                           export format.

   gss_duplicate_name      Create a copy of the internal    N/A
                           name.


   The gss_release_name call is not provided as Java does its own
   garbage collection. The gss_duplicate_name call is also redundant;
   the GSSName interface has no mutator methods that can change the
   state of the object so it is safe for sharing.


5.3.  GSSCredential interface

   The GSSCredential interface is responsible for the encapsulation of
   GSS-API credentials.  Credentials identify a single entity and
   provide the necessary cryptographic information to enable the
   creation of a context on behalf of that entity.  A single credential
   may contain multiple mechanism specific credentials, each referred to
   as a credential element.  The GSSCredential interface provides the
   functionality of the following GSS-API routines:


       RFC 2078 Routine               Function            Section(s)

   gss_add_cred               Constructs credentials        6.3.12

                              information about
                              a credential.

                              after use.



5.4.  GSSContext interface

   This interface encapsulates the functionality of context-level calls
   required for security context establishment and management between
   peers as well as the per-message services offered to applications.  A
   context is established between a pair of peers and allows the usage
   of security services on a per-message basis on application data.  It
   is created over a single security mechanism.  The GSSContext
   interface provides the functionality of the following GSS-API
   routines:


      RFC 2078 Routine                 Function              Section(s)

   gss_init_sec_context     Initiate the creation of a       6.4.3,

                            decrypting it.


   The functionality offered by the gss_process_context_token routine
   has not been included in the Java bindings specification.  The
   corresponding functionality of gss_delete_sec_context has also been
   modified to not return any peer tokens.  This has been proposed in
   accordance to the recommendations stated in the RFC 2078 update
   draft.  GSSContext does offer the functionality of destroying the
   locally-stored context information.


5.5.  MessageProp class

   This helper class is used in the per-message operations on the
   context.  An instance of this class is created by the application and
   then passed into the per-message calls.  In some cases, the
   application conveys information to the GSS-API implementation through
   this object and in other cases the GSS-API returns information to the
   application by setting it in this object.  See the description of the
   per-message operations wrap, unwrap, getMIC, and verifyMIC in the
   GSSContext interfaces for details.


5.6.  GSSException class

   Exceptions are used in the Java bindings to signal fatal errors to
   the calling applications.  This replaces the major and minor codes
   used in the C-bindings specification as a method of signaling
   failures.  The GSSException class handles both minor and major codes,
   as well as their translation into textual representation.  All GSS-
   API methods are declared as throwing this exception.

5.7.  Oid class

   This utility class is used to represent Universal Object Identifiers
   and their associated operations.  GSS-API uses object identifiers to
   distinguish between security mechanisms and name types.  This class,
   aside from being used whenever an object identifier is needed,
   implements the following GSS-API functionality:


      RFC 2078 Routine                  Function              Section

   gss_test_oid_set_member   Determine if the specified oid   6.7.5
                             is part of a set of oids.


5.8.  ChannelBinding class

   An instance of this class is used to specify channel binding
   information to the GSSContext object before the start of a security
   context establishment.  The application may use a byte array to
   specify application data to be used in the channel binding as well as
   use instances of the InetAddress.  InetAddress is currently the only
   address type defined within the Java platform and as such, it is the
   only one supported within the ChannelBinding class. Applications that
   use other types of addresses can include them as part of the
   application data.



6.  Detailed GSS-API Class Description


   This section lists a detailed description of all the public methods
   that each of the GSS-API classes and interfaces must provide.


6.1.  public class GSSManager


   The GSSManager is a concrete class that serves as a factory for three
   GSS interfaces: GSSName, GSSCredential, and GSSContext. It also

   provides methods for applications to determine what mechanisms are
   available on the system and what nametypes these mechanisms support.

   The GSSManager class may be internally implemented as a modular
   provider based layer that follows some service provider specification
   to lookup underlying mechanism components. It provides the
   application with a method to set a preferred provider for any given
   mechanism.


6.1.1.  Example Code


   GSSManager mgr = new GSSManager();

   // What mechs are available to us?
   Oid[] supportedMechs = mgr.getMechs();

   // Set a preference for the provider to be used when support is need
   // for the mechanisms "1.2.840.113554.1.2.2" and "1.3.6.1.5.5.2".
   // Assume this provider (called "Sun") has already been installed on
   // the system.

   Oid krb = new Oid("1.2.840.113554.1.2.2");
   Oid spnego = new Oid("1.3.6.1.5.5.2");

   mgr.setProvider(krb, "Sun");

   Oid spkm1 = new Oid("1.3.6.1.5.5.1.1");

   Provider prov = (Provider) (new com.foo.security.Provider());

   mgr.setProvider(spkm1, prov);

6.1.3.  setProvider

   public void setProvider(Oid mech, String provName)
           throws GSSException, java.security.NoSuchProviderException

   Sets the provider for the GSS-API to use internally when it needs
   components to support the indicated mechanism.

   If the GSSManager implementation does not support an SPI with a
   pluggable provider architecture it should throw a GSSException with
   the status code GSSException.UNAVAILABLE to indicate that the
   operation is unavailable. If the requested provider does not support
   the indicated mech then it should throw a GSSException with the
   status code GSSException.BAD_MECH.

   This call assumes that the provider defined by the string provName is
   already installed on the system either statically or dynamically
   using the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) specification. If it
   does not find the provider it should throw a NoSuchProviderException.

   Parameters:

        mech      The mechanism for which the provider is being set

        provName  The name of the provider that should be used whenever
                  support is needed for mech. A value of null will
                  remove any previous preference set by the application.



6.1.4.  setProvider

   public void setProvider(Oid mech, java.security.Provider p)
           throws GSSException

   Sets the provider for the GSS-API to use internally when it needs
   components to support the indicated mechanism.

   If the GSSManager implementation does not support an SPI with a
   pluggable provider architecture it should throw a GSSException with
   the status code GSSException.UNAVAILABLE to indicate that the
   operation is unavailable. If the requested provider does not support
   the indicated mech then it should throw a GSSException with the
   status code GSSException.BAD_MECH.

   This provider need not be installed globally on the system at all.
   The application instantiates the provider and passes it to the
   instance of GSSManager through this method.

   Parameters:

        p         The provider instance to be used to implement the
                  services for the specified mechanism. A value of null
                  will remove any previous preference set by the
                  application.




6.1.5.  getProvider

   public  Provider getProvider(Oid mech)

   Returns the preferred Provider instance that the GSS-API would use
   when trying to instantiate elements for the indicated mechanism.


6.1.6.  getMechs

   mechanisms are found to support the specified name type.

   Parameters:

6.1.9.  createName

   public GSSName createName(String nameStr, Oid nameSpace)

   Factory method to convert a contiguous string name from the specified
   namespace to an GSSName object.  In general, the GSSName object
   created will not be an MN; two examples that are exceptions to this
   are when the namespace type parameter indicates NT_EXPORT_NAME or
   when the GSS-API implementation is not multi-mechanism.

   Parameters:

        nameStr   The string representing a printable form of the name
                  to create.

        nameType  The Oid specifying the namespace of the printable name

        nameType  The Oid specifying the namespace of the name supplied
                  in the byte array.  Note that nameType serves to
                  describe and qualify the interpretation of the input
                  name byte array, it does not necessarily imply a type
                  for the output GSSName implementation. "null" value
                  can be used to specify that a mechanism specific
                  default syntax should be assumed by each mechanism
                  that examines the byte array.



6.1.11.  createName

   public GSSName createName(String nameStr, Oid nameType,
                   Oid mechType) throws GSSException

   Factory method to convert a contiguous string name from the specified
   namespace to an GSSName object that is a mechanism name (MN).  In
   other words, this method is a utility that does the equivalent of two
   steps: the createName described in 6.1.7 and then also the
   GSSName.canonicalize() described in 6.2.5.

   Parameters:

        nameStr   The string representing a printable form of the name
                  to create.

        nameType  The Oid specifying the namespace of the printable name
                  supplied.  Note that nameType serves to describe and
                  qualify the interpretation of the input nameStr, it
                  does not necessarily imply a type for the output
                  GSSName implementation. "null" value can be used to
                  specify that a mechanism specific default printable
                  syntax should be assumed when the mechanism examines
                  nameStr.

        mechType  Oid specifying the mechanism for which this name
                  should be created.

6.2.  public interface GSSName

   This interface encapsulates a single GSS-API principal entity.
   Different name formats and their definitions are identified with
   universal Object Identifiers (Oids).  The format of the names can be
   derived based on the unique oid of its namespace type.

   Included below are code examples utilizing the GSSName interface.
   The code below creates a GSSName, converts it to a mechanism name
   (MN), performs a comparison, obtains a printable representation of
   the name, exports it and then re-imports to obtain a new GSSName.


   GSSManager mgr = new GSSManager();

6.2.2.  Static Constants

   public static final Oid NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE

   Oid indicating a host-based service name form.  It is used to
   represent services associated with host computers.  This name form is
   constructed using two elements, "service" and "hostname", as follows:

        service@hostname

   Values for the "service" element are registered with the IANA. It

6.2.3.  equals

   public boolean equals(GSSName another) throws GSSException

   Compares two GSSName objects to determine whether they refer to the
   same entity.  This method may throw a GSSException when the names
   cannot be compared.  If either of the names represents an anonymous
   entity, the method will return "false".

   Parameters:

        another   GSSName object to compare with.

   public boolean equals(Object another)

   A variation of the equals method described in 6.2.3 that is provided
   to override the Object.equals() method that the implementing class
   will inherit.  The behaviour is exactly the same as that in 6.2.3
   except that no GSSException is thrown; instead, false will be
   returned in the situation where an error occurs.

   Parameters:

        another   GSSName object to compare with.

6.2.5.  canonicalize

   public GSSName canonicalize(Oid mechOid) throws GSSException

   Creates a mechanism name (MN) from an arbitrary internal name.  This
   is equivalent to using the factory methods described in 6.1.9 or
   6.1.10 that take the mechanism name as one of their parameters.

   Parameters:

        mechOid   The oid for the mechanism for which the canonical form
                  of the name is requested.


6.2.6.  export

   public byte[] export() throws GSSException

   Returns a canonical contiguous byte representation of a mechanism
   name (MN), suitable for direct, byte by byte comparison by
   authorization functions.  If the name is not an MN, implementations
   may throw a GSSException with the NAME_NOT_MN status code.  If an
   implementation chooses not to throw an exception, it should use some
   system specific default mechanism to canonicalize the name and then
   export it.  The format of the header of the output buffer is
   specified in RFC 2078.


6.2.7.  toString

   public String toString()

   Returns a textual representation of the GSSName object.  To retrieve
   the printed name format, which determines the syntax of the returned
   string, the getStringNameType method can be used.


6.2.8.  getStringNameType

   public Oid getStringNameType() throws GSSException

   Returns the oid representing the type of name returned through the
   toString method.  Using this oid, the syntax of the printable name
   can be determined.

   public boolean isAnonymous()

   Tests if this name object represents an anonymous entity.  Returns

   public boolean isMN()

   Tests if this name object contains only one mechanism element and is
   thus a mechanism name as defined by RFC 2078.



6.3.  public interface GSSCredential implements Cloneable

   This interface encapsulates the GSS-API credentials for an entity.  A
   credential contains all the necessary cryptographic information to
   enable the creation of a context on behalf of the entity that it
   represents.  It may contain multiple, distinct, mechanism specific
   credential elements, each containing information for a specific
   security mechanism, but all referring to the same entity.

   A credential may be used to perform context initiation, acceptance,
   or both.

   GSS-API implementations must impose a local access-control policy on
   callers to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring credentials to
   which they are not entitled.  GSS-API credential creation is not
   intended to provide a "login to the network" function, as such a
   function would involve the creation of new credentials rather than
   merely acquiring a handle to existing credentials.  Such functions,
   if required, should be defined in implementation-specific extensions
   to the API.

   If credential acquisition is time-consuming for a mechanism, the
   mechanism may choose to delay the actual acquisition until the
   credential is required (e.g.  by GSSContext).  Such mechanism-
   specific implementation decisions should be invisible to the calling
   application; thus the query methods immediately following the
   creation of a credential object must return valid credential data,
   and may therefore incur the overhead of a deferred credential
   acquisition.

   Applications will create a credential object passing the desired

   parameters.  The application can then use the query methods to obtain
   specific information about the instantiated credential object
   (equivalent to the gss_inquire routines).  When the credential is no
   longer needed, the application should call the dispose (equivalent to
   gss_release_cred) method to release any resources held by the
   credential object and to destroy any cryptographically sensitive
   information.

   Classes implementing this interface also implement the Cloneable
   interface. This indicates the the class will support the clone()
   method that will allow the creation of duplicate credentials.  This
   is useful when called just before the add() call to retain a copy of
   the original credential.


6.3.1.  Example Code


   This example code demonstrates the creation of a GSSCredential
   implementation for a specific entity, querying of its fields, and its
   release when it is no longer needed.


   GSSManager mgr = new GSSManager();

   // start by creating a name object for the entity

   Adds a mechanism specific credential-element to an existing
   credential.  This method allows the construction of credentials one
   mechanism at a time.

   This routine is envisioned to be used mainly by context acceptors
   during the creation of acceptance credentials which are to be used
   with a variety of clients using different security mechanisms.

   This routine adds the new credential element "in-place".  To add the
   element in a new credential, first call clone() to obtain a copy of
   this credential, then call its add() method.

   Parameters:

        aName     Name of the principal for whom this credential is to
                  be acquired. Use "null" to specify the default
                  principal.

        initLifetime
                  The number of seconds that credentials should remain
                  valid for initiating of security contexts.  Use
                  GSSCredential.INDEFINITE to request that the
                  credentials have the maximum permitted lifetime.

        acceptLifetime
                  The number of seconds that credentials should remain
                  valid for accepting of security contexts.  Use
                  GSSCredential.INDEFINITE to request that the
                  credentials have the maximum permitted lifetime.

        mechOid   The mechanisms over which the credential is to be
                  acquired.

        usage     The intended usage for this credential object. The
                  value of this parameter must be one of:
                  GSSCredential.ACCEPT_AND_INITIATE,
                  GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY, GSSCredential.INITIATE_ONLY


6.3.13.  equals

   public boolean equals(Object another)

   Tests if this GSSCredential refers to the same entity as the supplied
   object.  The two credentials must be acquired over the same
   mechanisms and must refer to the same principal.  Returns "true" if
   the two GSSCredentials refer to the same entity; "false" otherwise.

   Parameters:

        another   Another GSSCredential object for comparison.

6.4.  public interface GSSContext


   This interface encapsulates the GSS-API security context and provides
   the security services (wrap, unwrap, getMIC, verifyMIC) that are
   available over the context.  Security contexts are established
   between peers using locally acquired credentials.  Multiple contexts
   may exist simultaneously between a pair of peers, using the same or
   different set of credentials.  GSS-API functions in a manner
   independent of the underlying transport protocol and depends on its
   calling application to transport its tokens between peers.

   Before the context establishment phase is initiated, the context
   initiator may request specific characteristics desired of the
   established context.  These can be set using the set methods.  After
   the context is established, the caller can check the actual
   characteristic and services offered by the context using the query
   methods.

   The context establishment phase begins with the first call to the
   init method by the context initiator.  During this phase the
   initSecContext and acceptSecContext methods will produce GSS-API
   authentication tokens which the calling application needs to send to
   its peer.  If an error occurs at any point, an exception will get
   thrown and the code will start executing in a catch block.  If not,
   the normal flow of code continues and the application can make a call
   to the isEstablished() method.  If this method returns false it
   indicates that a token is needed from its peer in order to continue
   the context establishment phase.  A return value of true signals that
   the local end of the context is established.  This may still require
   that a token be sent to the peer, if one is produced by GSS-API.
   During the context establishment phase, the isProtReady() method may
   be called to determine if the context can be used for the per-message
   operations.  This allows applications to use per-message operations
   on contexts which aren't fully established.

   After the context has been established or the isProtReady() method
   returns "true", the query routines can be invoked to determine the
   actual characteristics and services of the established context.  The
   application can also start using the per-message methods of wrap and
   getMIC to obtain cryptographic operations on application supplied
   data.

   When the context is no longer needed, the application should call
   dispose to release any system resources the context may be using.

6.4.3.  initSecContext

   public byte[] initSecContext(byte inputBuf[], int offset, int len)

   Called by the context initiator to start the context creation
   process.  This is equivalent to the stream based method except that
   the token buffers are handled as byte arrays instead of using stream
   objects.  This method may return an output token which the
   application will need to send to the peer for processing by the
   accept call.  "null" return value indicates that no token needs to be
   sent to the peer.  The application can call isEstablished() to
   determine if the context establishment phase is complete for this
   peer.  A return value of "false" from isEstablished() indicates that
   more tokens are expected to be supplied to the initSecContext()
   method.  Note that it is possible that the initSecContext() method
   return a token for the peer, and isEstablished() return "true" also.
   This indicates that the token needs to be sent to the peer, but the

   Upon completion of the context establishment, the available context
   options may be queried through the get methods.

   Parameters:

                  on the first call.

        offset    The offset within the inputBuf where the token begins.

6.4.9.  getWrapSizeLimit

   public int getWrapSizeLimit(int qop, boolean confReq,
                   int maxTokenSize) throws GSSException

   Returns the maximum message size that, if presented to the wrap
   method with the same confReq and qop parameters, will result in an
   output token containing no more than the maxTokenSize bytes.

   This call is intended for use by applications that communicate over
   protocols that impose a maximum message size.  It enables the
   application to fragment messages prior to applying protection.

   GSS-API implementations are recommended but not required to detect
   invalid QOP values when getWrapSizeLimit is called.  This routine
   guarantees only a maximum message size, not the availability of
   specific QOP values for message protection.

   Successful completion of this call does not guarantee that wrap will
   be able to protect a message of the computed length, since this
   ability may depend on the availability of system resources at the
   time that wrap is called.  However, if the implementation itself
   imposes an upper limit on the length of messages that may be
   processed by wrap, the implementation should not return a value that
   is greater than this length.

   Parameters:

        qop       Indicates the level of protection wrap will be asked
                  to provide.

        confReq   Indicates if wrap will be asked to provide privacy

6.4.10.  wrap

   public byte[] wrap(byte inBuf[], int offset, int len,
                   MessageProp msgProp) throws GSSException

   Applies per-message security services over the established security
   context.  The method will return a token with a cryptographic MIC and
   may optionally encrypt the specified inBuf.  This method is
   equivalent in functionality to its stream counterpart.  The returned
   byte array will contain both the MIC and the message.

   The MessageProp object is instantiated by the application and used to
   specify a QOP value which selects cryptographic algorithms, and a
   privacy service to optionally encrypt the message.  The underlying
   mechanism that is used in the call may not be able to provide the
   privacy service.  It sets the actual privacy service that it does
   provide in this MessageProp object which the caller should then query
   upon return.  If the mechanism is not able to provide the requested
   QOP, it throws a GSSException with the BAD_QOP code.

   Since some application-level protocols may wish to use tokens emitted
   by wrap to provide "secure framing", implementations should support
   the wrapping of zero-length messages.

   The application will be responsible for sending the token to the
   peer.

   Parameters:

        inBuf     Application data to be protected.

        offset    The offset within the inBuf where the data begins.

        len       The length of the data within the inBuf (starting at
                  the offset).

        msgProp   Instance of MessageProp that is used by the
                  application to set the desired QOP and privacy state.
                  Set the desired QOP to 0 to request the default QOP.
                  Upon return from this method, this object will contain
                  the the actual privacy state that was applied to the
                  message by the underlying mechanism.

6.4.18.  export

   public byte [] export() throws GSSException

   Provided to support the sharing of work between multiple processes.
   This routine will typically be used by the context-acceptor, in an
   application where a single process receives incoming connection
   requests and accepts security contexts over them, then passes the
   established context to one or more other processes for message
   exchange.

   This method deactivates the security context and creates an
   interprocess token which, when passed to the byte array constructor
   of the GSSContext interface in another process, will re-activate the
   context in the second process.  Only a single instantiation of a
   given context may be active at any one time; a subsequent attempt by
   a context exporter to access the exported security context will fail.

   The implementation may constrain the set of processes by which the
   interprocess token may be imported, either as a function of local
   security policy, or as a result of implementation decisions.  For
   example, some implementations may constrain contexts to be passed
   only between processes that run under the same account, or which are
   part of the same process group.

   The interprocess token may contain security-sensitive information
   (for example cryptographic keys).  While mechanisms are encouraged to
   either avoid placing such sensitive information within interprocess
   tokens, or to encrypt the token before returning it to the
   application, in a typical GSS-API implementation this may not be
   possible.  Thus the application must take care to protect the
   interprocess token, and ensure that any process to which the token is
   transferred is trustworthy.

6.5.  public class MessageProp


   This is a utility class used within the per-message GSSContext
   methods to convey per-message properties.

   When used with the GSSContext interface's wrap and getMIC methods, an
   instance of this class is used to indicate the desired QOP and to
   request if confidentiality services are to be applied to caller
   supplied data (wrap only).  To request default QOP, the value of 0
   should be used for QOP.

   When used with the unwrap and verifyMIC methods of the GSSContext
   interface, an instance of this class will be used to indicate the
   applied QOP and confidentiality services over the supplied message.
   In the case of verifyMIC, the confidentiality state will always be
   "false".  Upon return from these methods, this object will also
   contain any supplementary status values applicable to the processed
   token.  The supplementary status values can indicate old tokens, out
   of sequence tokens, gap tokens or duplicate tokens.

6.6.  public class ChannelBinding


   The GSS-API accommodates the concept of caller-provided channel
   binding information.  Channel bindings are used to strengthen the
   quality with which peer entity authentication is provided during
   context establishment.  They enable the GSS-API callers to bind the
   establishment of the security context to relevant characteristics
   like addresses or to application specific data.

   The caller initiating the security context must determine the
   appropriate channel binding values to set in the GSSContext object.



Expires: May 2000                                              [Page 76]


                          GSS-API Java Bindings             October 1999


   The acceptor must provide an identical binding in order to validate
   that received tokens possess correct channel-related characteristics.

   Use of channel bindings is optional in GSS-API.  Since channel-
   binding information may be transmitted in context establishment
   tokens, applications should therefore not use confidential data as
   channel-binding components.

   and data.  "null" values can be used for any fields which the
   application does not want to specify.

   Parameters:

        initAddr  The address of the context initiator.  "null" value
                  can be supplied to indicate that the application does
                  not want to set this value.

        acceptAddrThe address of the context acceptor.  "null" value can
                  be supplied to indicate that the application does not
                  want to set this value.

        appData   Application supplied data to be used as part of the
                  channel bindings.  "null" value can be supplied to
                  indicate that the application does not want to set
                  this value.


   public ChannelBinding(byte[] appData)

   Creates a ChannelBinding object without any addressing information.

   Parameters:

        appData   Application supplied data to be used as part of the

   WG as outlined in both RFC 2078 and J.  Wray's C-bindings draft for
   the GSS-API.  Many conceptual definitions, implementation directions,
   and explanations have been included from the C-bindings draft.

   We would like to thank Mike Eisler, Lin Ling, Ram Marti, Michael
   Saltz and other members of Sun's development team for their helpful
   input, comments and suggestions.

   We would also like to thank Joe Salowey, and Michael Smith for many
   insightful ideas and suggestions that have contributed to this draft.
