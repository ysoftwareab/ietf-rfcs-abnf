Internet-Draft                savi-roaming                  October 2010


1. Introduction

   This document specifies the procedure for roaming over devices that
   implemented SAVI (Source Address Validation Improvements) device. 
   The binding entry creating by NDP snooping can be synchronized by
   some mechanism.

   There is a mechanism which designed to provide a host level source IP
   address validation granularity([I-D.bi-savi-stateless]), which 
   includes NDP/ARP snooping to set up bindings between stateless IP 
   addresses and corresponding anchors. The bindings can be used to
   validate the source address in the packets. This mechanism is
   deployed on access device(we mainly talk about access switch), named
   SAVI devices.

   The NDP/ARP snooping mechanism in SAVI devices snoop the NDP/ARP
   packets to establish the corresponding binding entry of the host,
   which includes IP address, MAC address, VLAN, port, etc.
   
   The binding entry can filter packets with forged IP addresses,
   including NDP/ARP packet and common data packet. 
   [I-D.ietf-savi-framework-00] describes this filtering precedure.

   This mechanism can nicely filter packets on a SAVI device in one
   access device LAN. If there is two or more SAVI devices, if the host
   roams from one SAVI device to another SAVI device, the following
   issues must be considered: How to aging the binding entry on the
   first SAVI device, and how to defend the forged host while the real
   host can roaming correctly.


2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. Terminology

   Uplink port: The up link port of the access switch. SAVI device is a
                access device, so the snooping and filtering should aim
                at the port connected to user. NDP/ARP snooping can omit
                the learning procedure of binding entry.

4. Problem Statement

   As shown in figure 1, two switches are connected one aggregation
   device (AGG). If one host connects to SWB(Switch B), the

   corresponding binding entry will be established in SWB. When this
   host roams to SWA(Switch A), all involved ports's link state will
   changed, so the corresponding binding entry can established in SWA. 
   But SWB's entry won't be removed immediately. 
 
   The following is the processes:

   1) When the host is removed from SWB, SWB will keep the binding entry
      for a while.

   2) When the host is connected SWA, the link state of the host's net
      card interface will turn up, so the host will send DAD NS.

   3) When SWA receive this packet, it find this is a new host connected
      to it. SWA will establish a new binding entry, and forward this
      packet.

   4) When SWB receives this packet, because the received port is uplink 
      port, so it only forward it.

   5) Because there isn't any host connect the SWB's port which the host
      connected formerly, so this packet will be discarded finally.

   Now, there are two binding entries of one host in two SAVI devices, 
   this is a very confusable condition.

   From the above, the key element of the roaming over SAVI devices is
   uplink port. If the binding entries can be established in this port,
   the roaming can successfully process, but all the SAVI devices will
   have all the host corresponding binding entries. These is a huge
   resource waste.

5. Solution for roaming over devices

   Considering the uplink port snooping, the SAVI device can know the
   host connected others SAVI device, this is a key to promote the
   roaming.
   
   Based on the uplink port, the following procedure is proposed to
   deal with the issue in section 4, the host can roam over SAVI devices.

5.1.  Binding entry establishing

   When the host connects to SWB, the normal binding entry establishing
   procedure([I-D.bi-savi-stateless]) is process in SWB. The DAD NS
   also forward to SWA transit AGG, SWA's uplink port will received this
   packet.

   But SWA must ignore this packet, not to established any binding entry
   to avoid the huge binding table.

5.2.  Binding entry moving

   When the host is roaming to SWA, the following processes happen:

   1) When the host is removed from SWB, SWB will keep the binding entry
      for a while.

   2) When the host is connected SWA, the link state of the host's net
      card interface will turn up, so the host will send DAD NS.

   3) When SWA receive this packet, it find this is a new host connected
      to it. SWA will establish a new binding entry, and forward this
      packet.

   4) When SWB receives this packet, it will analysis this packet as
      normal NDP snooping, so as to find there is a binding entry
      correspond to that host,  only the input port is uplink port.

   5) According this binding entry, SWB sending a normal NS through the
      original port the host connected to probe if or not the host is
      still connected here. Because the host is removed from SWB, so SWB
      can't received any response. 

   6) Then SWB sends a normal NS through the uplink port to probe if
      there is a new host connected other switch. SWA can receive this
      packet and forward it to the host, and the host will respond to
      SWB.

Internet-Draft                savi-roaming                  October 2010


   7) When SWB receives this responding packet, it will remove that
      corresponding binding entry. Because this packet is received in
      uplink port from other switch, SWB can know that other switch have
      established a binding entry of this packet. 

   Now the host have successfully roaming from SWB to SWA, and SWB have
   not the host's corresponding binding entry.

5.3.  Source address selection

   In the process 5) and 6), SWB needs to send a NS packet which source
   IP address must be SWB's IP address. Otherwise, the response packet
   may not be received by SWB, and this mechanism will not take effect.

6. Security Considerations

   There is no security consideration currently.

7. IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA consideration currently.
