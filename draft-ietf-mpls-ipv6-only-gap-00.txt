           Gap Analysis for Operating IPv6-only MPLS Networks
                    draft-ietf-mpls-ipv6-only-gap-00

Abstract

   This document reviews the MPLS protocol suite in the context of IPv6
   and identifies gaps that must be addressed in order to allow MPLS-
   related protocols and applications to be used with IPv6-only
   networks.  This document is not intended to highlight a particular
   vendor's implementation (or lack thereof) in the context of IPv6-only
   MPLS functionality, but rather to focus on gaps in the standards
   defining the MPLS suite.

Internet-Draft                v6-only-mpls                    April 2014


1.  Introduction

   IPv6 is an integral part of modern network deployments.  At the time
   when this document was written, the majority of these IPv6
   deployments were using dual-stack implementations, where IPv4 and
   IPv6 are supported equally on many or all of the network nodes, and
   single-stack primarily referred to IPv4-only devices.  Dual-stack
   deployments provide a useful margin for protocols and features that
   are not currently capable of operating solely over IPv6, because they
   can continue using IPv4 as necessary.  However, as IPv6 deployment
   and usage becomes more pervasive, and IPv4 exhaustion begins driving
   changes in address consumption behaviors, there is an increasing
   likelihood that many networks will need to start operating some or
   all of their network nodes either as primarily IPv6 (most functions
   use IPv6, a few legacy features use IPv4), or as IPv6-only (no IPv4
   provisioned on the device).  This transition toward IPv6-only
   operation exposes any gaps where features, protocols, or
   implementations are still reliant on IPv4 for proper function.  To
   that end, and in the spirit of RFC 6540's [RFC6540] recommendation
   that implementations need to stop requiring IPv4 for proper and
   complete function, this document reviews the Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) protocol suite in the context of IPv6 and identifies
   gaps that must be addressed in order to allow MPLS-related protocols
   and applications to be used with IPv6-only networks.  This document
   is not intended to highlight a particular vendor's implementation (or
   lack thereof) in the context of IPv6-only MPLS functionality, but
   rather to focus on gaps in the standards defining the MPLS suite.

2.  Use Case

   This section discusses some drivers for ensuring that MPLS completely
   supports IPv6-only operation.  It is not intended to be a
   comprehensive discussion of all potential use cases, but rather a
   discussion of at least one use case to provide context and
   justification to undertake such a gap analysis.

   IP convergence is continuing to drive new classes of devices to begin
   communicating via IP.  Examples of such devices could include set top
   boxes for IP Video distribution, cell tower electronics (macro or
   micro cells), infrastructure Wi-Fi Access Points, and devices for
   machine to machine (M2M) or Internet of Things applications.  In some
   cases, these classes of devices represent a very large deployment
   base, on the order of thousands or even millions of devices network-
   wide.  The scale of these networks, coupled with the increasingly
   overlapping use of RFC 1918 [RFC1918] address space within the
   average network, and the lack of globally-routable IPv4 space
   available for long-term growth begins to drive the need for many of
   the endpoints in this network to be managed solely via IPv6.  Even if



George & Pignataro      Expires October 19, 2014                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                v6-only-mpls                    April 2014


   these devices are carrying some IPv4 user data, it is often
   encapsulated in another protocol such that the communication between
   the endpoint and its upstream devices can be IPv6-only without
   impacting support for IPv4 on user data.  As the number of devices to
   manage increases, the operator is compelled to move to IPv6.
   Depending on the MPLS features required, it is plausible to assume
   that the (existing) MPLS network will need to be extended to these
   IPv6-only devices.

   Additionally, as the impact of IPv4 exhaustion becomes more acute,
   more and more aggressive IPv4 address reclamation measures will be
   justified.  Many networks are likely to focus on preserving their
   remaining IPv4 addresses for revenue-generating customers so that
   legacy support for IPv4 can be maintained as long as possible.  As a
   result, it may be appropriate for some or all of the network
   infrastructure, including MPLS LSRs and LERs, to have its IPv4
   addresses reclaimed and transition toward IPv6-only operation.

3.  Gap Analysis

   This gap analysis aims to answer the question, "what breaks when one
   attempts to use MPLS features on a network of IPv6-only devices?"
   The baseline assumption for this analysis is that some endpoints as
   well as Label Switch Routers (PE and P routers) only have IPv6
   transport available, and need to support the full suite of MPLS
   features defined as of the time of this document's writing at parity
   with the support on an IPv4 network.  This is necessary whether they
   are enabled via Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) RFC 5036 [RFC5036],
   Resource Reservation Protocol Extensions for MPLS Traffic Engineering
   (RSVP-TE) RFC 3209 [RFC3209], or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) RFC
   3107 [RFC3107], and whether they are encapsulated in MPLS RFC 3032
   [RFC3032], IP RFC 4023 [RFC4023], Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)
   RFC 4023 [RFC4023], or Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol Version 3 (L2TPv3)
   RFC 4817 [RFC4817].  It is important when evaluating these gaps to
   distinguish between user data and control plane data, because while
   this document is focused on IPv6-only operation, it is quite likely
   that some amount of the user payload data being carried in the
   IPv6-only MPLS network will still be IPv4.

3.1.  MPLS Data Plane

   MPLS labeled packets can be transmitted over a variety of data links
   RFC 3032 [RFC3032], and MPLS labeled packets can also be encapsulated
   over IP.  The encapsulations of MPLS in IP and GRE as well as MPLS
   over L2TPv3 support IPv6.  See Section 3 of RFC 4023 [RFC4023] and
   Section 2 of RFC 4817 [RFC4817] respectively.

   In the case where an IPv4 prefix is resolved over an IPv6 LSP, an
   IPv6 Explicit Null label cannot immediately preceed an IPv4 packet.

   Gap: None.

3.2.  MPLS Control Plane

3.2.1.  LDP

   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) RFC 5036 [RFC5036] defines a set of
   procedures for distribution of labels between label switch routers
   that can use the labels for forwarding traffic.  While LDP was
   designed to use an IPv4 or dual-stack IP network, it has a number of
   deficiencies that prohibit it from working in an IPv6-only network.
   LDP-IPv6 [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-ipv6] highlights some of the deficiencies
   when LDP is enabled in IPv6 only or dual-stack networks, and
   specifies appropriate protocol changes.  These deficiencies are
   related to LSP mapping, LDP identifiers, LDP discovery, LDP session
   establishment, next hop address and LDP TTL security RFC 5082
   [RFC5082] and RFC 6720 [RFC6720].

   Gap: Major, update to RFC 5036 in progress that should close this
   gap.

3.2.2.  Multipoint LDP

   Multipoint LDP (mLDP) is a set of extensions to LDP for setting up
   Point to Multipoint (P2MP) and Multipoint to Multipoint (MP2MP) LSPs.
   These extensions are specified in RFC 6388 [RFC6388].  In terms of
   IPv6-only gap analysis, mLDP has two identified areas of interest:

   1.  LDP Control plane: Since mLDP uses the LDP control plane to
       discover and establish sessions with the peer, it shares the same
       gaps as LDP with regards to control plane (discovery, transport,
       and session establishment) in an IPv6-only network.

   2.  Multipoint (MP) FEC Root address: mLDP defines its own MP FECs
       and rules, different from LDP, to map MP LSPs. mLDP MP FEC
       contains a Root Address field which is an IP address in IP
       networks.  The current specification allows specifying Root
       address according to AFI and hence covers both IPv4 or IPv6 root
       addresses, requiring no extension to support IPv6-only MP LSPs.
       The root address is used by each LSR participating in an MP LSP
       setup such that root address reachability is resolved by doing a
       table lookup against root address to find corresponding upstream
       neighbor(s).  This will pose a problem if an MP LSP traverses
       IPv4-only and IPv6-only nodes in a dual-stack network on the way
       to the root node.

Internet-Draft                v6-only-mpls                    April 2014


   For example, consider following setup, where R1/R6 are IPv4-only, R3/
   R4 are IPv6-only, and R2/R5 are dual-stack LSRs:

   ( IPv4-only )  (  IPv6-only   )  ( IPv4-only )
          R1 -- R2 -- R3 -- R4 -- R5 -- R6
          Leaf                          Root

   Assume R1 to be a leaf node for an P2MP LSP rooted at R6 (root node).
   R1 uses R6's IPv4 address as the Root address in MP FEC.  As the MP
   LSP signaling proceeds from R1 to R6, the MP LSP setup will fail on
   the first IPv6-only transit/branch LSRs (R3) when trying to find IPv4
   root address reachability.  RFC 6512 [RFC6512] defines a recursive-
   FEC solution and procedures for mLDP when the backbone (transit/
   branch) LSRs have no route to the root.  The proposed solution is
   defined for a BGP-free core in an VPN environment, but the similar
   concept can be used/extended to solve the above issue of IPv6-only
   backbone receiving an MP FEC element with an IPv4 address.  The
   solution will require a border LSR (the one which is sitting on
   border of an IPv4/IPv6 island(s) (R2 and R5) to translate an IPv4
   root address to equivalent IPv6 address (and vice vera) through the
   procedures similar to RFC6512.  The translation of root address on
   borders of IPv4 or IPv6 islands will also be needed for recursive
   FECs and procedures defined in RFC6512.

   Gap: Major, update in progress for LDP via LDP-IPv6
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-ipv6], may need additional updates to RFC6512.

3.2.3.  RSVP- TE

   Resource Reservation Protocol Extensions for MPLS Traffic Engineering
   (RSVP-TE) RFC 3209 [RFC3209] defines a set of procedures &
   enhancements to establish label-switched tunnels that can be
   automatically routed away from network failures, congestion, and
   bottlenecks.  RSVP-TE allows establishing an LSP for an IPv4 or IPv6
   prefix, thanks to its LSP_TUNNEL_IPv6 object and subobjects.

   Gap: None

3.2.3.1.  IGP

   RFC3630 [RFC3630] specifies a method of adding traffic engineering
   capabilities to OSPF Version 2.  New TLVs and sub-TLVs were added in
   RFC5329 [RFC5329] to extend TE capabilities to IPv6 networks in OSPF
   Version 3.

   RFC5305 [RFC5305] specifies a method of adding traffic engineering
   capabilities to IS-IS.  New TLVs and sub-TLVs were added in RFC6119
   [RFC6119] to extend TE capabilities to IPv6 networks.

   Gap: None

3.2.3.2.  RSVP-TE-P2MP

   RFC4875 [RFC4875] describes extensions to RSVP-TE for the setup of
   point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs in MPLS and GMPLS with support for
   both IPv4 and IPv6.

   Gap: None

3.2.3.3.  RSVP-TE Fast Reroute (FRR)

   RFC4090 [RFC4090] specifies FRR mechanisms to establish backup LSP
   tunnels for local repair supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
   Further RFC5286 [RFC5286] describes the use of loop-free alternates
   to provide local protection for unicast traffic in pure IP and MPLS
   networks in the event of a single failure, whether link, node, or
   shared risk link group (SRLG) for both IPv4 and IPv6.

   Gap: None

3.2.4.  Controller, PCE

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in RFC4655 [RFC4655] is an
   entity that is capable of computing a network path or route based on
   a network graph, and applying computational constraints.  A Path
   Computation Client (PCC) may make requests to a PCE for paths to be
   computed.  The PCE communication protocol (PCEP) is designed as a
   communication protocol between PCCs and PCEs for path computations
   and is defined in RFC5440 [RFC5440].

   The PCEP specification RFC5440 [RFC5440] is defined for both IPv4 and
   IPv6 with support for PCE discovery via an IGP (OSPF RFC5088
   [RFC5088], or ISIS RFC5089 [RFC5089]) using both IPv4 and IPv6
   addresses.  Note that PCEP uses identical encoding of subobjects as
   in the Resource Reservation Protocol Traffic Engineering Extensions
   (RSVP-TE) defined in RFC3209 [RFC3209] which supports both IPv4 and
   IPv6.

   The extensions of PCEP to support confidentiality RFC5520 [RFC5520],
   Route Exclusion RFC5521, [RFC5521] Monitoring RFC5886 [RFC5886], and
   P2MP RFC6006 [RFC6006] have support for both IPv4 and IPv6.

   Gap: None.

3.2.5.  BGP

   RFC3107 [RFC3107] specifies a set of BGP protocol procedures for
   distributing the labels (for prefixes corresponding to any address-
   family) between label switch routers so that they can use the labels
   for forwarding the traffic.  RFC3107 allows BGP to distribute the
   label for IPv4 or IPv6 prefix in an IPv6 only network.

   Gap: None.

3.2.6.  GMPLS

   RFC4558 [RFC4558] specifies Node-ID Based RSVP Hello Messages with
   capability for both IPv4 and IPv6.  RFC4990 [RFC4990] clarifies the
   use of IPv6 addresses in GMPLS networks including handling in the MIB
   modules.

   Section 5.3, second paragraph of RFC6370 [RFC6370] describes the
   mapping from an MPLS-TP LSP_ID to RSVP-TE with an assumption that
   Node_IDs are derived from valid IPv4 addresses.  This assumption
   fails in an IPv6-only network, given that there wouldn't be any IPv4
   addresses.

   Gap: Minor; Section 5.3. of RFC6370 needs to be updated.

3.3.  MPLS Applications

3.3.1.  L2VPN

   L2VPN RFC 4664 [RFC4664] specifies two fundamentally different kinds
   of Layer 2 VPN services that a service provider could offer to a
   customer: Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) and Virtual Private LAN
   Service (VPLS).  RFC 4447 [RFC4447] and RFC 4762 [RFC4762] specify
   the LDP protocol changes to instantiate VPWS and VPLS services
   respectively in an MPLS network using LDP as the signaling protocol.
   This is complemented by RFC 6074 [RFC6074], which specifies a set of
   procedures for instantiating L2VPNs (e.g. VPWS, VPLS) using BGP as
   discovery protocol and LDP as well as L2TPv3 as signaling protocol.
   RFC 4761 [RFC4761] and RFC 6624 [RFC6624] specify BGP protocol
   changes to instantiate VPLS and VPWS services in an MPLS network,
   using BGP for both discovery and signaling.

   In an IPv6-only MPLS network, use of L2VPN represents connection of
   Layer 2 islands over an IPv6 MPLS core, and very few changes are
   necessary to support operation over an IPv6-only network.  The L2VPN
   signaling protocol is either BGP or LDP in an MPLS network, and both
   can run directly over IPv6 core infrastructure, as well as IPv6 edge
   devices.  RFC 6074 [RFC6074] is the only RFC that appears to have a

   gap for IPv6-only operation.  In its discovery procedures (section
   3.2.2 and section 6), it suggests encoding PE IP address in the VSI-
   ID, which is encoded in NLRI, and should not exceed 12 bytes (to
   differentiate its AFI/SAFI encoding from RFC4761).  This means that
   PE IP address can NOT be an IPv6 address.  Also, in its signaling
   procedures (section 3.2.3), it suggests encoding PE_addr in SAII and
   TAII, which are limited to 32-bit (AII Type=1) at the moment.

   RFC 6073 [RFC6073] defines the new LDP PW Switching Point PE TLV,
   which supports IPv4 and IPv6.

   Gap: Minor.  RFC6074 needs to be updated.

3.3.1.1.  EVPN

   EVPN [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn] is still a work in progress.  As such, it
   is out of scope for this gap analysis.  Instead, the authors of that
   draft need to ensure that it supports IPv6-only operation, or if it
   cannot, identify dependencies on underlying gaps in MPLS protocol(s)
   that must be resolved before it can support IPv6-only operation.

3.3.2.  L3VPN

   RFC 4364 [RFC4364] defines a method by which a Service Provider may
   use an IP backbone to provide IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for
   its customers.  The following use cases arise in the context of this
   gap analysis:

   1.  Connecting IPv6 islands over IPv6-only MPLS network

   2.  Connecting IPv4 islands over IPv6-only MPLS network

   Both use cases require mapping an IP packet to an IPv6-signaled LSP.
   RFC4364 defines a VPN-IPv4 address family, but not a VPN-IPv6 address
   family.  RFC 4659 [RFC4659] corrects this oversight.  Also, Section 5
   of RFC 4364 [RFC4364] assumes that the BGP next-hop contains exactly
   32 bits.  This text should be generalized to include 128 bit next-
   hops as well.  Section 3.2.1.1 of RFC 4659 [RFC4659] does actually
   specifies a 128-bit BGP next-hop.

   The authors do not believe that there are any additional issues
   encountered when using L2TPv3, RSVP, or GRE (instead of MPLS) as
   transport on an IPv6-only network.

   Gap: Major.  RFC4364 must be updated, and RFC4659 may need to be
   updated to explicitly cover use case #2.  (Discussed in further
   detail below)

3.3.2.1.  6PE/4PE

   RFC 4798 [RFC4798] defines 6PE, which defines how to interconnect
   IPv6 islands over a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)-enabled IPv4
   cloud.  However, use case 2 is doing the opposite, and thus could
   also be referred to as 4PE.  The method to support this use case is
   not defined explicitly.  To support it, IPv4 edge devices need to be
   able to map IPv4 traffic to MPLS IPv6 core LSP's. Also, the core
   switches may not understand IPv4 at all, but in some cases they may
   need to be able to exchange Labeled IPv4 routes from one AS to a
   neighboring AS.

   Gap: Major.  RFC4798 covers only the "6PE" case.  Use case #2 is
   currently not specified in an RFC.

3.3.2.2.  6VPE/4VPE

   RFC 4659 [RFC4659] defines 6VPE, a method by which a Service Provider
   may use its packet-switched backbone to provide Virtual Private
   Network (VPN) services for its IPv6 customers.  It allows the core
   network to be MPLS IPv4 or MPLS IPv6, thus addressing use case 1
   above.  RFC4364 should work as defined for use case 2 above, which
   could also be referred to as 4VPE, but the RFC does not explicitly
   discuss this use.

   Gap: Minor.  RFC4659 may need to be updated to explicitly cover use
   case #2

3.3.2.3.  BGP Encapsulation SAFI

   RFC 5512 [RFC5512] defines the BGP Encapsulation SAFI and the BGP
   Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute, which can be used to signal tunneling
   over a single-Address Family IP core.  This mechanism supports
   transport of MPLS (and other protocols) over Tunnels in an IP core
   (including an IPv6-only core).  In this context, load-balancing can
   be provided as specified in RFC 5640 [RFC5640].

   Gap: None.

3.3.2.4.  NG-MVPN

   RFC 6513 [RFC6513] defines the procedure to provide multicast service
   over MPLS VPN backbone for the customers.  The procedure involves the
   below set of protocols:

3.3.2.4.1.  PE-CE Multicast Routing Protocol

   RFC 6513 [RFC6513] explains the use of PIM as PE-CE protocol while
   Section 11.1.2 of RFC 6514 [RFC6514] explains the use of mLDP as PE-
   CE protocol.

   The MCAST-VPN NLRI route-type format defined in RFC 6514 [RFC6514] is
   not sufficiently covering all scenarios when mLDP is used as PE-CE
   protocol.  The issue is explained in section 2 of
   [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-mldp-nlri] along with new route-type that
   encodes the mLDP FEC in NLRI.

   Further [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-pe-ce] defines the use of BGP as PE-CE
   protocol.

   Gap: None.

3.3.2.4.2.  P-Tunnel Instantiation

   RFC 6513 [RFC6513] explains the use of the below tunnels:

   o  RSVP-TE P2MP LSP

   o  PIM Tree

   o  mLDP P2MP LSP

   o  mLDP MP2MP LSP

   o  Ingress Replication

   Gap: Gaps in RSVP-TE P2MP LSP and mLDP P2MP and MP2MP LSP are covered
   in previous sections.

   PIM Tree and Ingress Replication are out of the scope of this
   document.

3.3.2.4.3.  PE-PE Multicast Routing Protocol

   Section 3.1 of RFC 6513 [RFC6513] explains the use of PIM as PE-PE
   protocol while RFC 6514 [RFC6514] explains the use of BGP as PE-PE
   protocol.

   Gap: Any gaps in PIM or BGP as PE-PE Multicast Routing protocol are
   outside the scope of this document

3.3.3.  MPLS-TP

   MPLS-TP does not require IP (see section 2 of RFC 5921 [RFC5921]) and
   should not be affected by operation on an IPv6-only network.
   Therefore this is considered out of scope for this document.

   Gap: None.

3.4.  MPLS OAM

   For MPLS LSPs, there are primarily three OAM mechanisms: Extended
   ICMP RFC 4884 [RFC4884] RFC 4950 [RFC4950], LSP Ping RFC 4379
   [RFC4379], and BFD for MPLS LSPs RFC 5884 [RFC5884].  For MPLS
   Pseudowires, there is also Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification
   (VCCV) RFC 5085 [RFC5085] RFC 5885 [RFC5885].  All of these
   mechanisms work in pure IPv6 environments.  The next subsections
   cover these in detail.

   Gap: Major.  RFC4379 needs to be updated for multipath IPv6.
   Additionally, there is potential for dropped messages in Extended
   ICMP and LSP ping due to IP version mismatches.  It is important to
   note that this is a more generic problem with tunneling when IP
   address family mismatches exist, and is not specific to MPLS, so
   while MPLS will be affected, it will be difficult to fix this problem
   specifically for MPLS, rather than fixing the more generic problem.

3.4.1.  Extended ICMP

   Extended ICMP to support Multi-part messages is defined in RFC 4884
   [RFC4884].  This extensibility is defined generally for both ICMPv4
   and ICMPv6.  The specific ICMP extensions for MPLS are defined in RFC
   4950 [RFC4950].  ICMP Multi-part with MPLS extensions works for IPv4
   and IPv6.  However, the mechanisms described in RFC 4884 and 4950 may
   fail when tunneling IPv4 traffic over an LSP that is supported by
   IPv6-only infrastructure.

   Assume the following:

   o  the path between two IPv4 only hosts contains an MPLS LSP

   o  the two routers that terminate the LSP run dual stack

   o  the LSP interior routers run IPv6 only

   o  the LSP is signaled over IPv6

   Now assume that one of the hosts sends an IPv4 packet to the other.
   However, the packet's TTL expires on an LSP interior router.



George & Pignataro      Expires October 19, 2014               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                v6-only-mpls                    April 2014


   According to RFC 3032 [RFC3032], the interior router should examine
   the IPv4 payload, format an ICMPv4 message, and send it (over the
   tunnel upon which the original packet arrived) to the egress LSP.  In
   this case, however, the LSP interior router is not IPv4-aware.  It
   cannot parse the original IPv4 datagram, nor can it send an IPv4
   message.  So, no ICMP message is delivered to the source.  Some
   specific ICMP extensions, in particular ICMP Extensions for Interface
   and Next-Hop Identification RFC 5837 [RFC5837] restrict the address
   family of address information included in an Interface Information
   Object to the same one as the ICMP (see Section 4.5 of RFC 5837).
   While these extensions are not MPLS specific, they can be used with
   MPLS packets carrying IP datagrams.  This has no implications for
   IPv6-only environments.

   Gap: Major.  IP version mismatches may cause dropped messages.
   However, as noted in the previous section, this problem is not
   specific to MPLS.

3.4.2.  LSP Ping

   The LSP Ping mechanism defined in RFC 4379 [RFC4379] is specified to
   work with IPv6.  Specifically, the Target FEC Stacks include both
   IPv4 and IPv6 versions of all FECs (see Section 3.2 of RFC 4379).
   The only exceptions are the Pseudowire FECs later specified for IPv6
   in RFC 6829 [RFC6829].

   The multipath information includes also IPv6 encodings (see
   Section 3.3.1 of RFC 4379).

   RFC 4379 does not define the value to be used in the IPv6 Router
   Alert option (RAO).  For IPv4 RAO, a value of zero is used.  However,
   there is no equivalent value for IPv6 RAO.  This gap needs to be
   fixed to be able to use LSP Ping in IPv6 networks.

   Additionally, LSP Ping packets are UDP packets over both IPv4 and
   IPv6 (see Section 4.3 of RFC 4379).  However, for IPv6, the
   destination IP address is a (randomly chosen) IPv6 address from the
   range 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:127/104.  That is, using an IPv4-mapped IPv6
   address.  This is a transitional mechanism that should not bleed into
   IPv6-only networks, as [I-D.itojun-v6ops-v4mapped-harmful] explains.
   The issue is that the MPLS LSP Ping mechanism needs a range of
   loopback IP addresses to be used as destination addresses to exercise
   ECMPs, but the IPv6 address architecture specifies a single address
   (::1/128) for loopback.  A mechanism to achieve this was proposed in
   [I-D.smith-v6ops-larger-ipv6-loopback-prefix].

Internet-Draft                v6-only-mpls                    April 2014


   Another gap is that the mechanisms described in RFC 4379 may fail
   when tunneling IPv4 traffic over an LSP that is supported by
   IPv6-only infrastructure.

   Assume the following:

   o  LSP Ping is operating in traceroute mode over an MPLS LSP

   o  the two routers that terminate the LSP run dual stack

   o  the LSP interior routers run IPv6 only

   o  the LSP is signaled over IPv6

   Packets will expire at LSP interior routers.  According to RFC 4379,
   the interior router must parse the IPv4 Echo Request, and then, send
   an IPv4 Echo Reply.  However, the LSP interior router is not
   IPv4-aware.  It cannot parse the IPv4 Echo Request, nor can it send
   an IPv4 Echo Reply.  So, no reply is sent.

   The mechanism described in RFC 4379 also does not sufficiently
   explain the behaviour in certain IPv6-specific scenarios.  For
   example, RFC 4379 defines the K value as 28 octets when Address
   Family is set to IPv6 Unnumbered, but it doesn't describe how to
   carry a 32 bit LSR Router ID in the 128 bit Downstream IP Address
   Field.

   Gap: Major.  LSP ping uses IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses, IP version
   mismatches may cause dropped messages, unclear mapping from LSR
   Router ID to Downstream IP Address.

3.4.3.  BFD OAM

   The BFD specification for MPLS LSPs RFC 5884 [RFC5884] is defined for
   IPv4 as well as IPv6 versions of MPLS FECs (see Section 3.1 of RFC
   5884).  Additionally the BFD packet is encapsulated over UDP and
   specified to run over both IPv4 and IPv6 (see Section 7 of RFC 5884).

   Gap: None.

3.4.4.  Pseudowire OAM

   The OAM specifications for MPLS Pseudowires define usage for both
   IPv4 and IPv6.  Specifically, VCCV RFC 5085 [RFC5085] can carry IPv4
   or IPv6 OAM packets (see Section 5.1.1 and 5.2.1 of RFC 5085), and
   VCCV for BFD RFC 5885 [RFC5885] also defines an IPv6 encapsulation
   (see Section 3.2 of RFC 5885).

Internet-Draft                v6-only-mpls                    April 2014


   Additionally, for LSP Ping for Pseudowires, the Pseudowire FECs are
   specified for IPv6 in RFC 6829 [RFC6829].

   Gap: None.

3.4.5.  MPLS-TP OAM

   As with MPLS-TP, MPLS-TP OAM RFC 6371 [RFC6371] is not dependent on
   IP or existing MPLS OAM functions, and should not be affected by
   operation on an IPv6-only network.  Therefore, this is out of scope
   for this document.

   Gap: None.

3.5.  MIBs

   RFC3811 [RFC3811] defines the textual conventions for MPLS.  These
   lack support for IPv6 in defining MplsExtendedTunnelId and
   MplsLsrIdentifier.  These textual conventions are used in the MPLS TE
   MIB specification RFC3812 [RFC3812], GMPLS TE MIB specification
   RFC4802 [RFC4802] and Fast ReRoute (FRR) extension RFC6445 [RFC6445].
   3811bis [I-D.manral-mpls-rfc3811bis] tries to resolve this gap by
   marking this textual convention as obsolete.

   The other MIB specifications for LSR RFC3813 [RFC3813], LDP RFC3815
   [RFC3815] and TE RFC4220 [RFC4220] have support for both IPv4 and
   IPv6.

   Gap: Major.  Work underway to update RFC3811, may also need to update
   RFC3812, RFC4802, and RFC6445, which depend on it.

4.  Gap Summary

   This draft has reviewed a wide variety of MPLS features and protocols
   to determine their suitability for use on IPv6-only networks.  While
   some parts of the MPLS suite will function properly without
   additional changes, gaps have been identified in others, which will
   need to be addressed with follow-on work.  This section will
   summarize those gaps, along with pointers to any work-in-progress to
   address them.
