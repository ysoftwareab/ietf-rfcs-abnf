Internet-Draft           <Multicast mobility slicing>       Oct 30,2016

1. Introduction
   
   In the 5G era, the mobile network functions and mobile services 
   could be provided on demand basis using network function 
   virtualizaton (NFV) and network slicing. This document describes the 
   architecture of delivering the mobility and multicast services 
   over 5G core network using NFV and network slicing. The mobility and
   multicast are delivered to customers depending on their type of
   traffic that they are going to request or mobile operator's specific
   use cases. This architecture makes use of advanced features of 
   current distributed mobility management deployment and management
   and orchestration framework (MANO) of network function virtualizaton
   This architecture provides a real view of deployment of mobility
   and mulicast functions in 5G core network.

Internet-Draft           <Multicast mobility slicing>       Oct 30,2016

   Fig 1. shows the architecture for delivering multicast and mobility
services over core network using network slicing. In this document, we
assume that mobility and multicast services could be provided using 
DMM functions, such as CMA, DMA. Those DMM functions are covered in
[IETF-DMM-deployment-model] and [IETF-DMM-multicast-deployment-model].
In 5G network, the concepts of MANO and slicing are introduced to 
increase the network resource efficiency, elasticity, and flexibility.
The mobile network services should be provided on the demand basis and
optimized for a specific use case using network slicing. We observe 
that there are several use cases that have different requirements 
for mobility and multicast services as below.
   + Only multicast: public safety, video broadcast over sport area
   + Only mobility: user with non-video traffic (web surfing)
   + Multicast and mobility: user with video traffic

   We introduce the architecture to provide network slice on demand and
suitable for each use case. Here, we have three network slices: the 
only mulicast slice providing video streaming services for public 
safety or sport event use cases; the only mobility slice providing
services for non-video traffic users; and the mobility and mulicast 
slice providing services for video traffic users. Here, user traffic
could be classified as video and non-video traffic beforing entering
to the specific slice. 
   
   Main components of our architecture includes: specific VNF managers
(mobility VNF manager, multicast broadcast VNF managers), specific
network controlers (mobility controler, multicast broadcast controlers)
and a combined orchestration service. The specific VNF managers are 
used to instantiate, configure, and manage DMM functions. These 
DMM functions are described by VNF descriptors. The specific network
controlers are used to configure virtual networks corresponding to 
functions supported by each slice. A flowvisor is used to create 
different network slices over common network infrastructure. A combined
orchestration service based on operator's requirements to compose
different DMM functions to provide appropriate network services.
