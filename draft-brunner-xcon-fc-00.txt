Abstract

 
 This documents lists issues and requierements for floor control in
  
conferencing applications. It is meant in addition to the existing
  
requirements draft "raft-koskelainen". It basically proposes to do
   floor
control in a policy less way. Meaning that the policies are
   built into
the floor dcontrol server, but not part of the protocol.

Internet-Draft          Issues in Floor
Control             October 2003


1. Introduction

   Floor control is a
mechnism used to deal with concurrecy in
   distributed systems. So it
basically deals with the question who is
   allowed to generate input or
change/write to a resource.

   In the context of conferencing systems floor
control has two
   different goals. First it is about who is allowed to
"speak" by
   sending data input into the conference, so has to do with
access
   control. Second, there are some applications which also require
the
   ordering of input in order to work correctly (single
input/sequential
   input applications). In the laterc ase floor control can
help to
   create correctly functioning
applications.

2. Terminology

   floor
- the right to generate some input.

   floor control - determines at any
given point in time, which entity
   is allowed to provide input, where
entity could mean a user or an
   automated application.

   floor holder -
user currently allowed to provide input.

   floor control mechanisms - the
low-level protocol handling the floor
   control.

   floor control policy -
the rules for a certain operation of floor
  
control.

3. Issues

3.1 Scope of
the floor

   The floor can be assigned to various entities. E.g., a floor
for a
   single session, an application, a conference. We assume an
  
application can have several session, and a conference can have
   several
applications. The floor can be bound to any of these
   entities. There is
naturally a dependency on what application the
   floor control mechnisms is
used for.

3.2 Number of users concurrently holding the floor

   It is
possible that several users concurrently hold the floor. For
   example, in
the case of audio input to the conference, it is then
   mixed together.
Other applications such as shared workspaces/
   application sharing might
have a problem with concurrent input.

3.3 Floor Control Policies

   Floor
control policies define the way how the floor is passed around.
   Here are
some examples of floor passing:

   - ring passing: the current floor holder
must explicitly release the
   flooer before anyone else can axquire it.

  
- Preemptive: any user can grab the floor at any time

   - Timeouts: a user
looses the floor after a period of inactivity or
   after a given time
holding it.

   - Moderated: a designated user has control over passing the
floor.

   - IETF meetings: mostly moderated with queueing of floor
requests.

3.4 Explicite versus implicite floor passing

   Explicite floor
passing requieres an explicit action of a user
   passing the floor.
Implicit floor passing automatically gives the
   floor to a user as soon as
he generates input. Implicit floor passing
   together with a preemtive
policy corresponds actually to the case of
   having no floor control at
all. For conversations this means also
   that a social protocl and etiques
is needed.

   Implicit floor passing is much easier from users point of
view, since
   no expicit action is requiered. Since the floor might be
passed
   implicitly there need to be a group of users eligible to get the
 
 floor, where others might not get the floor implicitly. In the
IETF

   meeting example, the floor can implicitly pass between all
the people
   having a microphone, where others waiting in the queue are
not
   eligable for getting the floor implicitly.

3.5 Floor passing
trigger

   In implicit floor passing there needs to be a trigger to pass
the
   floor automatically. Specifically in multi-application/session
  
conference the trigger can be chosen freely. E.g., the person start
  
speaking also get the floor for the shared whiteboard etc.

3.6 Activity
awareness

   In conferencing scenarios users normally want to be aware what
is
   going only. So for exmple they might want to know who currently has
  
the floor etc.

4. Requirements

     
MUST allow for various scopes

      MUST have single and concurrent floor
holders

      MUST be independent of a particular floor control policy.
The
      policy should be part of a particular implementation, not of the
 
    mechnisms itself.

      MUST be able to restrict the group of users
eligible for implicit
      floor passing.

      MUST provide means for
distributed floor information (e.g.,
      current floor holder to other
participants

      SHOULD allow for transporting  trigger filter
information. What
      triggers the implicite floor control
change
