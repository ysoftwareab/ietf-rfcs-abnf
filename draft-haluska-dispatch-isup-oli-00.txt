Abstract

   A SIP URI parameter "isup-oli" is being used for interworking the
   ISUP Originating Line Information parameter or equivalent PSTN
   signaling information with SIP. This parameter has been also been
   discussed in various documentation, but nowhere is it formally
   documented. This document formally documents the usage, syntax, and
   semantics of this parameter, providing a reference for discussion of
   this parameter. It does not seek to achieve standardization of this
   parameter.

1. Introduction

   In the North American PSTN, information describing the class of
   service for a call, which effectively characterizes the originator,
   is carried in signaling messages. In ANSI ISUP [ANSI-ISUP], this is
   carried in the North American specific Originating Line Information
   (OLI) parameter. In MF signaling, it is carried in the ANI II

   digits. In either case the parameter carries a two-digit value; a
   few examples include 07- "Special Operator Handling Required", 29-
   "prison/inmate service", 34- "Telco Operator Handled Call"..

   The isup-oli SIP URI parameter is being used for interworking the
   OLI information between PSTN signaling and SIP at a gateway. There
   is currently no formal documentation of this parameter. This
   document intends to provide a description of the parameter. It does
   not aim to achieve standardization of this parameter. It describes
   the formal syntax, usage, and semantics of the parameter as
   currently implemented.


2. Usage

   PSTN gateways are used to interwork between PSTN signaling and SIP
   [RFC3261]. In North America, ANSI ISUP and various flavors of MF
   signaling are the most commonly used PSTN signaling protocols.

   The Originating Line Information conveys information describing the
   class of service for a call, which effectively characterizes the
   originator. It is signaled in ANSI ISUP using the OLI parameter, and
   in MF it is signaled in the ANI II digits. In either case, the
   information is conveyed using a two digit value.

   The OLI information from the PSTN signaling is mapped to the isup-
   oli SIP URI parameter. Since the PSTN OLI provides information about
   the originating line, the isup-oli SIP URI parameter is also used to
   describe the originator; e.g., in the From header of the INVITE.

   For interworking from ISUP to SIP, if the incoming IAM contains an
   OLI parameter, and if the gateway populates the From header of the
   corresponding SIP INVITE message with a SIP URI based on the ISUP
   Calling Party Number parameter, then the gateway also includes the
   isup-oli SIP URI parameter populated with the numeric value of the
   received ISUP OLI parameter.

   For example, if the gateway receives an incoming IAM message with
   calling party number 732-758-5735, and OLI value of "29", then the
   gateway includes in the outgoing SIP INVITE message the following
   From header:

   From: sip:+1-732-758-5735@example.com;user=phone;isup-oli=29

   Similarly, if incoming MF signaling includes ANI II information, it
   is mapped to the isup-oli SIP URI parameter in the From header of
   the corresponding INVITE.

   Likewise, when a gateway receives SIP signaling containing the isup-
   oli SIP URI parameter, it is mapped to the appropriate PSTN
   signaling, i.e., the ISUP OLI parameter, or MF II digits.





3. Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in [RFC-2234].

   The isup-oli parameter is a SIP URI parameter. Per the ABNF in RFC
   3261 Section 25.1 it is a "uri-parameter". The formal syntax is:



   isup-oli       = ";isup-oli=" oli-value

   oli-value         = 2*(DIGIT)



   The "isup-oli" SIP URI parameter is optional. It can be included at
   most once in a SIP URI.




4. Semantics

   When a SIP URI describing the originator of a session contains an
   isup-oli parameter, the intended semantic is that the "class of
   service" defined for this session by that isup-oli value applies to
   the entity described by that SIP URI. For example, if a From header
   contains a SIP URI with an isup-oli parameter with value "29"
   indicating "prison/inmate service", this means that the call/session
   is characterized as originating from a prison/inmate access. This
   follows directly from the mapping of the OLI information in the PSTN
   signaling to the SIP signaling.



   Population and interpretation of "oli-value" is taken from the ANI
   II values registry maintained by the North American Numbering Plan
   Administration (NANPA) at

   http://www.nanpa.com/number_resource_info/ani_ii_assignments.html.
   That is, the value is in the format of exactly two digits, with the
   interpretation as given in the registry.

   In PSTN signaling, the OLI provides information about the class of
   service at the originating access for a call, which effectives
   characterizes the originator. Thus, the isup-oli SIP URI parameter
   is only meaningful when associated with the originator of a session.




5. Security Considerations

   This document describes a parameter currently in use; it does not
   define a new protocol mechanism. This section is provided to
   identify potential risks with the use of this parameter.

   The isup-oli parameter conveys information of a private nature. In
   the PSTN this information is not shared with end users; similar
   steps should be taken with the isup-oli parameter to prevent
   disclosure to unintended recipients.

   In the PSTN, OLI information is populated by trusted network
   equipment, not by end user equipment. This should also apply to SIP
   signaling.

   If the isup-oli value can be tampered with, a caller may be able to
   access services which would otherwise be unavailable. For example if
   an isup-oli for a call from a prison/inmate access could be changed
   to another value, or removed completely, then the appropriate
   restrictions would not be applied to the call. Likewise an attacker
   could modify the OLI value to one with greater restrictions,
   limiting the services that the caller would otherwise legitimately
   access. Restricting the use of this parameter between domains with
   an appropriate trust level and using security mechanisms which
   provide message integrity, such as TLS, can mitigate these risks.





6. IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any action of IANA. It simply
   documents the current usage of the isup-oli SIP URI parameter.
