     Abstract  

        The migration from Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic 
        Engineering (TE) to Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) is the process of 
        evolving an MPLS-TE control plane to a GMPLS control plane. An 
        appropriate migration strategy can be selected based on various 
        factors including the service provider's network deployment plan, 
        customer demand, and operational policy. 

        This document presents several migration models and strategies for 
        migrating from MPLS-TE to GMPLS and notes that in the course of

        migration MPLS-TE and GMPLS devices or networks may coexist which may 
        require interworking between MPLS-TE and GMPLS protocols. The 
        applicability? of the interworking that is required is discussed as 
        it appears to influence the choice of a migration strategy.

     1. Introduction 

        Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) to 
        Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) migration is the process of evolving an 
        MPLS-TE-based control plane to a GMPLS-based control plane. The 
        network under consideration is, therefore, a packet-switching network. 

        There are several motivations for such migration and they focus 
        mainly on the desire to take advantage of new features and functions 
        that have been added to the GMPLS protocols but which are not present 
        in MPLS-TE. 

        Although an appropriate migration strategy can be selected based on 
        various factors including the service provider's network deployment 
        plan, customer demand, deployed network equipments, operational 
        policy, etc., the transition mechanisms used should also provide 
        consistent operation of GMPLS networks while minimizing the impact on 
        the operation of existing MPLS-TE networks.  

        In the course of migration MPLS-TE and GMPLS devices or networks may 
        need to coexist. Such cases may occur as parts of the network are 
        migrated from MPLS-TE protocols to GMPLS protocols. Additionally, as 
        part of the preparation for migrating a packet-switching network from 
        MPLS-TE to GMPLS, it may be desirable to first migrate a lower-layer 
        network from having control plane to using a GMPLS control plane, and 
        this can also lead to the need for MPLS-TE/GMPLS interworking.  

        This document describes several migration strategies and shows the 
        interworking scenarios that arise during migration, and examines the 
        implications for network deployments and for protocol usage. Since 
        GMPLS signaling and routing protocols are different from the MPLS-TE 
        control protocols, interworking between MPLS-TE and GMPLS networks or 
        network elements needs mechanisms to compensate for the differences. 

        Note that MPLS-TE and GMPLS protocols can co-exist as "ships in the 
        night" without any interworking issue. 

        Also note that, in this document, the term "MPLS" is used to refer to 
        MPLS-TE protocols only ([RFC3209], [RFC3630], [RFC3473]) and excludes 
        other MPLS protocols such as the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).TE 
        functionalities of MPLS could be migrated to GMPLS-TE, but non-TE 
        functionalities could not.

        "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document 
        are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] in order to 
        clarify the recommendations that are made. 

        In the rest of this document, the term "GMPLS" includes both packet 
        switching capable (PSC) and non-PSC. Otherwise the term "PSC GMPLS" 
        or "non-PSC GMPLS" is explicitly used. 

        In general, the term "MPLS" is used to indicate MPLS traffic 
        engineering (MPLS-TE). If non-TE MPLS is intended, it is explicitly 
        indicated. 

        The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology introduced 
        in [RFC3945]. 

     3. Motivations for Migration 

        Motivations for migration will vary for different service providers. 
        This section is only presented to provide background so that the 
        migration discussions may be seen in the context. Sections 4 and 5 
        illustrate the migration models and processes with possible examples. 

        Migration of an MPLS-capable LSR to include GMPLS capabilities may be 
        performed for one or more reasons, including, no exhaustively: 

        o  To add all GMPLS capabilities to an existing MPLS network. 

        o  To add a GMPLS network without upgrading existing MPLS PSC LSRs. 

        o  To pick up specific GMPLS features and operate them within an MPLS 
           PSC network.  

        o  To allow existing MPLS-capable LSRs to interoperate with new LSRs 
           that only support GMPLS. 

        o  To integrate multiple networks managed by separate administrative 
           organizations, which independently utilize MPLS or GMPLS.  

        o  To build integrated PSC and non-PSC networks where the non-PSC 
           networks can only be controlled by GMPLS since MPLS does not  
           operate in non-PSC networks. 






      
      
     Shiomoto                Expires April 23, 2007                 [Page 4] 
         
           draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-01 October 2006 
         

        It must be understood that the ultimate objective of migration from 
        MPLS to GMPLS is that all LSRs and the entire network end up running 
        GMPLS protocols. During this process various interim situations may 
        exist giving rise to the interworking situations described in this 
        document. Those interim situations may persist for considerable 
        periods of time, but the ultimate objective is not to preserve these 
        situations, and for the purpose of this document, they should be 
        considered as temporary. 

     4. MPLS to GMPLS Migration Models 

        Three migration models are described below. Multiple migration models 
        may co-exists in the same network. 

     4.1. Island model 

        In the island model, "islands" of network nodes operating one 
        protocol exist within a "sea" of nodes using the other protocol. 

        The most obvious example is to consider an island of GMPLS-capable 
        nodes which is introduced into a legacy MPLS network. Such an island 
        might be composed of newly added GMPLS network nodes, or might arise 
        from the upgrade of existing nodes that previously operated MPLS 
        protocols. The opposite is also quite possible. That is, there is a 
        possibility that an island happens to be MPLS-capable within a GMPLS 
        sea. Such a situation might arise in the later stages of migration, 
        when all but a few islands of MPLS-capable nodes have been upgraded 
        to GMPLS. 

        It is also possible that a lower-layer, manually-provisioned network 
        (for example, a TDM network) supports an MPLS PSC network. During the 
        process of migrating both networks to GMPLS, the lower-layer network 
        might be migrated first. This would appear as a GMPLS island within 
        an MPLS sea. 

        Lastly, it is possible to consider individual nodes as islands. That 
        is, it would be possible to upgrade or insert an individual GMPLS-
        capable node within an MPLS network, and to treat that GMPLS node as 
        an island. 

        Over time, collections of MPLS devices are replaced or upgraded to 
        create new GMPLS islands or to extend existing ones, and distinct 
        GMPLS islands may be joined together until the whole network is 
        GMPLS-capable. 

        From a migration/interworking point of view, we need to examine how 
        these islands are positioned and how LSPs run between the islands. 
      
      
     Shiomoto                Expires April 23, 2007                 [Page 5] 
         
           draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-01 October 2006 
         

        Four categories of interworking scenarios are considered: (1) MPLS-
        GMPLS-MPLS, (2) GMPLS-MPLS-GMPLS, (3) MPLS-GMPLS and (4) GMPLS-MPLS. 
        In case 1 the interworking behavior is examined based on whether the 
        GMPLS islands are PSC or non-PSC. 

        Figure 1 shows an example of the island model for MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS 
        interworking. The model consists of a transit GMPLS island in an MPLS 
        sea. The nodes at the boundary of the GMPLS island (G1, G2, G5, and 
        G6) are referred to as "island border nodes". If the GMPLS island was 
        non-PSC, all nodes except the island border nodes in the GMPLS-based 
        transit island (G3 and G4) would be non-PSC devices, i.e., optical 
        equipment (TDM, LSC, and FSC).

     4.1.1. Balanced Islands 

        In the MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS and GMPLS-MPLS-GMPLS cases, LSPs start and end 
        using the same protocols. Available strategies include: 

        - tunneling the signaling across the island network using LSP 
          nesting or stitching (only with GMPLS-PSC)  

        - protocol interworking or mapping (only with GMPLS-PSC) 

     4.1.2. Unbalanced Islands 

        As just mentioned, there are two island interworking models 
        consisting of abutting islands. GMPLS(PSC)-MPLS and MPLS-GMPLS(PSC) 
        islands cases are likely to arise where the migration strategy is not

        based on a core infrastructure, but has edge nodes (ingress or 
        egress) located in islands of different capabilities. 

        In this case, an LSP starts or ends in a GMPLS (PSC) island and 
        correspondingly ends or starts in an MPLS island. This mode of 
        operation can only be addressed using protocol interworking or 
        mapping. Figure 2 shows the reference model for this migration 
        scenario. Head-end and tail-end LSR are in distinct control plane 
        clouds.

        It is important to underline that this scenario is also impacted by 
        the directionality of the LSP, and the direction in which the LSP is 
        established.  

     4.2. Integrated model 

        The second migration model involves a more integrated migration 
        strategy. New devices that are capable of operating both MPLS and 
        GMPLS protocols are introduced into the MPLS network. 

        In the island model, a GMPLS-capable device does not support the MPLS 
        protocols except border nodes , while in the integrated model there 
        are two types of node present during migration: 

           - those that support MPLS only (legacy nodes) 

           - those that support MPLS and GMPLS. 


      
      
     Shiomoto                Expires April 23, 2007                 [Page 7] 
         
           draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-01 October 2006 
         

        In the island model only island border nodes may support both MPLS 
        and GMPLS while in the integrated model all GMPLS LSRs also support 
        MPLS. 

         

        That is, in integrated model, existing MPLS devices are upgraded to 
        support both MPLS and GMPLS. The network continues to provide MPLS 
        services, and also offers GMPLS services. So, where one end point of 
        a service is a legacy MPLS node, the service is supported using MPLS 
        protocols. Similarly, where the selected path between end points 
        traverses a legacy node that is not GMPLS-capable, MPLS protocols are 
        used. But where the service can be provided using only GMPLS-capable 
        nodes, it may be routed accordingly and can achieve a higher level of 
        functionality by utilizing GMPLS features.  

        Once all devices in the network are GMPLS-capable, the MPLS specific 
        protocol elements may be turned off, and no new devices need to 
        support these elements. 

        In this model, the questions to be addressed concern the co-existence 
        of the two protocol sets within the network. Actual interworking is 
        not a concern. 

     4.3. Phased model 

        The phased model introduces GMPLS features and protocol elements into 
        an MPLS network one by one. For example, some object or sub-object 
        (such as the ERO label sub-object, [RFC3473]) might be introduced 
        into the signaling used by LSRs that are otherwise MPLS-capable. This 
        would produce a kind of hybrid LSR.  

        This approach may appear simpler to implement as one is able to 
        quickly and easily pick up key new functions without needing to 
        upgrade the whole protocol implementation. It is most likely to be 
        used where there is a desire to rapidly implement a particular 
        function within a network without the necessity to install and test 
        the full GMPLS function. 

        Interoperability concerns are exacerbated by this migration model, 
        unless all LSRs in the network are updated simultaneously and there 
        is a clear understanding of which subset of features are to be 
        included in the hybrid LSRs. Interworking between a hybrid LSR and an 
        unchanged MPLS LSR would put the hybrid in the role of a GMPLS LSR as 
        described in the previous sections and puts the hybrid in the role of 
        an MPLS LSR. The potential for different hybrids within the network 
        will complicate matters considerably.

     5. Migration Strategies and Solutions 

        An appropriate migration strategy is selected by a network operator 
        based on factors including the service provider's network deployment 
        plan, customer demand, existing network equipment, operational policy, 
        support from its vendors, etc.  

        For PSC networks, the migration strategy involves the selection 
        between the models described in the previous section. The choice will 
        depend upon the final objective (full GMPLS capability, partial 
        upgrade to include specific GMPLS features, or no change to existing 
        IP/MPLS networks), and upon the immediate objectives (full, phased, 
        or staged upgrade). 

        For PSC networks serviced by non-PSC networks, two basic migration 
        strategies can be considered. In the first strategy, the non-PSC 
        network is made GMPLS-capable first and then the PSC network is 
        migrated to GMPLS. This might arise when, in order to expand the 
        network capacity, GMPLS-based non-PSC sub-networks are introduced 
        into or underneath the legacy MPLS-based networks. Subsequently, the 
        legacy MPLS-based PSC network is migrated to be GMPLS-capable as 
        described in the previous paragraph. Finally the entire network, 
        including both PSC and non-PSC nodes, may be controlled by GMPLS. 

        The second strategy for PSC and non-PSC networks is to migrate from 
        the PSC network to GMPLS first and then enable GMPLS within the non-
        PSC network. The PSC network is migrated as described before, and 
        when the entire PSC network is completely converted to GMPLS, GMPLS-
        based non-PSC devices and networks may be introduced without any 
        issues of interworking between MPLS and GMPLS. 

        These migration strategies and the migration models described in the 
        previous section are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Mixtures of 
        all strategies and models could be applied. The migration models and 
        strategies selected will give rise to one or more of the interworking 
        cases described in the following section. 

     5.1. Solutions Toolkit 

        As described in the previous sections, an essential part of a 
        migration and deployment strategy is how the MPLS and GMPLS or hybrid 
        LSRs interwork. This section sets out some of the alternatives for 
        achieving interworking between MPLS and GMPLS, and points out some of 
        the issues that need to be addressed if the alternatives are adopted. 
        This document does not describe solutions to these issues.

        Note that it is possible to consider upgrading the routing and 
        signaling capabilities of LSRs from MPLS to GMPLS separately.  

     5.1.1. Layered Networks 

        In the balanced island model, LSP tunnels [RFC4206] is a solution to 
        carry the end-to-end LSPs across islands of incompatible nodes. 
        Network layering is often used to separate domains of different data 
        plane technology. It can also be used to separate domains of 
        different control plane technology (such as MPLS and GMPLS protocols), 
        and the solutions developed for multiple data plane technologies can 
        be usefully applied to this situation [RFC3945], [RFC4206], and 
        [INTER-DOM]. [MLN-REQ] gives a discussion of the requirements for 
        multi-layered networks. 

        The GMPLS architecture [RFC3945] identifies three architectural 
        models for supporting multi-layer GMPLS networks, and these models 
        may be applied to the separation of MPLS and GMPLS control plane 
        islands. 

        - In the peer model, both MPLS and GMPLS nodes run the same routing 
          instance, and routing advertisements from within islands of one 
          level of protocol support are distributed to the whole network. 
          This is achievable only as described in section 5.1.2 either by 
          direct distribution or by mapping of parameters. 
           
          Signaling in the peer model may result in contiguous LSPs, 
          stitched LSPs (only for GMPLS PSC), or nested LSPs. If the network 
          islands are non-PSC then the techniques of [MLN] may be applied, 
          and these techniques may be extrapolated to networks where all 
          nodes are PSC, but where there is a difference in signaling 
          protocols. 

        - The overlay model preserves strict separation of routing 
          information between network layers. This is suitable for the 
          balanced island model and there is no requirement to handle 
          routing interworking. Even though the overlay model preserves 
          separation of signaling information between network layers, there 
          may be some interaction in signaling between network layers.  
           
          The overlay model requires the establishment of control plane 
          connectivity for the higher layer across the lower layer. 

        - The augmented model allows limited routing exchange from the lower 
          layer network to the higher layer network. Generally speaking, 
          this assumes that the border nodes provide some form of filtering, 
          mapping or aggregation of routing information advertised from the 
      
      
     Shiomoto                Expires April 23, 2007                [Page 10]

          lower layer network. This architectural model can also be used for 
          balanced island model migrations. Signaling interworking is 
          required as described for the peer model.  

        - The border peer architecture model is defined in [MPLS-OVER-GMPLS]. 
          This is a modification of the augmented model where the layer 
          border routers have visibility into both layers, but no routing 
          information is otherwise exchanged between models. This 
          architectural model is particularly suited to the MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS 
          island model for PSC and non-PSC GMPLS islands.  Signaling 
          interworking is required as described for the peer model.  

         

     5.1.2. Routing Interworking 

        Migration strategies may necessitate some interworking between MPLS 
        and GMPLS routing protocols. GMPLS extends the TE information 
        advertised by the IGPs to include non-PSC information and extended 
        PSC information. Because the GMPLS information is provided as 
        additional TLVs that are carried along with the MPLS information, 
        MPLS LSRs are able to "see" all GMPLS LSRs as though they were MPLS 
        PSC LSRs. They will also see other GMPLS information, but will ignore 
        it, flooding it transparently across the MPLS network for use by 
        other GMPLS LSRs. 

        - Routing separation is achieved in the overlay, and border peer 
          models. This is convenient since only the border nodes need to be 
          aware of the different protocol variants, and no mapping is 
          required. It is suitable to the MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS and GMPLS-MPLS-
          GMPLS island migration models. 

        - Direct distribution involves the flooding of MPLS routing 
          information into a GMPLS network, and GMPLS routing information 
          into an MPLS network. The border nodes make no attempt to filter 
          the information. This mode of operation relies on the fact that 
          MPLS routers will ignore, but continue to flood, GMPLS routing 
          information that they do not understand. The presence of 
          additional GMPLS routing information will not interfere with the 
          way that MPLS LSRs select routes, and although this is not a 
          problem in a PSC-only network, it could cause problems in a peer 
          architecture network that includes non-PSC nodes as the MPLS nodes 
          are not capable of determining the switching types of the other 
          LSRs and will attempt to signal end-to-end LSPs assuming all LSRs 
          to be PSC. This fact would require island border nodes to take 
          triggered action to set up tunnels across islands of different 
          switching capabilities.

           draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-01 October 2006 
         

           
          GMPLS LSRs might be impacted by the absence of GMPLS-specific 
          information in advertisements initiated by MPLS LSRs. Specific 
          procedures might be required to ensure consistent behavior by 
          GMPLS nodes. If this issue is addressed, then direct distribution 
          can be used in all migration models (except the overlay and border 
          peer architectural models where the problem does not arise). 

        - Protocol mapping converts routing advertisements so that they can 
          be received in one protocol and transmitted in the other. For 
          example, a GMPLS routing advertisement could have all of its 
          GMPLS-specific information removed and could be flooded as an MPLS 
          advertisement. This mode of interworking would require careful 
          standardization of the correct behavior especially where an MPLS 
          advertisement requires default values of GMPLS-specific fields to 
          be generated before the advertisement can be flooded further. 
          There is also considerable risk of confusion in closely meshed 
          networks where many LSRs have MPLS and GMPLS capable interfaces. 
          This option for routing interworking during migration is NOT 
          RECOMMENDED for any migration model. 

        - Ships in the night refers to a mode of operation where both MPLS 
          and GMPLS routing protocol variants are operated in the same 
          network at the same time as separate routing protocol instances. 
          The two instances are independent and are used to create routing 
          adjacencies between LSRs of the same type. This mode of operation 
          may be appropriate to the integrated migration model. 

     5.1.3. Signaling Interworking 

        Signaling protocols are used to establish LSPs and are the principal 
        concern for interworking during migration. Issues of compatibility 
        arise because of simple changes in the encodings and codepoints used 
        by MPLS and GMPLS signaling, but also because of changes in function 
        levels provided by MPLS and GMPLS. 

        - Tunneling and stitching (GMPLS-PSC case) mechanisms are a good way 
          to avoid any requirement for direct protocol interworking during 
          migration in the island model because protocol elements are 
          transported transparently across migration islands without being 
          inspected. However, care may be needed to achieve functional 
          mapping in these modes of operation since one set of features must 
          be carried across a network designed to support a different set of 
          features. In general, this is easily achieved for the MPLS-GMPLS-
          MPLS model, but may be hard to achieve in the GMPLS-MPLS-GMPLS 
          model for example, when end-to-end bidirectional LSPs are 
          requested since the MPLS island does not support bidirectional 
      
      
     Shiomoto                Expires April 23, 2007                [Page 12] 
         
           draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-01 October 2006 
         

          LSPs. 
           
          Note that tunneling and stitching are not available in unbalanced 
          island models because in these cases the LSP end points use 
          different protocol variants. 

        - Protocol mapping is the conversion of signaling messages between 
          MPLS and GMPLS variants. This mechanism requires careful 
          documentation of the protocol fields and how they are mapped, but 
          is relatively simple in the MPLS-GMPLS unbalanced island model. 
          However, the MPLS-GMPLS island model may manifest as the GMPLS-
          MPLS model for LSPs signaled in the opposite direction and this 
          will lead to considerable complications for providing GMPLS 
          services over the MPLS island and for terminating those services 
          at an egress LSR that is not GMPLS-capable. Further, in balanced 
          island models, and in particular where there are multiple small 
          (individual node) islands, the repeated conversion of signaling 
          parameters may lead to loss of information or mis-requests.  

        - Ships in the night could be used in the integrated migration model 
          to allow MPLS-capable LSRs to establish LSPs using MPLS signaling 
          protocols and GMPLS LSRs to establish LSPs using GMPLS signaling 
          protocols. LSRs that can handle both sets of protocols could play 
          a part in either case, but no conversion of protocols would be 
          applied.  

         

     6.  Manageability Considerations 

        Attention should be given during migration planning to how the 
        network will be managed during and after migration. For example, will 
        the LSRs of different protocol capabilities be managed separately or 
        as a whole. This is most clear in the Island Model where it is 
        possible to consider managing islands of one capability separately 
        from the surrounding sea. In the case of islands that have different 
        switching capabilities, it is possible that the islands already had 
        different management in place before the migration: the resultant 
        migrated network may seek to merge the management or to preserve it. 

     6.1. Control of Function and Policy 

        The most important control to be applied is at the moment of 
        changeover between different levels of protocol support. Such a 
        change may be made dynamically or during a period of network 
        maintenance. 

      
      
     Shiomoto                Expires April 23, 2007                [Page 13] 
         
           draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-01 October 2006 
         

        Where island boundaries exist, it must be possible to manage the 
        relationships between protocols and to indicate which interfaces 
        support which protocols on a border LSR. Further, island borders are 
        a natural place to apply policy, and management should allow 
        configuration of such policies. 

     6.2. Information and Data Models 

        No special information or data models are required to support 
        migration, but note that migration in the control plane implies 
        migration from MPLS management tools to GMPLS management tools. 
        During migration, therefore, it may be necessary for LSRs and 
        management applications to support both MPLS and GMPLS variants of 
        management data. 

        The GMPLS MIB modules are designed to allow support of the MPLS 
        protocols and build on the MPLS MIB modules through extensions and 
        augmentations. This may make it possible to migrate management 
        applications ahead of the LSRs that they manage. 

     6.3. Liveness Detection and Monitoring 

        Migration will not imposes additional issues for OAM above those that 
        already exist for inter-domain OAM and for OAM across multiple 
        switching capabilities. 

        Note, however, that if a flat PSC MPLS network is migrated using the 
        island model, and is treated as a layered network using tunnels to 
        connect across GMPLS islands, then requirements for a multi-layer OAM 
        technique may be introduced into what was previously defined in the 
        flat OAM problem-space. The OAM framework of MPLS/GMPLS interworking 
        may be described in more detail in a later version. 

     6.4. Verifying Correct Operation 

        The concerns for verifying correct operation (and in particular 
        correct connectivity) are the same as for liveness detection and 
        monitoring. Principally, the process of migration may introduce 
        tunneling or stitching into what was previously a flat network. 

     6.5. Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components 

        No particular requirements are introduced on other protocols. As it 
        has been observed, the management components may need to migrate in 
        step with the control plane components, but this does not impact the 
        management protocols, just the data that they carry. 

      
      
     Shiomoto                Expires April 23, 2007                [Page 14] 
         
           draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-01 October 2006 
         

        It should also be observed that providing signaling and routing 
        connectivity across a migration island in support of a layered 
        architecture may require the use of protocol tunnels (such as GRE) 
        between island border nodes. Such tunnels may impose additional 
        configuration requirements at the border nodes. 

     6.6. Impact on Network Operation 

        The process of migration is likely to have significant impact on 
        network operation while migration is in progress. The main objective 
        of migration planning should be to reduce the impact on network 
        operation and on the services perceived by the network users.  

        To this end, planners should consider reducing the number of 
        migration steps that they perform, and minimizing the number of 
        migration islands that are created. 

        A network manager may prefer the island model especially when 
        migration will extend over a significant operational period because 
        it allows the different network islands to be administered as 
        separate management domains. This is particularly the case in the 
        overlay and augmented network models where the details of the 
        protocol islands remain hidden from the surrounding LSRs. 

     6.7. Other Considerations 

        A migration strategy may also imply moving an MPLS state to a GMPLS 
        state for an in-service LSP. This may arise once all of the LSRs 
        along the path of the LSP have been updated to be both MPLS and 
        GMPLS-capable. Signaling mechanisms to achieve the replacement of an 
        MPLS LSP with a GMPLS LSP without disrupting traffic exist through 
        make-before-break procedures [RFC3209] and [RFC3473], and should be 
        carefully managed under operator control. 

         

     7. Security Considerations 

        Security and confidentiality is often applied (and attacked) at 
        administrative boundaries. Some of the models described in this 
        document introduce such boundaries, for example between MPLS and 
        GMPLS islands. These boundaries offer the possibility of applying or 
        modifying the security as one might when crossing an IGP area or AS 
        boundary, even though these island boundaries might lie within an IGP 
        area or AS. 


      
      
     Shiomoto                Expires April 23, 2007                [Page 15] 
         
           draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-01 October 2006 
         

        No changes are proposed to the security procedures built into MPLS 
        and GMPLS signaling and routing. GMPLS signaling and routing inherit 
        their security mechanisms from MPLS signaling and routing without any 
        changes. Hence, there will be no issues with security in interworking 
        scenarios. Further, since the MPLS and GMPLS signaling and routing 
        security is provided on a hop-by-hop basis, and since all signaling 
        and routing exchanges described in this document for use between any 
        pair of LSRs are based on either MPLS or GMPLS, there are no changes 
        necessary to the security procedures.
