Abstract

   To support IP multicasting in PMIPv6 domain, [I-D.ietf-multimob-
   pmipv6-base-solution] has been submitted as a base solution that
   locates MR on the LMA and uses the PMIPv6 tunnel between LMA and MAG
   for MLD messages. In this draft, we present the direct routing
   solution that uses the direct connection between MAG and MR, and
   locates the MLD forwarding proxy function on MAGs. The proposed
   direct routing solution is compared with the base deployment
   solution.

Internet-Draft    Mobile Multicasting Support in PMIPv6       March 2010


1. Introduction

   To support multicasting service in PMIPv6 domain, it is required to
   determine which multicasting function should be placed on which
   PMIPv6 component. From such a point of view, mobile multicasting
   solutions could be classified into two categories: a MR co-located
   LMA approach and a MR separated LMA approach. In the former case, the
   MR function is placed on LMA and the IGMP/MLD forwarding proxy
   function [RFC4605] is located on MAG. The MR co-located LMA approach
   is proposed a base solution [I-D.ietf-multimob-pmipv6-base-solution]
   without any modifications of [RFC5213]. But it introduces the tunnel
   convergence problem that a MAG may receive same multicast packets
   from several LMAs, which leads to waste of network bandwidth usage.
   In this draft, we propose a MR separated LMA approach without any
   load on LMA, which allows MAGs to receive multicast packets directly
   from MRs. So, it has not tunnel convergence problem and reduces the
   complexity on the LMA. Moreover, this solution could be also used in
   the environment that is not applied with PMIPv6 protocol.

          Figure 1. Direct Routing Solution for PMIPv6 Multicasting

   Figure 1 shows the proposed mobile multicasting solution for Proxy
   Mobile IPv6. There is no multicast routing function on the LMA. We
   call it the direct routing solution based on local routing scenario
   described in [I-D.deng-multimob-pmip6-requirement]. This solution has
   not tunnel convergence issue caused by a MAG receives the same
   multicast packets from several LMAs. To forward IGMP/MLD signaling
   and multicast packets, a MAG needs only the MLD forwarding proxy
   function defined in [RFC4605]. This solution is more simple than the
   base deployment solution and easy to deploy because LMAs are
   separated from multicast operation.

   When an MN hands off to the N-MAG from the P-MAG, the N-MAG detects

   the newly arrived MN and transmits an MLD Query message to the MN.
   After receiving the MLD Query message, the MN sends an MLD Report
   message that includes the multicast group information. The N-MAG then
   sends an aggregated MLD Report message to the MR. When the N-MAG
   receives the multicast packets from the MR, it then simply forwards
   them without tunnel encapsulation. The N-MAG needs to update the MN's
   location information to the LMA by exchanging PBU/PBA signaling
   messages.


4. Comparison with Base Deployment Solution and Direct Routing Solution

   In this section, we compare the direct routing solution with the base
   deployment solution [I-D.ietf-multimob-pmipv6-base-solution] in terms
   of performance, easiness in deployment and others.

4.1. Tunnel Convergence Problem

   In the base deployment solution, the MR function is combined with
   LMA. Thus, all the packets are delivered to MNs through PMIPv6 tunnel
   between MAG and LMA, which raises the tunnel convergence problem
   because a MAG may receive the same multicast packets from several
   LMAs. The proposed direct routing solution does not introduce tunnel
   convergence problem because a MAG is directly connected to only one
   MR.

4.2. Complexity in LMA

   In the base deployment solution, the MR function is combined with LMA
   that should process the MLD messages and perform the join/leave
   procedure with other multicast routers accordingly. The complexity
   will increase as the number of multicast channels increases.


4.3. Other Advantage

   When we consider the MN's handover case from PMIPv6 domains to non-
   PMIPv6 domains as described in [I-D.von-hugo-multimob-future-work],
   we could also use the direct routing solution because it does not
   depend on PMIPv6 tunnel for multicasting operation.

7. Security Considerations

   This document does not discuss any special security concerns in
