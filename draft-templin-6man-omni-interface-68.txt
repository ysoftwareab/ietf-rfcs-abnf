    Transmission of IP Packets over Overlay Multilink Network (OMNI)
                               Interfaces
                  draft-templin-6man-omni-interface-68

Abstract

   Mobile nodes (e.g., aircraft of various configurations, terrestrial
   vehicles, seagoing vessels, enterprise wireless devices, etc.)
   communicate with networked correspondents over multiple access
   network data links and configure mobile routers to connect end user
   networks.  A multilink interface specification is therefore needed
   for coordination with the network-based mobility service.  This
   document specifies the transmission of IP packets over Overlay
   Multilink Network (OMNI) Interfaces.

1.  Introduction

   Mobile Nodes (MNs) (e.g., aircraft of various configurations,
   terrestrial vehicles, seagoing vessels, enterprise wireless devices,
   pedestrians with cellphones, etc.) often have multiple interface
   connections to wireless and/or wired-link data links used for
   communicating with networked correspondents.  These data links may
   have diverse performance, cost and availability properties that can
   change dynamically according to mobility patterns, flight phases,
   proximity to infrastructure, etc.  MNs coordinate their data links in
   a discipline known as "multilink", in which a single virtual
   interface is configured over the node's underlying interface
   connections to the data links.

   The MN configures a virtual interface (termed the "Overlay Multilink
   Network (OMNI) interface") as a thin layer over the underlying
   interfaces.  The OMNI interface is therefore the only interface
   abstraction exposed to the IP layer and behaves according to the Non-
   Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA) interface principle, while
   underlying interfaces appear as link layer communication channels in
   the architecture.  The OMNI interface connects to a virtual overlay
   service known as the "OMNI link".  The OMNI link spans one or more
   Internetworks that may include private-use infrastructures and/or the
   global public Internet itself.

   Each MN receives a Mobile Network Prefix (MNP) for numbering
   downstream-attached End User Networks (EUNs) independently of the
   access network data links selected for data transport.  The MN
   performs router discovery over the OMNI interface (i.e., similar to
   IPv6 customer edge routers [RFC7084]) and acts as a mobile router on
   behalf of its EUNs.  The router discovery process is iterated over
   each of the OMNI interface's underlying interfaces in order to
   register per-link parameters (see Section 13).

   The OMNI interface provides a multilink nexus for exchanging inbound
   and outbound traffic via the correct underlying interface(s).  The IP
   layer sees the OMNI interface as a point of connection to the OMNI
   link.  Each OMNI link has one or more associated Mobility Service



Templin & Whyman          Expires July 5, 2021                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   Prefixes (MSPs), which are typically IP Global Unicast Address (GUA)
   prefixes from which OMNI link MNPs are derived.  If there are
   multiple OMNI links, the IPv6 layer will see multiple OMNI
   interfaces.

   MNs may connect to multiple distinct OMNI links by configuring
   multiple OMNI interfaces, e.g., omni0, omni1, omni2, etc.  Each OMNI
   interface is configured over a set of underlying interfaces and
   provides a nexus for Safety-Based Multilink (SBM) operation.  Each
   OMNI SBM "domain" configures a common ULA prefix [ULA]::/48, and each
   OMNI link within the domain configures a unique 16-bit Subnet ID '*'
   to construct the sub-prefix [ULA*]::/64 (see: Section 8).  The IP
   layer applies SBM routing to select an OMNI interface, which then
   applies Performance-Based Multilink (PBM) to select the correct
   underlying interface.  Applications can apply Segment Routing
   [RFC8402] to select independent SBM topologies for fault tolerance.

   The OMNI interface interacts with a network-based Mobility Service
   (MS) through IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) control message exchanges
   [RFC4861].  The MS provides Mobility Service Endpoints (MSEs) that
   track MN movements and represent their MNPs in a global routing or
   mapping system.

   Many OMNI use cases are currently under active consideration.  In
   particular, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
   Working Group-I Mobility Subgroup is developing a future Aeronautical
   Telecommunications Network with Internet Protocol Services (ATN/IPS)
   and has issued a liaison statement requesting IETF adoption [ATN] in
   support of ICAO Document 9896 [ATN-IPS].  The IETF IP Wireless Access
   in Vehicular Environments (ipwave) working group has further included
   problem statement and use case analysis for OMNI in a document now in
   AD evaluation for RFC publication
   [I-D.ietf-ipwave-vehicular-networking].  Still other communities of
   interest include AEEC, RTCA Special Committee 228 (SC-228) and NASA
   programs that examine commercial aviation, Urban Air Mobility (UAM)
   and Unmanned Air Systems (UAS).  Pedestrians with handheld devices
   represent another large class of potential OMNI users.

   This document specifies the transmission of IP packets and MN/MS
   control messages over OMNI interfaces.  The OMNI interface supports
   either IP protocol version (i.e., IPv4 [RFC0791] or IPv6 [RFC8200])
   as the network layer in the data plane, while using IPv6 ND messaging
   as the control plane independently of the data plane IP protocol(s).
   The OMNI Adaptation Layer (OAL) which operates as a mid-layer between
   L3 and L2 is based on IP-in-IPv6 encapsulation per [RFC2473] as
   discussed in the following sections.

2.  Terminology

   The terminology in the normative references applies; especially, the
   terms "link" and "interface" are the same as defined in the IPv6
   [RFC8200] and IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) [RFC4861] specifications.
   Additionally, this document assumes the following IPv6 ND message
   types: Router Solicitation (RS), Router Advertisement (RA), Neighbor
   Solicitation (NS), Neighbor Advertisement (NA) and Redirect.

   The Protocol Constants defined in Section 10 of [RFC4861] are used in
   their same format and meaning in this document.  The terms "All-
   Routers multicast", "All-Nodes multicast" and "Subnet-Router anycast"
   are the same as defined in [RFC4291] (with Link-Local scope assumed).

   The term "IP" is used to refer collectively to either Internet
   Protocol version (i.e., IPv4 [RFC0791] or IPv6 [RFC8200]) when a
   specification at the layer in question applies equally to either
   version.

   The following terms are defined within the scope of this document:

   Mobile Node (MN)
      an end system with a mobile router having multiple distinct
      upstream data link connections that are grouped together in one or
      more logical units.  The MN's data link connection parameters can
      change over time due to, e.g., node mobility, link quality, etc.
      The MN further connects a downstream-attached End User Network
      (EUN).  The term MN used here is distinct from uses in other
      documents, and does not imply a particular mobility protocol.

   End User Network (EUN)
      a simple or complex downstream-attached mobile network that
      travels with the MN as a single logical unit.  The IP addresses
      assigned to EUN devices remain stable even if the MN's upstream
      data link connections change.

   Mobility Service (MS)
      a mobile routing service that tracks MN movements and ensures that
      MNs remain continuously reachable even across mobility events.
      Specific MS details are out of scope for this document.

   Mobility Service Endpoint (MSE)
      an entity in the MS (either singular or aggregate) that
      coordinates the mobility events of one or more MN.

   Mobility Service Prefix (MSP)
      an aggregated IP Global Unicast Address (GUA) prefix (e.g.,
      2001:db8::/32, 192.0.2.0/24, etc.) assigned to the OMNI link and



Templin & Whyman          Expires July 5, 2021                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


      from which more-specific Mobile Network Prefixes (MNPs) are
      delegated.  OMNI link administrators typically obtain MSPs from an
      Internet address registry, however private-use prefixes can
      alternatively be used subject to certain limitations (see:
      Section 9).  OMNI links that connect to the global Internet
      advertise their MSPs to their interdomain routing peers.

   Mobile Network Prefix (MNP)
      a longer IP prefix delegated from an MSP (e.g.,
      2001:db8:1000:2000::/56, 192.0.2.8/30, etc.) and assigned to a MN.
      MNs sub-delegate the MNP to devices located in EUNs.

   Access Network (ANET)
      a data link service network (e.g., an aviation radio access
      network, satellite service provider network, cellular operator
      network, wifi network, etc.) that connects MNs.  Physical and/or
      data link level security is assumed, and sometimes referred to as
      "protected spectrum".  Private enterprise networks and ground
      domain aviation service networks may provide multiple secured IP
      hops between the MN's point of connection and the nearest Access
      Router.

   Access Router (AR)
      a router in the ANET for connecting MNs to correspondents in
      outside Internetworks.  The AR may be located on the same physical
      link as the MN, or may be located multiple IP hops away.  In the
      latter case, the MN uses encapsulation to communicate with the AR
      as though it were on the same physical link.

   ANET interface
      a MN's attachment to a link in an ANET.

   Internetwork (INET)
      a connected network region with a coherent IP addressing plan that
      provides transit forwarding services between ANETs and nodes that
      connect directly to the open INET via unprotected media.  No
      physical and/or data link level security is assumed, therefore
      security must be applied by upper layers.  The global public
      Internet itself is an example.

   INET interface
      a node's attachment to a link in an INET.

   *NET
      a "wildcard" term used when a given specification applies equally
      to both ANET and INET cases.

   OMNI link

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


      a Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA) virtual overlay configured
      over one or more INETs and their connected ANETs.  An OMNI link
      can comprise multiple INET segments joined by bridges the same as
      for any link; the addressing plans in each segment may be mutually
      exclusive and managed by different administrative entities.

   OMNI interface
      a node's attachment to an OMNI link, and configured over one or
      more underlying *NET interfaces.  If there are multiple OMNI links
      in an OMNI domain, a separate OMNI interface is configured for
      each link.

   OMNI Adaptation Layer (OAL)
      an OMNI interface process whereby packets admitted into the
      interface are wrapped in a mid-layer IPv6 header and fragmented/
      reassembled if necessary to support the OMNI link Maximum
      Transmission Unit (MTU).  The OAL is also responsible for
      generating MTU-related control messages as necessary, and for
      providing addressing context for spanning multiple segments of a
      bridged OMNI link.

   OMNI Option
      an IPv6 Neighbor Discovery option providing multilink parameters
      for the OMNI interface as specified in Section 10.

   Mobile Network Prefix Link Local Address (MNP-LLA)
      an IPv6 Link Local Address that embeds the most significant 64
      bits of an MNP in the lower 64 bits of fe80::/64, as specified in
      Section 7.

   Mobile Network Prefix Unique Local Address (MNP-ULA)
      an IPv6 Unique-Local Address derived from an MNP-LLA.

   Administrative Link Local Address (ADM-LLA)
      an IPv6 Link Local Address that embeds a 32-bit administratively-
      assigned identification value in the lower 32 bits of fe80::/96,
      as specified in Section 7.

   Administrative Unique Local Address (ADM-ULA)
      an IPv6 Unique-Local Address derived from an ADM-LLA.

   Multilink
      an OMNI interface's manner of managing diverse underlying
      interface connections to data links as a single logical unit.  The
      OMNI interface provides a single unified interface to upper
      layers, while underlying interface selections are performed on a
      per-packet basis considering factors such as DSCP, flow label,
      application policy, signal quality, cost, etc.  Multilinking

      decisions are coordinated in both the outbound (i.e.  MN to
      correspondent) and inbound (i.e., correspondent to MN) directions.

   L2
      The second layer in the OSI network model.  Also known as "layer-
      2", "link-layer", "sub-IP layer", "data link layer", etc.

   L3
      The third layer in the OSI network model.  Also known as "layer-
      3", "network-layer", "IP layer", etc.

   underlying interface
      a *NET interface over which an OMNI interface is configured.  The
      OMNI interface is seen as a L3 interface by the IP layer, and each
      underlying interface is seen as a L2 interface by the OMNI
      interface.  The underlying interface either connects directly to
      the physical communications media or coordinates with another node
      where the physical media is hosted.

   Mobility Service Identification (MSID)
      Each MSE and AR is assigned a unique 32-bit Identification (MSID)
      (see: Section 7).  IDs are assigned according to MS-specific
      guidelines (e.g., see: [I-D.templin-intarea-6706bis]).

   Safety-Based Multilink (SBM)
      A means for ensuring fault tolerance through redundancy by
      connecting multiple affiliated OMNI interfaces to independent
      routing topologies (i.e., multiple independent OMNI links).

   Performance Based Multilink (PBM)
      A means for selecting underlying interface(s) for packet
      transmission and reception within a single OMNI interface.

   OMNI Domain
      The set of all SBM/PBM OMNI links that collectively provides
      services for a common set of MSPs.  Each OMNI domain consists of a
      set of affiliated OMNI links that all configure the same ::/48 ULA
      prefix with a unique 16-bit Subnet ID as discussed in Section 8.

3.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   OMNI links maintain a constant value "MAX_MSID" selected to provide
   MNs with an acceptable level of MSE redundancy while minimizing
   control message amplification.  It is RECOMMENDED that MAX_MSID be
   set to the default value 5; if a different value is chosen, it should
   be set uniformly by all nodes on the OMNI link.

   An implementation is not required to internally use the architectural
   constructs described here so long as its external behavior is
   consistent with that described in this document.

4.  Overlay Multilink Network (OMNI) Interface Model

   An OMNI interface is a MN virtual interface configured over one or
   more underlying interfaces, which may be physical (e.g., an
   aeronautical radio link) or virtual (e.g., an Internet or higher-
   layer "tunnel").  The MN receives a MNP from the MS, and coordinates
   with the MS through IPv6 ND message exchanges.  The MN uses the MNP
   to construct a unique Link-Local Address (MNP-LLA) through the
   algorithmic derivation specified in Section 7 and assigns the LLA to
   the OMNI interface.

   The OMNI interface architectural layering model is the same as in
   [RFC5558][RFC7847], and augmented as shown in Figure 1.  The IP layer
   therefore sees the OMNI interface as a single L3 interface with
   multiple underlying interfaces that appear as L2 communication
   channels in the architecture.

           Figure 1: OMNI Interface Architectural Layering Model

   Each underlying interface provides an L2/L1 abstraction according to
   one of the following models:

   o  INET interfaces connect to an INET either natively or through one
      or several IPv4 Network Address Translators (NATs).  Native INET
      interfaces have global IP addresses that are reachable from any
      INET correspondent.  NATed INET interfaces typically have private
      IP addresses and connect to a private network behind one or more
      NATs that provide INET access.

   o  ANET interfaces connect to a protected ANET that is separated from
      the open INET by an AR acting as a proxy.  The ANET interface may
      be either on the same L2 link segment as the AR, or separated from
      the AR by multiple IP hops.

   o  VPNed interfaces use security encapsulation over a *NET to a
      Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateway.  Other than the link-layer
      encapsulation format, VPNed interfaces behave the same as for
      Direct interfaces.

   o  Direct (aka "point-to-point") interfaces connect directly to a
      peer without crossing any *NET paths.  An example is a line-of-
      sight link between a remote pilot and an unmanned aircraft.

   The OMNI virtual interface model gives rise to a number of
   opportunities:

   o  since MNP-LLAs are uniquely derived from an MNP, no Duplicate
      Address Detection (DAD) or Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD)
      messaging is necessary.

   o  since Temporary LLAs are statistically unique, they can be used
      without DAD for short-term purposes, e.g. until an MNP-LLA is
      obtained.

   o  *NET interfaces on the same L2 link segment as an AR do not
      require any L3 addresses (i.e., not even link-local) in
      environments where communications are coordinated entirely over
      the OMNI interface.  (An alternative would be to also assign the
      same LLA to all *NET interfaces.)

   o  as underlying interface properties change (e.g., link quality,
      cost, availability, etc.), any active interface can be used to
      update the profiles of multiple additional interfaces in a single
      message.  This allows for timely adaptation and service continuity
      under dynamically changing conditions.

   o  coordinating underlying interfaces in this way allows them to be
      represented in a unified MS profile with provisions for mobility
      and multilink operations.

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   o  exposing a single virtual interface abstraction to the IPv6 layer
      allows for multilink operation (including QoS based link
      selection, packet replication, load balancing, etc.) at L2 while
      still permitting L3 traffic shaping based on, e.g., DSCP, flow
      label, etc.

   o  the OMNI interface allows inter-INET traversal when nodes located
      in different INETs need to communicate with one another.  This
      mode of operation would not be possible via direct communications
      over the underlying interfaces themselves.

   o  the OMNI Adaptation Layer (OAL) within the OMNI interface supports
      lossless and adaptive path MTU mitigations not available for
      communications directly over the underlying interfaces themselves.

   o  L3 sees the OMNI interface as a point of connection to the OMNI
      link; if there are multiple OMNI links (i.e., multiple MS's), L3
      will see multiple OMNI interfaces.

   o  Multiple independent OMNI interfaces can be used for increased
      fault tolerance through Safety-Based Multilink (SBM), with
      Performance-Based Multilink (PBM) applied within each interface.

   Other opportunities are discussed in [RFC7847].  Note that even when
   the OMNI virtual interface is present, applications can still access
   underlying interfaces either through the network protocol stack using
   an Internet socket or directly using a raw socket.  This allows for
   intra-network (or point-to-point) communications without invoking the
   OMNI interface and/or OAL.  For example, when an IPv6 OMNI interface
   is configured over an underlying IPv4 interface, applications can
   still invoke IPv4 intra-network communications as long as the
   communicating endpoints are not subject to mobility dynamics.
   However, the opportunities discussed above are not available when the
   architectural layering is bypassed in this way.

   Figure 2 depicts the architectural model for a MN with an attached
   EUN connecting to the MS via multiple independent *NETs.  When an
   underlying interface becomes active, the MN's OMNI interface sends
   IPv6 ND messages without encapsulation if the first-hop Access Router
   (AR) is on the same underlying link; otherwise, the interface uses
   IP-in-IP encapsulation.  The IPv6 ND messages traverse the ground
   domain *NETs until they reach an AR (AR#1, AR#2, ..., AR#n), which
   then coordinates with an INET Mobility Service Endpoint (MSE#1,
   MSE#2, ..., MSE#m) and returns an IPv6 ND message response to the MN.
   The Hop Limit in IPv6 ND messages is not decremented due to
   encapsulation; hence, the OMNI interface appears to be attached to an
   ordinary link.

              Figure 2: MN/MS Coordination via Multiple *NETs

   After the initial IPv6 ND message exchange, the MN (and/or any nodes
   on its attached EUNs) can send and receive IP data packets over the
   OMNI interface.  OMNI interface multilink services will forward the
   packets via ARs in the correct underlying *NETs.  The AR encapsulates
   the packets according to the capabilities provided by the MS and
   forwards them to the next hop within the worldwide connected
   Internetwork via optimal routes.

   OMNI links span one or more underlying Internetwork via the OMNI
   Adaptation Layer (OAL) which is based on a mid-layer overlay
   encapsulation using [RFC2473].  Each OMNI link corresponds to a
   different overlay (differentiated by an address codepoint) which may

   be carried over a completely separate underlying topology.  Each MN
   can facilitate SBM by connecting to multiple OMNI links using a
   distinct OMNI interface for each link.

   Note: OMNI interface underlying interfaces often connect directly to
   physical media on the local platform (e.g., a laptop computer with
   WiFi, etc.), but in some configurations the physical media may be
   hosted on a separate Local Area Network (LAN) node.  In that case,
   the OMNI interface can establish a Layer-2 VLAN or a point-to-point
   tunnel (at a layer below the underlying interface) to the node
   hosting the physical media.  The OMNI interface may also apply
   encapsulation at a layer above the underlying interface such that
   packets would appear "double-encapsulated" on the LAN; the node
   hosting the physical media in turn removes the LAN encapsulation
   prior to transmission or inserts it following reception.  Finally,
   the underlying interface must monitor the node hosting the physical
   media (e.g., through periodic keepalives) so that it can convey
   up/down/status information to the OMNI interface.

5.  The OMNI Adaptation Layer (OAL)

   The OMNI interface observes the link nature of tunnels, including the
   Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU), Maximum Reassembly Unit (MRU) and
   the role of fragmentation and reassembly [I-D.ietf-intarea-tunnels].
   The OMNI interface is configured over one or more underlying
   interfaces that may have diverse MTUs.  OMNI interfaces accommodate
   MTU diversity through the use of the OMNI Adaptation Layer (OAL) as
   discussed in this section.

   IPv6 underlying interfaces are REQUIRED to configure a minimum MTU of
   1280 bytes and a minimum MRU of 1500 bytes [RFC8200].  Therefore, the
   minimum IPv6 path MTU is 1280 bytes since routers on the path are not
   permitted to perform network fragmentation even though the
   destination is required to reassemble more.  The network therefore
   MUST forward packets of at least 1280 bytes without generating an
   IPv6 Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) Packet Too Big (PTB) message
   [RFC8201].  (Note: the source can apply "source fragmentation" for
   locally-generated IPv6 packets up to 1500 bytes and larger still if
   it if has a way to determine that the destination configures a larger
   MRU, but this does not affect the minimum IPv6 path MTU.)

   IPv4 underlying interfaces are REQUIRED to configure a minimum MTU of
   68 bytes [RFC0791] and a minimum MRU of 576 bytes [RFC0791][RFC1122].
   Therefore, when the Don't Fragment (DF) bit in the IPv4 header is set
   to 0 the minimum IPv4 path MTU is 576 bytes since routers on the path
   support network fragmentation and the destination is required to
   reassemble at least that much.  The "Don't Fragment" (DF) bit in the
   IPv4 encapsulation headers of packets sent over IPv4 underlying



Templin & Whyman          Expires July 5, 2021                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   interfaces therefore MUST be set to 0.  (Note: even if the
   encapsulation source has a way to determine that the encapsulation
   destination configures an MRU larger than 576 bytes, it should not
   assume a larger minimum IPv4 path MTU without careful consideration
   of the issues discussed in Section 5.1.)

   In network paths where IPv6/IPv4 protocol translation or IPv6-in-IPv4
   encapsulation may be prevalent, it may be prudent for the OAL to
   always assume the IPv4 minimum path MTU (i.e., 576 bytes) regardless
   of the underlying interface IP protocol version.  Always assuming the
   IPv4 minimum path MTU even for IPv6 underlying interfaces may produce
   more fragments and additional header overhead, but will always
   interoperate and never run the risk of presenting an IPv4 interface
   with a packet that exceeds its MRU.

   The OMNI interface configures both an MTU and MRU of 9180 bytes
   [RFC2492]; the size is therefore not a reflection of the underlying
   interface MTUs, but rather determines the largest packet the OMNI
   interface can forward or reassemble.  The OMNI interface uses the
   OMNI Adaptation Layer (OAL) to admit packets from the network layer
   that are no larger than the OMNI interface MTU while generating
   ICMPv4 Fragmentation Needed [RFC1191] or ICMPv6 Path MTU Discovery
   (PMTUD) Packet Too Big (PTB) [RFC8201] messages as necessary.  This
   document refers to both of these ICMPv4/ICMPv6 message types simply
   as "PTBs", and introduces a distinction between PTB "hard" and "soft"
   errors as discussed below.

   For IPv4 packets with DF=0, the network layer performs IPv4
   fragmentation if necessary then admits the packets/fragments into the
   OMNI interface; these fragments will be reassembled by the final
   destination.  For IPv4 packets with DF=1 and IPv6 packets, the
   network layer admits the packet if it is no larger than the OMNI
   interface MTU; otherwise, it drops the packet and returns a PTB hard
   error message to the source.

   For each admitted IP packet/fragment, the OMNI interface internally
   employs the OAL when necessary by encapsulating the inner IP packet/
   fragment in a mid-layer IPv6 header per [RFC2473] before adding any
   outer IP encapsulations.  (The OAL does not decrement the inner IP
   Hop Limit/TTL during encapsulation since the insertion occurs at a
   layer below IP forwarding.)  The OAL then calculates the 32-bit CRC
   over the entire mid-layer packet and writes the value in a trailing
   4-octet field at the end of the packet.  Next, the OAL fragments this
   mid-layer IPv6 packet, forwards the fragments (using *NET
   encapsulation if necessary), and returns an internally-generated PTB
   soft error message (subject to rate limiting) if it deems the packet
   too large according to factors such as link performance
   characteristics, reassembly congestion, etc.  This ensures that the

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   path MTU is adaptive and reflects the current path used for a given
   data flow.

   The OAL operates with respect to both the minimum IPv6 and IPv4 path
   MTUs as follows:

   o  When an OMNI interface sends a packet toward a final destination
      via an ANET peer, it sends without OAL encapsulation if the packet
      (including any outer-layer ANET encapsulations) is no larger than
      the underlying interface MTU for on-link ANET peers or the minimum
      ANET path MTU for peers separated by multiple IP hops.  Otherwise,
      the OAL inserts an IPv6 header per [RFC2473] with source address
      set to the node's own Unique-Local Address (ULA) (see: Section 8)
      and destination set to either the Administrative ULA (ADM-ULA) of
      the ANET peer or the Mobile Network Prefix ULA (MNP-ULA)
      corresponding to the final destination (see below).  The OAL then
      calculates and appends the trailing 32-bit CRC, then uses IPv6
      fragmentation to break the packet into a minimum number of non-
      overlapping fragments where the size of each non-final fragment
      (including both the OMNI and any outer-layer ANET encapsulations)
      is determined by the underlying interface MTU for on-link ANET
      peers or the minimum ANET path MTU for peers separated by multiple
      IP hops.  The OAL then encapsulates the fragments in any ANET
      headers and sends them to the ANET peer, which either reassembles
      before forwarding if the OAL destination is its own ADM-ULA or
      forwards the fragments toward the final destination without first
      reassembling otherwise.

   o  When an OMNI interface sends a packet toward a final destination
      via an INET interface, it sends packets (including any outer-layer
      INET encapsulations) no larger than the minimum INET path MTU
      without OAL encapsulation if the destination is reached via an
      INET address within the same OMNI link segment.  Otherwise, the
      OAL inserts an IPv6 header per [RFC2473] with source address set
      to the node's ULA, destination set to the ULA of the next hop OMNI
      node toward the final destination and (if necessary) with an OMNI
      Routing Header (ORH) (see: [I-D.templin-intarea-6706bis]) with
      final segment addressing information.  The OAL then calculates and
      appends the trailing 32-bit CRC, then uses IPv6 fragmentation to
      break the packet into a minimum number of non-overlapping
      fragments where the size of each non-final fragment (including
      both the OMNI and outer-layer INET encapsulations) is determined
      by the minimum INET path MTU.  The OAL then encapsulates the
      fragments in any INET headers and sends them to the OMNI link
      neighbor, which reassembles before forwarding toward the final
      destination.

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   In light of the above considerations, the OAL should assume a minimum
   path MTU of 576 bytes for the purpose of generating OAL fragments.
   Each OAL fragment will undergo *NET encapsulation including either a
   20 byte IPv4 or 40 byte IPv6 header plus an 8 byte UDP header,
   leaving a minimum of 528 bytes for each fragment.  Each OAL fragment
   must accommodate 48 bytes for the OAL IPv6 header plus fragment
   header, with the remaining space available for a portion of the inner
   IP packet while reserving 40 additional bytes in case a maximum-
   length ORH is added due to re-encapsulation.  OAL fragmentation
   algorithms must therefore produce non-final fragments that are 488
   bytes in length (i.e., not including the ORH length), while the final
   fragment may be smaller.  OAL fragmentation algorithms may produce
   larger non-final fragments if better path MTU information is
   available, but must not produce smaller non-final fragments.

   Note that when two ANET peers share a common physical or virtual link
   with a larger MTU such as 1500 bytes or larger, OAL fragmentation may
   use this larger MTU size as long as the receiving ANET peer
   reassembles (and possibly also refragments) before forwarding.  This
   is important for accommodating links where performance is highly
   dependent on maximum use of the available link MTU, e.g. for wireless
   aviation data links.  Additionally, in order to set the correct
   context for reassembly, the OMNI interface that inserts the OAL
   header MUST also be the one that inserts the IPv6 fragment header
   Identification value.  While not strictly required, sending all
   fragments of the same fragmented OAL packet consecutively over the
   same underlying interface with minimal inter-fragment delay may
   increase the likelihood of successful reassembly.

   Ordinary PTB messages with ICMPv4 header "unused" field or ICMPv6
   header Code field value 0 are hard errors that always indicate that a
   packet has been dropped due to a real MTU restriction.  However, the
   OAL can also forward large packets via encapsulation and
   fragmentation while at the same time returning PTB soft error
   messages (subject to rate limiting) indicating that a forwarded
   packet was uncomfortably large.  The OMNI interface can therefore
   continuously forward large packets without loss while returning PTB
   soft error messages recommending a smaller size.  Original sources
   that receive the soft errors in turn reduce the size of the packets
   they send, i.e., the same as for hard errors.

   The OAL sets the ICMPv4 header "unused" field or ICMPv6 header Code
   field to the value 1 in PTB soft error messages.  The OAL sets the
   PTB destination address to the source address of the original packet,
   and sets the source address to the MNP Subnet Router Anycast address
   of the MN (i.e., whether the MN was the source or target of the
   original packet).  The OAL then sets the MTU field to a value no

   smaller than 576 for ICMPv4 or 1280 for ICMPv6, and returns the PTB
   soft error to the original source.

   When the original source receives the PTB, it reduces its path MTU
   estimate the same as for hard errors but does not regard the message
   as a loss indication.  (If the original source does not recognize the
   soft error code, it regards the PTB the same as a hard error but
   should heed the retransmission advice given in [RFC8201] suggesting
   retransmission based on normal packetization layer retransmission
   timers.)  This document therefore updates [RFC1191][RFC4443] and
   [RFC8201].  Furthermore, implementations of [RFC4821] must be aware
   that PTB hard or soft errors may arrive at any time even if after a
   successful MTU probe (this is the same consideration as for an
   ordinary path fluctuation following a successful probe).

   In summary, the OAL supports continuous transmission and reception of
   packets of various sizes in the face of dynamically changing network
   conditions.  Moreover, since PTB soft errors do not indicate loss,
   original sources that receive soft errors can quickly scan for path
   MTU increases without waiting for the minimum 10 minutes specified
   for loss-oriented PTB hard errors [RFC1191][RFC8201].  The OAL
   therefore provides a lossless and adaptive service that accommodates
   MTU diversity especially well-suited for dynamic multilink
   environments.

   Note: An OMNI interface that reassembles OAL fragments may experience
   congestion-oriented loss in its reassembly cache and can optionally
   send PTB soft errors to the original source and/or ICMP "Time
   Exceeded" messages to the source of the OAL fragments.  In
   environments where the messages may contribute to unacceptable
   additional congestion, however, the OMNI interface can simply regard
   the loss as an ordinary unreported congestion event for which the
   original source will eventually compensate.

   Note: When the network layer forwards an IPv4 packet/fragment with
   DF=0 into the OMNI interface, the interface can optionally perform
   (further) IPv4 fragmentation before invoking the OAL so that the
   fragments will be reassembled by the final destination.  When the
   network layer performs IPv6 fragmentation for locally-generated IPv6
   packets, the OMNI interface typically invokes the OAL without first
   applying (further) IPv6 fragmentation; the network layer should
   therefore fragment to the minimum IPv6 path MTU (or smaller still) to
   push the reassembly burden to the final destination and avoid
   receiving PTB soft errors from the OMNI interface.  Aside from these
   non-normative guidelines, the manner in which any IP fragmentation is
   invoked prior to OAL encapsulation/fragmentation is an implementation
   matter.

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   Note: Inclusion of the 32-bit CRC prior to fragmentation assumes that
   the receiving OAL will discard any packets with incorrect CRC values
   following reassembly.  The 32-bit CRC is sufficient to detect
   reassembly misassociations for packet sizes up to the OMNI interface
   MTU 9180 but may not be sufficient to detect errors for larger sizes
   [CRC].

   Note: Some underlying interface types (e.g., VPNs) may already
   provide their own robust fragmentation and reassembly services even
   without OAL encapsulation.  In those cases, the OAL can invoke the
   inherent underlying interface schemes instead while employing PTB
   soft errors in the same fashion as described above.  Other underlying
   interface properties such as header/message compression can also be
   harnessed in a similar fashion.

   Note: Applications can dynamically tune the size of the packets they
   to send to produce the best possible throughput and latency, with the
   understanding that these parameters may change over time due to
   factors such as congestion, mobility, network path changes, etc.  The
   receipt or absence of soft errors should be seen as hints of when
   increasing or decreasing packet sizes may be beneficial.

5.1.  Fragmentation Security Implications

   As discussed in Section 3.7 of [RFC8900], there are four basic
   threats concerning IPv6 fragmentation; each of which is addressed by
   effective mitigations as follows:

   1.  Overlapping fragment attacks - reassembly of overlapping
       fragments is forbidden by [RFC8200]; therefore, this threat does
       not apply to the OAL.

   2.  Resource exhaustion attacks - this threat is mitigated by
       providing a sufficiently large OAL reassembly cache and
       instituting "fast discard" of incomplete reassemblies that may be
       part of a buffer exhaustion attack.  The reassembly cache should
       be sufficiently large so that a sustained attack does not cause
       excessive loss of good reassemblies but not so large that (timer-
       based) data structure management becomes computationally
       expensive.  The cache should also be indexed based on the arrival
       underlying interface such that congestion experienced over a
       first underlying interface does not cause discard of incomplete
       reassemblies for uncongested underlying interfaces.

   3.  Attacks based on predictable fragment identification values -
       this threat is mitigated by selecting a suitably random ID value
       per [RFC7739].

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   4.  Evasion of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) - this
       threat is mitigated by disallowing "tiny fragments" per the OAL
       fragmentation procedures specified above.

   Additionally, IPv4 fragmentation includes a 16-bit Identification (IP
   ID) field with only 65535 unique values such that at high data rates
   the field could wrap and apply to new packets while the fragments of
   old packets using the same ID are still alive in the network
   [RFC4963].  However, since the largest OAL fragment that will be sent
   via an IPv4 *NET path is 576 bytes any IPv4 fragmentation would occur
   only on links with an IPv4 MTU smaller than this size, and [RFC3819]
   recommendations suggest that such links will have low data rates.
   Since IPv6 provides a 32-bit Identification value, IP ID wraparound
   at high data rates is not a concern for IPv6 fragmentation.

6.  Frame Format

   The OMNI interface transmits IPv6 packets according to the native
   frame format of each underlying interface.  For example, for
   Ethernet-compatible interfaces the frame format is specified in
   [RFC2464], for aeronautical radio interfaces the frame format is
   specified in standards such as ICAO Doc 9776 (VDL Mode 2 Technical
   Manual), for tunnels over IPv6 the frame format is specified in
   [RFC2473], etc.

7.  Link-Local Addresses (LLAs)

   OMNI nodes are assigned OMNI interface IPv6 Link-Local Addresses
   (LLAs) through pre-service administrative actions.  "MNP-LLAs" embed
   the MNP assigned to the mobile node, while "ADM-LLAs" include an
   administratively-unique ID that is guaranteed to be unique on the
   link.  LLAs are configured as follows:

   o  IPv6 MNP-LLAs encode the most-significant 64 bits of a MNP within
      the least-significant 64 bits of the IPv6 link-local prefix
      fe80::/64, i.e., in the LLA "interface identifier" portion.  The
      prefix length for the LLA is determined by adding 64 to the MNP
      prefix length.  For example, for the MNP 2001:db8:1000:2000::/56
      the corresponding MNP-LLA is fe80::2001:db8:1000:2000/120.

   o  IPv4-compatible MNP-LLAs are constructed as fe80::ffff:[IPv4],
      i.e., the interface identifier consists of 16 '0' bits, followed
      by 16 '1' bits, followed by a 32bit IPv4 address/prefix.  The
      prefix length for the LLA is determined by adding 96 to the MNP
      prefix length.  For example, the IPv4-Compatible MN OMNI LLA for
      192.0.2.0/24 is fe80::ffff:192.0.2.0/120 (also written as
      fe80::ffff:c000:0200/120).

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   o  ADM-LLAs are assigned to ARs and MSEs and MUST be managed for
      uniqueness.  The lower 32 bits of the LLA includes a unique
      integer "MSID" value between 0x00000001 and 0xfeffffff, e.g., as
      in fe80::1, fe80::2, fe80::3, etc., fe80::feffffff.  The ADM-LLA
      prefix length is determined by adding 96 to the MSID prefix
      length.  For example, if the prefix length for MSID 0x10012001 is
      16 then the ADM-LLA prefix length is set to 112 and the LLA is
      written as fe80::1001:2001/112.  The "zero" address for each ADM-
      LLA prefix is the Subnet-Router anycast address for that prefix
      [RFC4291]; for example, the Subnet-Router anycast address for
      fe80::1001:2001/112 is simply fe80::1001:2000.  The MSID range
      0xff000000 through 0xffffffff is reserved for future use.

   o  Temporary LLAs are constructed per [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc4941bis] and
      used by MNs for the short-term purpose of procuring an actual MNP-
      LLA upon startup or (re)connecting to the network.  MNs may use
      Temporary LLAs as the IPv6 source address of an RS message in
      order to request a MNP-LLA from the MS.

   Since the prefix 0000::/8 is "Reserved by the IETF" [RFC4291], no
   MNPs can be allocated from that block ensuring that there is no
   possibility for overlap between the various LLA constructs discussed
   above.

   Since MNP-LLAs are based on the distribution of administratively
   assured unique MNPs, and since ADM-LLAs are guaranteed unique through
   administrative assignment, OMNI interfaces set the autoconfiguration
   variable DupAddrDetectTransmits to 0 [RFC4862].

   Temporary LLAs employ optimistic DAD principles [RFC4429] since they
   are probabilistically unique and their use is short-duration in
   nature.

   Note: If future protocol extensions relax the 64-bit boundary in IPv6
   addressing, the additional prefix bits of an MNP could be encoded in
   bits 16 through 63 of the MNP-LLA.  (The most-significant 64 bits
   would therefore still be in bits 64-127, and the remaining bits would
   appear in bits 16 through 48.)  However, the analysis provided in
   [RFC7421] suggests that the 64-bit boundary will remain in the IPv6
   architecture for the forseeable future.

   Note: Even though this document honors the 64-bit boundary in IPv6
   addressing per [RFC7421], it suggests prefix lengths longer than /64
   for routing purposes.  This effectively extends IPv6 routing
   determination into the interface identifier portion of the IPv6
   address, but it does not redefine the 64-bit boundary.

8.  Unique-Local Addresses (ULAs)

   OMNI domains use IPv6 Unique-Local Addresses (ULAs) as the source and
   destination addresses in OAL IPv6 encapsulation headers.  ULAs are
   only routable within the scope of a an OMNI domain, and are derived
   from the IPv6 Unique Local Address prefix fc00::/7 followed by the L
   bit set to 1 (i.e., as fd00::/8) followed by a 40-bit pseudo-random
   Global ID to produce the prefix [ULA]::/48, which is then followed by
   a 16-bit Subnet ID then finally followed by a 64 bit Interface ID as
   specified in Section 3 of [RFC4193].  The statistic uniqueness of the
   40-bit pseudo-random Global ID allows different OMNI domains to be
   joined together in the future without requiring OMNI link
   renumbering.

   Each OMNI link instance is identified by a value between 0x0000 and
   0xfeff in bits 48-63 of [ULA]::/48 (the values 0xff00 through 0xffff
   are reserved for future use).  For example, OMNI ULAs associated with
   instance 0 are configured from the prefix [ULA]:0000::/64, instance 1
   from [ULA]:0001::/64, instance 2 from [ULA]:0002::/64, etc.  ULAs and
   their associated prefix lengths are configured in correspondence with
   LLAs through stateless prefix translation where "MNP-ULAs" are
   assigned in correspondence to MNP-LLAs and "ADM-ULAs" are assigned in
   correspondence to ADM-LLAs.  For example, for OMNI link instance
   [ULA]:1010::/64:

   o  the MNP-ULA corresponding to the MNP-LLA fe80::2001:db8:1:2 with a
      56-bit MNP length is derived by copying the lower 64 bits of the
      LLA into the lower 64 bits of the ULA as
      [ULA]:1010:2001:db8:1:2/120 (where, the ULA prefix length becomes
      64 plus the IPv6 MNP length).

   o  the MNP-ULA corresponding to fe80::ffff:192.0.2.0 with a 28-bit
      MNP length is derived by simply writing the LLA interface ID into
      the lower 64 bits as [ULA]:1010:0:ffff:192.0.2.0/124 (where, the
      ULA prefix length is 64 plus 32 plus the IPv4 MNP length).

   o  the ADM-ULA corresponding to fe80::1000/112 is simply
      [ULA]:1010::1000/112.

   o  the ADM-ULA corresponding to fe80::/128 is simply
      [ULA]:1010::/128.

   o  the Temporary ULA corresponding to a Temporary LLA is simply
      [ULA]:1010:[64-bit Temporary Interface ID]/128.

   o  etc.

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   Each OMNI interface assigns the Anycast ADM-ULA specific to the OMNI
   link instance.  For example, the OMNI interface connected to instance
   3 assigns the Anycast address [ULA]:0003::/128.  Routers that
   configure OMNI interfaces advertise the OMNI service prefix (e.g.,
   [ULA]:0003::/64) into the local routing system so that applications
   can direct traffic according to SBM requirements.

   The ULA presents an IPv6 address format that is routable within the
   OMNI routing system and can be used to convey link-scoped IPv6 ND
   messages across multiple hops using IPv6 encapsulation [RFC2473].
   The OMNI link extends across one or more underling Internetworks to
   include all ARs and MSEs.  All MNs are also considered to be
   connected to the OMNI link, however OAL encapsulation is omitted
   whenever possible to conserve bandwidth (see: Section 12).

   Each OMNI link can be subdivided into "segments" that often
   correspond to different administrative domains or physical
   partitions.  OMNI nodes can use IPv6 Segment Routing [RFC8402] when
   necessary to support efficient packet forwarding to destinations
   located in other OMNI link segments.  A full discussion of Segment
   Routing over the OMNI link appears in [I-D.templin-intarea-6706bis].

   Note: IPv6 ULAs taken from the prefix fc00::/7 followed by the L bit
   set to 0 (i.e., as fc00::/8) are never used for OMNI OAL addressing,
   however the range could be used for MSP and MNP addressing under
   certain limiting conditions (see: Section 9).

9.  Global Unicast Addresses (GUAs)

   OMNI domains use IP Global Unicast Address (GUA) prefixes [RFC4291]
   as Mobility Service Prefixes (MSPs) from which Mobile Network
   Prefixes (MNP) are delegated to Mobile Nodes (MNs).

   For IPv6, GUA prefixes are assigned by IANA [IPV6-GUA] and/or an
   associated regional assigned numbers authority such that the OMNI
   domain can be interconnected to the global IPv6 Internet without
   causing inconsistencies in the routing system.  An OMNI domain could
   instead use ULAs with the 'L' bit set to 0 (i.e., from the prefix
   fc00::/8)[RFC4193], however this would require IPv6 NAT if the domain
   were ever connected to the global IPv6 Internet.

   For IPv4, GUA prefixes are assigned by IANA [IPV4-GUA] and/or an
   associated regional assigned numbers authority such that the OMNI
   domain can be interconnected to the global IPv4 Internet without
   causing routing inconsistencies.  An OMNI domain could instead use
   private IPv4 prefixes (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8, etc.)  [RFC3330], however
   this would require IPv4 NAT if the domain were ever connected to the
   global IPv4 Internet.

10.  Address Mapping - Unicast

   OMNI interfaces maintain a neighbor cache for tracking per-neighbor
   state and use the link-local address format specified in Section 7.
   OMNI interface IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) [RFC4861] messages sent
   over physical underlying interfaces without encapsulation observe the
   native underlying interface Source/Target Link-Layer Address Option
   (S/TLLAO) format (e.g., for Ethernet the S/TLLAO is specified in
   [RFC2464]).  OMNI interface IPv6 ND messages sent over underlying
   interfaces via encapsulation do not include S/TLLAOs which were
   intended for encoding physical L2 media address formats and not
   encapsulation IP addresses.  Furthermore, S/TLLAOs are not intended
   for encoding additional interface attributes needed for multilink
   coordination.  Hence, this document does not define an S/TLLAO format
   but instead defines a new option type termed the "OMNI option"
   designed for these purposes.

   MNs such as aircraft typically have many wireless data link types
   (e.g. satellite-based, cellular, terrestrial, air-to-air directional,
   etc.) with diverse performance, cost and availability properties.
   The OMNI interface would therefore appear to have multiple L2
   connections, and may include information for multiple underlying
   interfaces in a single IPv6 ND message exchange.  OMNI interfaces use
   an IPv6 ND option called the OMNI option formatted as shown in
   Figure 3:

        0                   1                   2                   3

   o  Length is set to the number of 8 octet blocks in the option.

   o  T is a 1-bit flag set to 1 for Temporary LLAs (otherwise, set to
      0) and Preflen is a 7 bit field that determines the length of

      prefix associated with an LLA.  Values 1 through 127 specify a
      prefix length, while the value 0 indicates "unspecified".  For
      IPv6 ND messages sent from a MN to the MS, T and Preflen apply to
      the IPv6 source LLA and provide the length that the MN is
      requesting or asserting to the MS.  For IPv6 ND messages sent from
      the MS to the MN, T and Preflen apply to the IPv6 destination LLA
      and indicate the length that the MS is granting to the MN.  For
      IPv6 ND messages sent between MS endpoints, T is set to 0 and
      Preflen provides the length associated with the source/target MN
      that is subject of the ND message.

   o  S/T-ifIndex corresponds to the ifIndex value for source or target
      underlying interface used to convey this IPv6 ND message.  OMNI
      interfaces MUST number each distinct underlying interface with an
      ifIndex value between '1' and '255' that represents a MN-specific
      8-bit mapping for the actual ifIndex value assigned by network
      management [RFC2863] (the ifIndex value '0' is reserved for use by
      the MS).  For RS and NS messages, S/T-ifIndex corresponds to the
      source underlying interface the message originated from.  For RA
      and NA messages, S/T-ifIndex corresponds to the target underlying
      interface that the message is destined to.  (For NS messages used
      for Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD), S/T-ifIndex instead
      identifies the neighbor's underlying interface to be used as the
      target interface to return the NA.)

   o  Sub-Options is a Variable-length field, of length such that the
      complete OMNI Option is an integer multiple of 8 octets long.
      Contains one or more Sub-Options, as described in Section 10.1.

10.1.  Sub-Options

10.1.3.  Interface Attributes

   The Interface Attributes sub-option provides L2 forwarding
   information for the multilink conceptual sending algorithm discussed
   in Section 12.  The L2 information is used for selecting among
   potentially multiple candidate underlying interfaces that can be used
   to forward packets to the neighbor based on factors such as DSCP
   preferences and link quality.  Interface Attributes further include
   link-layer address information to be used for either OAL
   encapsulation or direct UDP/IP encapsulation (when OAL encapsulation
   can be avoided).  The Interface Attributes format and contents are
   given in Figure 8 below:

   o  Sub-Type is set to 2.  If multiple instances with different
      ifIndex values appear in the same OMNI option all are processed;
      if multiple instances with the same ifIndex value appear, the
      first is processed and all others are ignored.

   o  Sub-Length is set to N (from 4 to 255) that encodes the number of
      Sub-Option Data octets that follow.

   o  Sub-Option Data contains an "Interface Attribute" option encoded
      as follows (note that the first four octets must be present):

      *  ifIndex is set to an 8-bit integer value corresponding to a
         specific underlying interface the same as specified above for
         the OMNI option header S/T-ifIndex.  An OMNI option may include
         multiple Interface Attributes Sub-Options, with each distinct
         ifIndex value pertaining to a different underlying interface.
         The OMNI option will often include an Interface Attributes Sub-
         Option with the same ifIndex value that appears in the S/
         T-ifIndex.  In that case, the actual encapsulation address of
         the received IPv6 ND message should be compared with the L2ADDR
         encoded in the Sub-Option (see below); if the addresses are
         different (or, if L2ADDR is absent) the presence of a NAT is
         assumed.

      *  ifType is set to an 8-bit integer value corresponding to the
         underlying interface identified by ifIndex.  The value

         represents an OMNI interface-specific 8-bit mapping for the
         actual IANA ifType value registered in the 'IANAifType-MIB'
         registry [http://www.iana.org].

      *  Provider ID is set to an OMNI interface-specific 8-bit ID value
         for the network service provider associated with this ifIndex.

      *  Link encodes a 4-bit link metric.  The value '0' means the link
         is DOWN, and the remaining values mean the link is UP with
         metric ranging from '1' ("lowest") to '15' ("highest").

      *  R is reserved for future use.

      *  API - a 3-bit "Address/Preferences/Indexed" code that
         determines the contents of the remainder of the sub-option as
         follows:

         +  When the most significant bit (i.e., "Address") is set to 1,
            the SRT, FMT, LHS and L2ADDR fields are included immediately
            following the API code; else, they are omitted.

         +  When the next most significant bit (i.e., "Preferences") is
            set to 1, a preferences block is included next; else, it is
            omitted.  (Note that if "Address" is set the preferences
            block immediately follows L2ADDR; else, it immediately
            follows the API code.)

         +  When a preferences block is present and the least
            significant bit (i.e., "Indexed") is set to 0, the block is
            encoded in "Simplex" form as shown in Figure 8; else it is
            encoded in "Indexed" form as discussed below.

      *  When API indicates that an "Address" is included, the following
         fields appear in consecutive order (else, they are omitted):

         +  SRT - a 5-bit Segment Routing Topology prefix length value
            that (when added to 96) determines the prefix length to
            apply to the ULA formed from concatenating [ULA*]::/96 with
            the 32 bit LHS MSID value that follows.  For example, the
            value 16 corresponds to the prefix length 112.

         +  FMT - a 3-bit "Framework/Mode/Type" code corresponding to
            the included Link Layer Address as follows:

            -  When the most significant bit (i.e., "Framework") is set
               to 0, L2ADDR is the INET encapsulation address of a
               Proxy/Server; otherwise, it is the address for the
               Source/Target itself



Templin & Whyman          Expires July 5, 2021                 [Page 28]

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


            -  When the next most significant bit (i.e., "Mode") is set
               to 0, the Source/Target L2ADDR is on the open INET;
               otherwise, it is (likely) located behind one or more
               NATs.

            -  When the least significant bit (i.e., "Type") is set to
               0, L2ADDR includes a UDP Port Number followed by an IPv4
               address; else, a UDP Port Number followed by an IPv6
               address.

         +  LHS - the 32 bit MSID of the Last Hop Server/Proxy on the
            path to the target.  When SRT and LHS are both set to 0, the
            LHS is considered unspecified in this IPv6 ND message.  When
            SRT is set to 0 and LHS is non-zero, the prefix length is
            set to 128.  SRT and LHS together provide guidance to the
            OMNI interface forwarding algorithm.  Specifically, if SRT/
            LHS is located in the local OMNI link segment then the OMNI
            interface can encapsulate according to FMT/L2ADDR (following
            any necessary NAT traversal messaging); else, it must
            forward according to the OMNI link spanning tree.  See
            [I-D.templin-intarea-6706bis] for further discussion.

         +  Link Layer Address (L2ADDR) - Formatted according to FMT,
            and identifies the link-layer address (i.e., the
            encapsulation address) of the source/target.  The UDP Port
            Number appears in the first two octets and the IP address
            appears in the next 4 octets for IPv4 or 16 octets for IPv6.
            The Port Number and IP address are recorded in ones-
            compliment "obfuscated" form per [RFC4380].  The OMNI
            interface forwarding algorithm uses FMT/L2ADDR to determine
            the encapsulation address for forwarding when SRT/LHS is
            located in the local OMNI link segment.  Note that if the
            target is behind a NAT, L2ADDR will contain the mapped INET
            address stored in the NAT; otherwise, L2ADDR will contain
            the native INET information of the target itself.

      *  When API indicates that "Preferences" are included, a
         preferences block appears as the remainder of the Sub-Option as
         a series of Bitmaps and P[*] values.  In "Simplex" form, the
         index for each singleton Bitmap octet is inferred from its
         sequential position (i.e., 0, 1, 2, ...) as shown in Figure 8.
         In "Indexed" form, each Bitmap is preceded by an Index octet
         that encodes a value "i" = (0 - 255) as the index for its
         companion Bitmap as follows:

        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

                                 Figure 9

      *  The preferences consist of a first (simplex/indexed) Bitmap
         (i.e., "Bitmap(i)") followed by 0-8 single-octet blocks of
         2-bit P[*] values, followed by a second Bitmap (i), followed by
         0-8 blocks of P[*] values, etc.  Reading from bit 0 to bit 7,
         the bits of each Bitmap(i) that are set to '1'' indicate the
         P[*] blocks from the range P[(i*32)] through P[(i*32) + 31]
         that follow; if any Bitmap(i) bits are '0', then the
         corresponding P[*] block is instead omitted.  For example, if
         Bitmap(0) contains 0xff then the block with P[00]-P[03],
         followed by the block with P[04]-P[07], etc., and ending with
         the block with P[28]-P[31] are included (as shown in Figure 8).
         The next Bitmap(i) is then consulted with its bits indicating
         which P[*] blocks follow, etc. out to the end of the Sub-
         Option.

      *  Each 2-bit P[*] field is set to the value '0' ("disabled"), '1'
         ("low"), '2' ("medium") or '3' ("high") to indicate a QoS
         preference for underlying interface selection purposes.  Not
         all P[*] values need to be included in the OMNI option of each
         IPv6 ND message received.  Any P[*] values represented in an
         earlier OMNI option but omitted in the current OMNI option
         remain unchanged.  Any P[*] values not yet represented in any
         OMNI option default to "medium".

      *  The first 16 P[*] blocks correspond to the 64 Differentiated
         Service Code Point (DSCP) values P[00] - P[63] [RFC2474].  Any
         additional P[*] blocks that follow correspond to "pseudo-DSCP"
         traffic classifier values P[64], P[65], P[66], etc.  See
         Appendix A for further discussion and examples.

11.  Address Mapping - Multicast

   The multicast address mapping of the native underlying interface
   applies.  The mobile router on board the MN also serves as an IGMP/
   MLD Proxy for its EUNs and/or hosted applications per [RFC4605] while
   using the L2 address of the AR as the L2 address for all multicast
   packets.





Templin & Whyman          Expires July 5, 2021                 [Page 34]

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   The MN uses Multicast Listener Discovery (MLDv2) [RFC3810] to
   coordinate with the AR, and *NET L2 elements use MLD snooping
   [RFC4541].

12.  Multilink Conceptual Sending Algorithm

   The MN's IPv6 layer selects the outbound OMNI interface according to
   SBM considerations when forwarding data packets from local or EUN
   applications to external correspondents.  Each OMNI interface
   maintains a neighbor cache the same as for any IPv6 interface, but
   with additional state for multilink coordination.  Each OMNI
   interface maintains default routes via ARs discovered as discussed in
   Section 13, and may configure more-specific routes discovered through
   means outside the scope of this specification.

   After a packet enters the OMNI interface, one or more outbound
   underlying interfaces are selected based on PBM traffic attributes,
   and one or more neighbor underlying interfaces are selected based on
   the receipt of Interface Attributes sub-options in IPv6 ND messages
   (see: Figure 8).  Underlying interface selection for the nodes own
   local interfaces are based on attributes such as DSCP, application
   port number, cost, performance, message size, etc.  OMNI interface
   multilink selections could also be configured to perform replication
   across multiple underlying interfaces for increased reliability at
   the expense of packet duplication.  The set of all Interface
   Attributes received in IPv6 ND messages determine the multilink
   forwarding profile for selecting the neighbor's underlying
   interfaces.

   When the OMNI interface sends a packet over a selected outbound
   underlying interface, the OAL includes or omits a mid-layer
   encapsulation header as necessary as discussed in Section 5 and as
   determined by the L2 address information received in Interface
   Attributes.  The OAL also performs encapsulation when the nearest AR
   is located multiple hops away as discussed in Section 13.1.

   OMNI interface multilink service designers MUST observe the BCP
   guidance in Section 15 [RFC3819] in terms of implications for
   reordering when packets from the same flow may be spread across
   multiple underlying interfaces having diverse properties.

12.1.  Multiple OMNI Interfaces

   MNs may connect to multiple independent OMNI links concurrently in
   support of SBM.  Each OMNI interface is distinguished by its Anycast
   ULA (e.g., [ULA]:0002::, [ULA]:1000::, [ULA]:7345::, etc.).  The MN
   configures a separate OMNI interface for each link so that multiple
   interfaces (e.g., omni0, omni1, omni2, etc.) are exposed to the IPv6



Templin & Whyman          Expires July 5, 2021                 [Page 35]

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   layer.  A different Anycast ULA is assigned to each interface, and
   the MN injects the service prefixes for the OMNI link instances into
   the EUN routing system.

   Applications in EUNs can use Segment Routing to select the desired
   OMNI interface based on SBM considerations.  The Anycast ULA is
   written into the IPv6 destination address, and the actual destination
   (along with any additional intermediate hops) is written into the
   Segment Routing Header.  Standard IP routing directs the packets to
   the MN's mobile router entity, and the Anycast ULA identifies the
   OMNI interface to be used for transmission to the next hop.  When the
   MN receives the message, it replaces the IPv6 destination address
   with the next hop found in the routing header and transmits the
   message over the OMNI interface identified by the Anycast ULA.

   Multiple distinct OMNI links can therefore be used to support fault
   tolerance, load balancing, reliability, etc.  The architectural model
   is similar to Layer 2 Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs).

12.2.  MN<->AR Traffic Loop Prevention

   After an AR has registered an MNP for a MN (see: Section 13), the AR
   will forward packets destined to an address within the MNP to the MN.
   The MN will under normal circumstances then forward the packet to the
   correct destination within its internal networks.

   If at some later time the MN loses state (e.g., after a reboot), it
   may begin returning packets destined to an MNP address to the AR as
   its default router.  The AR therefore must drop any packets
   originating from the MN and destined to an address within the MN's
   registered MNP.  To do so, the AR institutes the following check:

   o  if the IP destination address belongs to a neighbor on the same
      OMNI interface, and if the link-layer source address is the same
      as one of the neighbor's link-layer addresses, drop the packet.

13.  Router Discovery and Prefix Registration

   MNs interface with the MS by sending RS messages with OMNI options
   under the assumption that one or more AR on the *NET will process the
   message and respond.  The MN then configures default routes for the
   OMNI interface via the discovered ARs as the next hop.  The manner in
   which the *NET ensures AR coordination is link-specific and outside
   the scope of this document (however, considerations for *NETs that do
   not provide ARs that recognize the OMNI option are discussed in
   Section 18).





Templin & Whyman          Expires July 5, 2021                 [Page 36]

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   For each underlying interface, the MN sends an RS message with an
   OMNI option to coordinate with MSEs identified by MSID values.
   Example MSID discovery methods are given in [RFC5214] and include
   data link login parameters, name service lookups, static
   configuration, a static "hosts" file, etc.  The MN can also send an
   RS with an MS-Register sub-option that includes the Anycast MSID
   value '0', i.e., instead of or in addition to any non-zero MSIDs.
   When the AR receives an RS with a MSID '0', it selects a nearby MSE
   (which may be itself) and returns an RA with the selected MSID in an
   MS-Register sub-option.  The AR selects only a single wildcard MSE
   (i.e., even if the RS MS-Register sub-option included multiple '0'
   MSIDs) while also soliciting the MSEs corresponding to any non-zero
   MSIDs.

   MNs configure OMNI interfaces that observe the properties discussed
   in the previous section.  The OMNI interface and its underlying
   interfaces are said to be in either the "UP" or "DOWN" state
   according to administrative actions in conjunction with the interface
   connectivity status.  An OMNI interface transitions to UP or DOWN
   through administrative action and/or through state transitions of the
   underlying interfaces.  When a first underlying interface transitions
   to UP, the OMNI interface also transitions to UP.  When all
   underlying interfaces transition to DOWN, the OMNI interface also
   transitions to DOWN.

   When an OMNI interface transitions to UP, the MN sends RS messages to
   register its MNP and an initial set of underlying interfaces that are
   also UP.  The MN sends additional RS messages to refresh lifetimes
   and to register/deregister underlying interfaces as they transition
   to UP or DOWN.  The MN sends initial RS messages over an UP
   underlying interface with its MNP-LLA as the source and with
   destination set to All-Routers multicast (ff02::2) [RFC4291].  The RS
   messages include an OMNI option per Section 10 with a Preflen
   assertion, Interface Attributes appropriate for underlying
   interfaces, MS-Register/Release sub-options containing MSID values,
   and with any other necessary OMNI sub-options (e.g., a DUID sub-
   option as an identity for the MN).  The S/T-ifIndex field is set to
   the index of the underlying interface over which the RS message is
   sent.

   ARs process IPv6 ND messages with OMNI options and act as an MSE
   themselves and/or as a proxy for other MSEs.  ARs receive RS messages
   and create a neighbor cache entry for the MN, then coordinate with
   any MSEs named in the Register/Release lists in a manner outside the
   scope of this document.  When an MSE processes the OMNI information,
   it first validates the prefix registration information then injects/
   withdraws the MNP in the routing/mapping system and caches/discards
   the new Preflen, MNP and Interface Attributes.  The MSE then informs

   the AR of registration success/failure, and the AR returns an RA
   message to the MN with an OMNI option per Section 10.

   The AR returns the RA message via the same underlying interface of
   the MN over which the RS was received, and with destination address
   set to the MNP-LLA (i.e., unicast), with source address set to its
   own LLA, and with an OMNI option with S/T-ifIndex set to the value
   included in the RS.  The OMNI option also includes a Preflen
   confirmation, Interface Attributes, MS-Register/Release and any other
   necessary OMNI sub-options (e.g., a DUID sub-option as an identity
   for the AR).  The RA also includes any information for the link,
   including RA Cur Hop Limit, M and O flags, Router Lifetime, Reachable
   Time and Retrans Timer values, and includes any necessary options
   such as:

   o  PIOs with (A; L=0) that include MSPs for the link [RFC8028].

   o  RIOs [RFC4191] with more-specific routes.

   o  an MTU option that specifies the maximum acceptable packet size
      for this underlying interface.

   The AR MAY also send periodic and/or event-driven unsolicited RA
   messages per [RFC4861].  In that case, the S/T-ifIndex field in the
   OMNI header of the unsolicited RA message identifies the target
   underlying interface of the destination MN.

   The AR can combine the information from multiple MSEs into one or
   more "aggregate" RAs sent to the MN in order conserve *NET bandwidth.
   Each aggregate RA includes an OMNI option with MS-Register/Release
   sub-options with the MSEs represented by the aggregate.  If an
   aggregate is sent, the RA message contents must consistently
   represent the combined information advertised by all represented
   MSEs.  Note that since the AR uses its own ADM-LLA as the RA source
   address, the MN determines the addresses of the represented MSEs by
   examining the MS-Register/Release OMNI sub-options.

   When the MN receives the RA message, it creates an OMNI interface
   neighbor cache entry for each MSID that has confirmed MNP
   registration via the L2 address of this AR.  If the MN connects to
   multiple *NETs, it records the additional L2 AR addresses in each
   MSID neighbor cache entry (i.e., as multilink neighbors).  The MN
   then configures a default route via the MSE that returned the RA
   message, and assigns the Subnet Router Anycast address corresponding
   to the MNP (e.g., 2001:db8:1:2::) to the OMNI interface.  The MN then
   manages its underlying interfaces according to their states as
   follows:

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   o  When an underlying interface transitions to UP, the MN sends an RS
      over the underlying interface with an OMNI option.  The OMNI
      option contains at least one Interface Attribute sub-option with
      values specific to this underlying interface, and may contain
      additional Interface Attributes specific to other underlying
      interfaces.  The option also includes any MS-Register/Release sub-
      options.

   o  When an underlying interface transitions to DOWN, the MN sends an
      RS or unsolicited NA message over any UP underlying interface with
      an OMNI option containing an Interface Attribute sub-option for
      the DOWN underlying interface with Link set to '0'.  The MN sends
      an RS when an acknowledgement is required, or an unsolicited NA
      when reliability is not thought to be a concern (e.g., if
      redundant transmissions are sent on multiple underlying
      interfaces).

   o  When the Router Lifetime for a specific AR nears expiration, the
      MN sends an RS over the underlying interface to receive a fresh
      RA.  If no RA is received, the MN can send RS messages to an
      alternate MSID in case the current MSID has failed.  If no RS
      messages are received even after trying to contact alternate
      MSIDs, the MN marks the underlying interface as DOWN.

   o  When a MN wishes to release from one or more current MSIDs, it
      sends an RS or unsolicited NA message over any UP underlying
      interfaces with an OMNI option with a Release MSID.  Each MSID
      then withdraws the MNP from the routing/mapping system and informs
      the AR that the release was successful.

   o  When all of a MNs underlying interfaces have transitioned to DOWN
      (or if the prefix registration lifetime expires), any associated
      MSEs withdraw the MNP the same as if they had received a message
      with a release indication.

   The MN is responsible for retrying each RS exchange up to
   MAX_RTR_SOLICITATIONS times separated by RTR_SOLICITATION_INTERVAL
   seconds until an RA is received.  If no RA is received over an UP
   underlying interface (i.e., even after attempting to contact
   alternate MSEs), the MN declares this underlying interface as DOWN.

   The IPv6 layer sees the OMNI interface as an ordinary IPv6 interface.
   Therefore, when the IPv6 layer sends an RS message the OMNI interface
   returns an internally-generated RA message as though the message
   originated from an IPv6 router.  The internally-generated RA message
   contains configuration information that is consistent with the
   information received from the RAs generated by the MS.  Whether the
   OMNI interface IPv6 ND messaging process is initiated from the



Templin & Whyman          Expires July 5, 2021                 [Page 39]

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   receipt of an RS message from the IPv6 layer is an implementation
   matter.  Some implementations may elect to defer the IPv6 ND
   messaging process until an RS is received from the IPv6 layer, while
   others may elect to initiate the process proactively.  Still other
   deployments may elect to administratively disable the ordinary RS/RA
   messaging used by the IPv6 layer over the OMNI interface, since they
   are not required to drive the internal RS/RA processing.  (Note that
   this same logic applies to IPv4 implementations that employ ICMP-
   based Router Discovery per [RFC1256].)

   Note: The Router Lifetime value in RA messages indicates the time
   before which the MN must send another RS message over this underlying
   interface (e.g., 600 seconds), however that timescale may be
   significantly longer than the lifetime the MS has committed to retain
   the prefix registration (e.g., REACHABLETIME seconds).  ARs are
   therefore responsible for keeping MS state alive on a shorter
   timescale than the MN is required to do on its own behalf.

   Note: On multicast-capable underlying interfaces, MNs should send
   periodic unsolicited multicast NA messages and ARs should send
   periodic unsolicited multicast RA messages as "beacons" that can be
   heard by other nodes on the link.  If a node fails to receive a
   beacon after a timeout value specific to the link, it can initiate a
   unicast exchange to test reachability.

   Note: if an AR acting as a proxy forwards a MN's RS message to
   another node acting as an MSE using UDP/IP encapsulation, it must use
   a distinct UDP source port number for each MN.  This allows the MSE
   to distinguish different MNs behind the same AR at the link-layer,
   whereas the link-layer addresses would otherwise be
   indistinguishable.

   Note: when an AR acting as an MSE returns an RA to an INET Client, it
   includes an OMNI option with an Interface Attributes sub-option with
   ifIndex set to 0 and with SRT, FMT, LHS and L2ADDR information for
   its INET interface.  This provides the Client with partition prefix
   context regarding the local OMNI link segment.

13.1.  Router Discovery in IP Multihop and IPv4-Only Networks

   On some *NETs, a MN may be located multiple IP hops away from the
   nearest AR.  Forwarding through IP multihop *NETs is conducted
   through the application of a routing protocol (e.g., a Mobile Ad-hoc
   Network (MANET) routing protocol over omni-directional wireless
   interfaces, an inter-domain routing protocol in an enterprise
   network, etc.).  These *NETs could be either IPv6-enabled or
   IPv4-only, while IPv4-only *NETs could be either multicast-capable or




Templin & Whyman          Expires July 5, 2021                 [Page 40]

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   unicast-only (note that for IPv4-only *NETs the following procedures
   apply for both single-hop and multihop cases).

   A MN located potentially multiple *NET hops away from the nearest AR
   prepares an RS message with source address set to either its MNP-LLA
   or a Temporary LLA, and with destination set to link-scoped All-
   Routers multicast the same as discussed above.  For IPv6-enabled
   *NETs, the MN then encapsulates the message in an IPv6 header with
   source address set to the ULA corresponding to the LLA source address
   and with destination set to either a unicast or anycast ADM-ULA.  For
   IPv4-only *NETs, the MN instead encapsulates the RS message in an
   IPv4 header with source address set to the node's own IPv4 address
   and with destination address set to either the unicast IPv4 address
   of an AR [RFC5214] or an IPv4 anycast address reserved for OMNI.  The
   MN then sends the encapsulated RS message via the *NET interface,
   where it will be forwarded by zero or more intermediate *NET hops.

   When an intermediate *NET hop that participates in the routing
   protocol receives the encapsulated RS, it forwards the message
   according to its routing tables (note that an intermediate node could
   be a fixed infrastructure element or another MN).  This process
   repeats iteratively until the RS message is received by a penultimate
   *NET hop within single-hop communications range of an AR, which
   forwards the message to the AR.

   When the AR receives the message, it decapsulates the RS and
   coordinates with the MS the same as for an ordinary link-local RS,
   since the inner Hop Limit will not have been decremented by the
   multihop forwarding process.  The AR then prepares an RA message with
   source address set to its own ADM-LLA and destination address set to
   the LLA of the original MN, then encapsulates the message in an IPv4/
   IPv6 header with source address set to its own IPv4/ULA address and
   with destination set to the encapsulation source of the RS.

   The AR then forwards the message to an *NET node within
   communications range, which forwards the message according to its
   routing tables to an intermediate node.  The multihop forwarding
   process within the *NET continues repetitively until the message is
   delivered to the original MN, which decapsulates the message and
   performs autoconfiguration the same as if it had received the RA
   directly from the AR as an on-link neighbor.

   Note: An alternate approach to multihop forwarding via IPv6
   encapsulation would be to statelessly translate the IPv6 LLAs into
   ULAs and forward the messages without encapsulation.  This would
   violate the [RFC4861] requirement that certain IPv6 ND messages must
   use link-local addresses and must not be accepted if received with
   Hop Limit less than 255.  This document therefore advocates



Templin & Whyman          Expires July 5, 2021                 [Page 41]

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   encapsulation since the overhead is nominal considering the
   infrequent nature and small size of IPv6 ND messages.  Future
   documents may consider encapsulation avoidance through translation
   while updating [RFC4861].

   Note: An alternate approach to multihop forwarding via IPv4
   encapsulation would be to employ IPv6/IPv4 protocol translation.
   However, for IPv6 ND messages the LLAs would be truncated due to
   translation and the OMNI Router and Prefix Discovery services would
   not be able to function.  The use of IPv4 encapsulation is therefore
   indicated.

   Note: An IPv4 anycast address for OMNI in IPv4 networks could be part
   of a new IPv4 /24 prefix allocation, but this may be difficult to
   obtain given IPv4 address exhaustion.  An alternative would be to re-
   purpose the prefix 192.88.99.0 which has been set aside from its
   former use by [RFC7526].

13.2.  MS-Register and MS-Release List Processing

   When a MN sends an RS message with an OMNI option via an underlying
   interface to an AR, the MN must convey its knowledge of its
   currently-associated MSEs.  Initially, the MN will have no associated
   MSEs and should therefore include an MS-Register sub-option with the
   single MSID value 0 which requests the AR to select and assign an
   MSE.  The AR will then return an RA message with source address set
   to the ADM-LLA of the selected MSE.

   As the MN activates additional underlying interfaces, it can
   optionally include an MS-Register sub-option with MSID value 0, or
   with non-zero MSIDs for MSEs discovered from previous RS/RA
   exchanges.  The MN will thus eventually begin to learn and manage its
   currently active set of MSEs, and can register with new MSEs or
   release from former MSEs with each successive RS/RA exchange.  As the
   MN's MSE constituency grows, it alone is responsible for including or
   omitting MSIDs in the MS-Register/Release lists it sends in RS
   messages.  The inclusion or omission of MSIDs determines the MN's
   interface to the MS and defines the manner in which MSEs will
   respond.  The only limiting factor is that the MN should include no
   more than MAX_MSID values in each list per each IPv6 ND message, and
   should avoid duplication of entries in each list unless it wants to
   increase likelihood of control message delivery.

   When an AR receives an RS message sent by a MN with an OMNI option,
   the option will contain zero or more MS-Register and MS-Release sub-
   options containing MSIDs.  After processing the OMNI option, the AR
   will have a list of zero or more MS-Register MSIDs and a list of zero

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   or more of MS-Release MSIDs.  The AR then processes the lists as
   follows:

   o  For each list, retain the first MAX_MSID values in the list and
      discard any additional MSIDs (i.e., even if there are duplicates
      within a list).

   o  Next, for each MSID in the MS-Register list, remove all matching
      MSIDs from the MS-Release list.

   o  Next, proceed according to whether the AR's own MSID or the value
      0 appears in the MS-Register list as follows:

      *  If yes, send an RA message directly back to the MN and send a
         proxy copy of the RS message to each additional MSID in the MS-
         Register list with the MS-Register/Release lists omitted.
         Then, send a uNA message to each MSID in the MS-Release list
         with the MS-Register/Release lists omitted and with an OMNI
         header with S/T-ifIndex set to 0.

      *  If no, send a proxy copy of the RS message to each additional
         MSID in the MS-Register list with the MS-Register list omitted.
         For the first MSID, include the original MS-Release list; for
         all other MSIDs, omit the MS-Release list.

   Each proxy copy of the RS message will include an OMNI option and
   encapsulation header with the ADM-ULA of the AR as the source and the
   ADM-ULA of the Register MSE as the destination.  When the Register
   MSE receives the proxy RS message, if the message includes an MS-
   Release list the MSE sends a uNA message to each additional MSID in
   the Release list.  The Register MSE then sends an RA message back to
   the (Proxy) AR wrapped in an OMNI encapsulation header with source
   and destination addresses reversed, and with RA destination set to
   the MNP-LLA of the MN.  When the AR receives this RA message, it
   sends a proxy copy of the RA to the MN.

   Each uNA message (whether send by the first-hop AR or by a Register
   MSE) will include an OMNI option and an encapsulation header with the
   ADM-ULA of the Register MSE as the source and the ADM-ULA of the
   Release ME as the destination.  The uNA informs the Release MSE that
   its previous relationship with the MN has been released and that the
   source of the uNA message is now registered.  The Release MSE must
   then note that the subject MN of the uNA message is now "departed",
   and forward any subsequent packets destined to the MN to the Register
   MSE.

   Note that it is not an error for the MS-Register/Release lists to
   include duplicate entries.  If duplicates occur within a list, the AR

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   will generate multiple proxy RS and/or uNA messages - one for each
   copy of the duplicate entries.

13.3.  DHCPv6-based Prefix Registration

   When a MN is not pre-provisioned with an MNP-LLA (or, when multiple
   MNPs are needed), it will require the AR to select MNPs on its behalf
   and set up the correct routing state within the MS.  The DHCPv6
   service [RFC8415] supports this requirement.

   When an MN needs to have the AR select MNPs, it sends an RS message
   with a Temporary LLA as the source and with DHCPv6 Message sub-option
   containing a Client Identifier, one or more IA_PD options and a Rapid
   Commit option.  The MN also sets the 'msg-type' field to "Solicit",
   and includes a 3-octet 'transaction-id'.

   When the AR receives the RS message, it extracts the DHCPv6 message
   from the OMNI option.  The AR then acts as a "Proxy DHCPv6 Client" in
   a message exchange with the locally-resident DHCPv6 server, which
   delegates MNPs and returns a DHCPv6 Reply message with PD parameters.
   (If the AR wishes to defer creation of MN state until the DHCPv6
   Reply is received, it can instead act as a Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay
   Agent per [RFC6221] by encapsulating the DHCPv6 message in a Relay-
   forward/reply exchange with Relay Message and Interface ID options.)

   When the AR receives the DHCPv6 Reply, it adds routes to the routing
   system and creates MNP-LLAs based on the delegated MNPs.  The AR then
   sends an RA back to the MN with the DHCPv6 Reply message included in
   an OMNI DHCPv6 message sub-option.  If the RS message source address
   was a Temporary address, the AR includes one of the (newly-created)
   MNP-LLAs as the RA destination address.  The MN then creates a
   default route, assigns Subnet Router Anycast addresses and uses the
   RA destination address as its primary MNP-LLA.  The MN will then use
   this primary MNP-LLA as the source address of any IPv6 ND messages it
   sends as long as it retains ownership of the MNP.

   Note: The single-octet OMNI sub-option length field restricts the
   DHCPv6 Message sub-option to a maximum of 255 octets for both the RS
   and RA messages.  This provides sufficient room for the DHCPv6
   message header, a Client/Server Identifier option, a Rapid Commit
   option, at least 3 Identity Association for Prefix Delegation (IA_PD)
   options and any other supporting DHCPv6 options.  A MN requiring more
   DHCPv6-based configuration information than this can either perform
   multiple independent RS/RA exchanges (with each exchange providing a
   subset of the total configuration information) or simply perform an
   actual DHCPv6 message exchange in addition to any RS/RA exchanges.





Templin & Whyman          Expires July 5, 2021                 [Page 44]

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   Note: After a MN performs a DHCPv6-based prefix registration exchange
   with a first AR, it would need to repeat the exchange with each
   additional MSE it registers with.  In that case, the MN supplies the
   MNP delegations received from the first AR in the IA_PD fields of a
   DHCPv6 message when it engages the additional MSEs.

14.  Secure Redirection

   If the *NET link model is multiple access, the AR is responsible for
   assuring that address duplication cannot corrupt the neighbor caches
   of other nodes on the link.  When the MN sends an RS message on a
   multiple access *NET link, the AR verifies that the MN is authorized
   to use the address and returns an RA with a non-zero Router Lifetime
   only if the MN is authorized.

   After verifying MN authorization and returning an RA, the AR MAY
   return IPv6 ND Redirect messages to direct MNs located on the same
   *NET link to exchange packets directly without transiting the AR.  In
   that case, the MNs can exchange packets according to their unicast L2
   addresses discovered from the Redirect message instead of using the
   dogleg path through the AR.  In some *NET links, however, such direct
   communications may be undesirable and continued use of the dogleg
   path through the AR may provide better performance.  In that case,
   the AR can refrain from sending Redirects, and/or MNs can ignore
   them.

15.  AR and MSE Resilience

   *NETs SHOULD deploy ARs in Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)
   [RFC5798] configurations so that service continuity is maintained
   even if one or more ARs fail.  Using VRRP, the MN is unaware which of
   the (redundant) ARs is currently providing service, and any service
   discontinuity will be limited to the failover time supported by VRRP.
   Widely deployed public domain implementations of VRRP are available.

   MSEs SHOULD use high availability clustering services so that
   multiple redundant systems can provide coordinated response to
   failures.  As with VRRP, widely deployed public domain
   implementations of high availability clustering services are
   available.  Note that special-purpose and expensive dedicated
   hardware is not necessary, and public domain implementations can be
   used even between lightweight virtual machines in cloud deployments.

16.  Detecting and Responding to MSE Failures

   In environments where fast recovery from MSE failure is required, ARs
   SHOULD use proactive Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD) in a
   manner that parallels Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)



Templin & Whyman          Expires July 5, 2021                 [Page 45]

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   [RFC5880] to track MSE reachability.  ARs can then quickly detect and
   react to failures so that cached information is re-established
   through alternate paths.  Proactive NUD control messaging is carried
   only over well-connected ground domain networks (i.e., and not low-
   end *NET links such as aeronautical radios) and can therefore be
   tuned for rapid response.

   ARs perform proactive NUD for MSEs for which there are currently
   active MNs on the *NET.  If an MSE fails, ARs can quickly inform MNs
   of the outage by sending multicast RA messages on the *NET interface.
   The AR sends RA messages to MNs via the *NET interface with an OMNI
   option with a Release ID for the failed MSE, and with destination
   address set to All-Nodes multicast (ff02::1) [RFC4291].

   The AR SHOULD send MAX_FINAL_RTR_ADVERTISEMENTS RA messages separated
   by small delays [RFC4861].  Any MNs on the *NET interface that have
   been using the (now defunct) MSE will receive the RA messages and
   associate with a new MSE.

17.  Transition Considerations

   When a MN connects to an *NET link for the first time, it sends an RS
   message with an OMNI option.  If the first hop AR recognizes the
   option, it returns an RA with its ADM-LLA as the source, the MNP-LLA
   as the destination and with an OMNI option included.  The MN then
   engages the AR according to the OMNI link model specified above.  If
   the first hop AR is a legacy IPv6 router, however, it instead returns
   an RA message with no OMNI option and with a non-OMNI unicast source
   LLA as specified in [RFC4861].  In that case, the MN engages the *NET
   according to the legacy IPv6 link model and without the OMNI
   extensions specified in this document.

   If the *NET link model is multiple access, there must be assurance
   that address duplication cannot corrupt the neighbor caches of other
   nodes on the link.  When the MN sends an RS message on a multiple
   access *NET link with an LLA source address and an OMNI option, ARs
   that recognize the option ensure that the MN is authorized to use the
   address and return an RA with a non-zero Router Lifetime only if the
   MN is authorized.  ARs that do not recognize the option instead
   return an RA that makes no statement about the MN's authorization to
   use the source address.  In that case, the MN should perform
   Duplicate Address Detection to ensure that it does not interfere with
   other nodes on the link.

   An alternative approach for multiple access *NET links to ensure
   isolation for MN / AR communications is through L2 address mappings
   as discussed in Appendix C.  This arrangement imparts a (virtual)
   point-to-point link model over the (physical) multiple access link.

18.  OMNI Interfaces on the Open Internet

   OMNI interfaces configured over IPv6-enabled underlying interfaces on
   the open Internet without an OMNI-aware first-hop AR receive RA
   messages that do not include an OMNI option, while OMNI interfaces
   configured over IPv4-only underlying interfaces do not receive any
   (IPv6) RA messages at all.  OMNI interfaces that receive RA messages
   without an OMNI option configure addresses, on-link prefixes, etc. on
   the underlying interface that received the RA according to standard
   IPv6 ND and address resolution conventions [RFC4861] [RFC4862].  OMNI
   interfaces configured over IPv4-only underlying interfaces configure
   IPv4 address information on the underlying interfaces using
   mechanisms such as DHCPv4 [RFC2131].

   OMNI interfaces configured over underlying interfaces that connect to
   the open Internet can apply security services such as VPNs to connect
   to an MSE, or can establish a direct link to an MSE through some
   other means (see Section 4).  In environments where an explicit VPN
   or direct link may be impractical, OMNI interfaces can instead use
   UDP/IP encapsulation and HMAC-based message authentication per
   [RFC6081][RFC4380].

   After establishing a VPN or preparing for UDP/IP encapsulation, OMNI
   interfaces send control plane messages to interface with the MS,
   including RS/RA messages used according to Section 13 and Neighbor
   Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages used for
   address resolution / route optimization (see:
   [I-D.templin-intarea-6706bis]).  The control plane messages must be
   authenticated while data plane messages are delivered the same as for
   ordinary best-effort Internet traffic with basic source address-based
   data origin verification.  Data plane communications via OMNI
   interfaces that connect over the open Internet without an explicit
   VPN should therefore employ transport- or higher-layer security to
   ensure integrity and/or confidentiality.

   OMNI interfaces in the open Internet are often located behind NATs.
   The OMNI interface accommodates NAT traversal using UDP/IP
   encapsulation and the mechanisms discussed in
   [RFC6081][RFC4380][I-D.templin-intarea-6706bis].

19.  Time-Varying MNPs

   In some use cases, it is desirable, beneficial and efficient for the
   MN to receive a constant MNP that travels with the MN wherever it
   moves.  For example, this would allow air traffic controllers to
   easily track aircraft, etc.  In other cases, however (e.g.,
   intelligent transportation systems), the MN may be willing to




Templin & Whyman          Expires July 5, 2021                 [Page 47]

Internet-Draft          IPv6 over OMNI Interfaces           January 2021


   sacrifice a modicum of efficiency in order to have time-varying MNPs
   that can be changed every so often to defeat adversarial tracking.

   The prefix delegation services discussed in Section 13.3 allows OMNI
   MNs that desire time-varying MNPs to obtain short-lived prefixes to
   use a Temporary LLA as the source address of an RS message with an
   OMNI option with DHCPv6 Option sub-options.  The MN would then be
   obligated to renumber its internal networks whenever its MNP (and
   therefore also its OMNI address) changes.  This should not present a
   challenge for MNs with automated network renumbering services,
   however presents limits for the durations of ongoing sessions that
   would prefer to use a constant address.

20.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is instructed to allocate an official Type number TBD from
   the registry "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option Formats" for the OMNI
   option.  Implementations set Type to 253 as an interim value
   [RFC4727].

   The IANA is instructed to assign a new Code value "1" in the "ICMPv6
   Code Fields: Type 2 - Packet Too Big" registry.  The registry should
   read as follows:

      Code      Name                         Reference
      ---       ----                         ---------
      0         Diagnostic Packet Too Big    [RFC4443]
      1         Advisory Packet Too Big      [RFCXXXX]

       Figure 17: ICMPv6 Code Fields: Type 2 - Packet Too Big Values

   The IANA is instructed to allocate one Ethernet unicast address TBD2
   (suggest 00-00-5E-00-52-14 [RFC5214]) in the registry "IANA Ethernet
   Address Block - Unicast Use".

   The OMNI option also defines an 8-bit Sub-Type field, for which IANA
   is instructed to create and maintain a new registry entitled "OMNI
   option Sub-Type values".  Initial values for the OMNI option Sub-Type
   values registry are given below; future assignments are to be made
   through Expert Review [RFC8126].

21.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for IPv4 [RFC0791], IPv6 [RFC8200] and IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] apply.  OMNI interface IPv6 ND messages
   SHOULD include Nonce and Timestamp options [RFC3971] when transaction
   confirmation and/or time synchronization is needed.

   OMNI interfaces configured over secured ANET interfaces inherit the
   physical and/or link-layer security properties (i.e., "protected
   spectrum") of the connected ANETs.  OMNI interfaces configured over
   open INET interfaces can use symmetric securing services such as VPNs
   or can by some other means establish a direct link.  When a VPN or
   direct link may be impractical, however, an asymmetric security
   service such as the authentication option specified in [RFC4380] or
   other protocol control message security mechanisms may be necessary.
   While the OMNI link protects control plane messaging, applications
   must still employ end-to-end transport- or higher-layer security
   services to protect the data plane.

   The Mobility Service MUST provide strong network layer security for
   control plane messages and forwarding path integrity for data plane
   messages.  In one example, the AERO service
   [I-D.templin-intarea-6706bis] constructs a spanning tree between
   mobility service elements and secures the links in the spanning tree
   with network layer security mechanisms such as IPsec [RFC4301] or
   Wireguard.  Control plane messages are then constrained to travel
   only over the secured spanning tree paths and are therefore protected
   from attack or eavesdropping.  Since data plane messages can travel
   over route optimized paths that do not strictly follow the spanning

   tree, however, end-to-end transport- or higher-layer security
   services are still required.

   Security considerations for specific access network interface types
   are covered under the corresponding IP-over-(foo) specification
   (e.g., [RFC2464], [RFC2492], etc.).

   Security considerations for IPv6 fragmentation and reassembly are
   discussed in Section 5.1.

22.  Implementation Status

   Draft -29 is implemented in the recently tagged AERO/OMNI 3.0.0
   internal release, and Draft -30 is now tagged as the AERO/OMNI 3.0.1.
   Newer specification versions will be tagged in upcoming releases.

Appendix A.  Interface Attribute Preferences Bitmap Encoding

   Adaptation of the OMNI option Interface Attributes Preferences Bitmap
   encoding to specific Internetworks such as the Aeronautical
   Telecommunications Network with Internet Protocol Services (ATN/IPS)
   may include link selection preferences based on other traffic
   classifiers (e.g., transport port numbers, etc.) in addition to the
   existing DSCP-based preferences.  Nodes on specific Internetworks
   maintain a map of traffic classifiers to additional P[*] preference
   fields beyond the first 64.  For example, TCP port 22 maps to P[67],
   TCP port 443 maps to P[70], UDP port 8060 maps to P[76], etc.

   Implementations use Simplex or Indexed encoding formats for P[*]
   encoding in order to encode a given set of traffic classifiers in the
   most efficient way.  Some use cases may be more efficiently coded
   using Simplex form, while others may be more efficient using Indexed.
   Once a format is selected for preparation of a single Interface
   Attribute the same format must be used for the entire Interface
   Attribute sub-option.  Different sub-options may use different
   formats.

   The following figures show coding examples for various Simplex and
   Indexed formats:

Appendix B.  VDL Mode 2 Considerations

   ICAO Doc 9776 is the "Technical Manual for VHF Data Link Mode 2"
   (VDLM2) that specifies an essential radio frequency data link service
   for aircraft and ground stations in worldwide civil aviation air
   traffic management.  The VDLM2 link type is "multicast capable"
   [RFC4861], but with considerable differences from common multicast
   links such as Ethernet and IEEE 802.11.

   First, the VDLM2 link data rate is only 31.5Kbps - multiple orders of
   magnitude less than most modern wireless networking gear.  Second,
   due to the low available link bandwidth only VDLM2 ground stations
   (i.e., and not aircraft) are permitted to send broadcasts, and even
   so only as compact layer 2 "beacons".  Third, aircraft employ the
   services of ground stations by performing unicast RS/RA exchanges
   upon receipt of beacons instead of listening for multicast RA
   messages and/or sending multicast RS messages.

   This beacon-oriented unicast RS/RA approach is necessary to conserve
   the already-scarce available link bandwidth.  Moreover, since the
   numbers of beaconing ground stations operating within a given spatial
   range must be kept as sparse as possible, it would not be feasible to
   have different classes of ground stations within the same region
   observing different protocols.  It is therefore highly desirable that
   all ground stations observe a common language of RS/RA as specified
   in this document.

   Note that links of this nature may benefit from compression
   techniques that reduce the bandwidth necessary for conveying the same
   amount of data.  The IETF lpwan working group is considering possible
   alternatives: [https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/lpwan/documents].

Appendix C.  MN / AR Isolation Through L2 Address Mapping

   Per [RFC4861], IPv6 ND messages may be sent to either a multicast or
   unicast link-scoped IPv6 destination address.  However, IPv6 ND
   messaging should be coordinated between the MN and AR only without
   invoking other nodes on the *NET.  This implies that MN / AR control
   messaging should be isolated and not overheard by other nodes on the
   link.

   To support MN / AR isolation on some *NET links, ARs can maintain an
   OMNI-specific unicast L2 address ("MSADDR").  For Ethernet-compatible
   *NETs, this specification reserves one Ethernet unicast address TBD2
   (see: Section 20).  For non-Ethernet statically-addressed *NETs,
   MSADDR is reserved per the assigned numbers authority for the *NET
   addressing space.  For still other *NETs, MSADDR may be dynamically
   discovered through other means, e.g., L2 beacons.

   MNs map the L3 addresses of all IPv6 ND messages they send (i.e.,
   both multicast and unicast) to MSADDR instead of to an ordinary
   unicast or multicast L2 address.  In this way, all of the MN's IPv6
   ND messages will be received by ARs that are configured to accept
   packets destined to MSADDR.  Note that multiple ARs on the link could
   be configured to accept packets destined to MSADDR, e.g., as a basis
   for supporting redundancy.

   Therefore, ARs must accept and process packets destined to MSADDR,
   while all other devices must not process packets destined to MSADDR.
   This model has well-established operational experience in Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 (PMIP) [RFC5213][RFC6543].
