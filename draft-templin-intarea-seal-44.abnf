I=1 and writes a monotonically-increasing integer value for this ETE
RATE_LIMIT=TRUE, the ITE sends the packet subject to rate limiting so
PMTU=2KB.  If the ITE subsequently receives a PTB message with MTU==0
PMTU=(1500+HLEN).  If the ITE is performing stateful MTU
I=1 (when USE_ID is TRUE), then finally calculates the ICV and sets
V=1(when USE_ICV is TRUE).

RATE_LIMIT=TRUE.  Otherwise, the ITE instead examines the SPTB
