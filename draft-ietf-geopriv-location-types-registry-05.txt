Abstract

   This document creates a registry for describing the types of places a
   human or end system might be found.  The registry is then referenced
   by other protocols that need a common set of location terms as
   protocol constants.  Examples of location terms defined in this
   document include aircraft, office and train station.

Internet-Draft           Location Types Registry              March 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document creates a registry for location type tokens.  We
   anticipate that the network, through configuration or management
   protocols, tells a mobile device what kind of location it finds
   itself in.  The device and associated software can then tailor its
   behavior to the environment.  For example, this document defines the
   terms "classroom", "place-of-worship" and "theater".  A considerate
   owner of a cell phone might program the device to switch from ringer
   to vibrate mode in such environments.  Just knowing the geographic
   location, be it as civic (street address) or geospatial coordinates
   would generally not allow the device to make a similar decision.

   Naturally, the number of descriptive terms for physical environments
   is almost unbounded.  This registry tries to identify common terms
   that are likely to be useful for communications devices and for
   controlling and guiding communication behavior.  The terms roughly
   correspond to the level of details of location descriptions and icons
   found on geographic maps, for example, and are meant to be in common
   use across a variety of cultures and countries.  The registration
   process described in the IANA Considerations section allows to extend
   this list as needed, while aiming to prevent an unnecessary explosion
   in the registry.

   The use of tokens, i.e., protocol constants, makes it easier to build
   systems across multiple languages.  A user interface can readily
   translate a finite set of tokens to user-appropriate textual or
   iconic representations.  Protocols using this registry are encouraged
   to provide additional mechanisms to accommodate location types not
   currently registered via free-text fields with appropriate language
   and character set labeling.

   The terms defined in this registry do not attempt to provide a
   hierarchy of location descriptions, except in certain special cases.
   For example, the term "restaurant" is defined to include the term
   "cafe" and the term "public" encompasses a range of descriptors, as
   noted below.  The registry makes these more generic terms available
   as often the more detailed distinctions may not be available, or
   privacy concerns suggest the use of less precise terms that are still
   sufficient to guide communications behavior or evaluate the source of
   a phone call or message, say.

   In many cases, a location might be described by multiple terms that
   apply at the same time.  For example, the combination of "restaurant"
   and "airport" is immediately recognizable.  This registry makes no
   attempt to limit the number of terms that can be used to describe a
   single place or to restrict what combinations are allowed, given that
   there are few combinations that are physically impossible.  Common

   sense is probably a better guide here; the authors would not want to
   rule out creative business models such as combinations of "parking"
   and "restaurant" or "bar" and "hospital".  The number of terms that
   can be used within the same protocol element is left to the protocol
   description.

   This document does not describe how the values of the registry are to
   be used, as this description is provided by other documents.  For
   example, [4], describes a options for carrying civic address
   information, including the place-type attributes listed in this
   document, using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4 and
   DHCPv6).  A usage for RADIUS is described in [5], where this
   information is conveyed from the RADIUS client to the RADIUS server.
   Rich presence (RPID [6]) also utilizes the values of the location
   type registry.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates new IANA registries for location types as
   listed in Section 3 starting with 'aircraft' and finishing with
   'watercraft'.

   Following the policies outline in RFC 2434 [2], new tokens are
   assigned after Expert Review by the IETF GEOPRIV working group or its
   designated successor.  The same procedure applies to updates of
   tokens within the registry and to deleting tokens from the registry.
   There are no restrictions regarding the update of location-type
   values in the registry.

   The expert review should be guided by a few common-sense
   considerations.  For example, tokens should not be specific to a
   country, region, organization or company, should be well-defined and
   should be widely recognized.

   To ensure widespread usability across protocols, tokens MUST follow
   the character set restrictions for XML Names [3].

   Each registration must include the name of the token and a brief
   description similar to the ones offered in for the initial
   registrations contained this document:

   Token Identifier: Identifier of the token.

   Description: Brief description indicating the meaning of the token,
      including one or more examples where the term encompasses several
      more precise terms.

   Note that the usage of these tokens is not limited to XML and the
   'Token Identifier' is the XML element content and not the XML element
   name.

5.  Internationalization Considerations

   The location-type values listed in this document MUST NOT be
   presented to the user.  The values therefore have the characteristic
   of tokens or tags and no internationalization support is required.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a registry for location types and as such does
   not raise security issues.

7.  Acknowledgements

   We would like to thank V. Gurbani, P. Kyzivat and J. Rosenberg for
   their work on RPID [6] which lead to the location types listed in
   this document.  Many thanks to Allison Mankin for her guidance.  Rick
   Jones pointed us to the Global Justice XML work (see
   http://it.ojp.gov/jxdm/) that helped us to add more values to the
   location registry.

   During the IETF last call, Harald Tveit Alvestrand, Frank Ellermann
   and Sam Hartman provided useful feedback.  David Kessens helped to
   tighten up many of the defintions.

   Some of the definitions are derived from the Merriam-Webster Online
   Dictionary.
