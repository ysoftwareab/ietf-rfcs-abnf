2.  Terminology

2.1.  Required Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.2.  Definitions

   See [drip-requirements] for common DRIP terms.

   HDA:  Hierarchial HIT Domain Authority.  The 16 bit field identifying
      the HIT Domain Authority under a RAA.

   HID:  Hierarchy ID.  The 32 bit field providing the HIT Hierarchy ID.

   RAA:  Registered Assigning Authority.  The 16 bit field identifying
      the Hierarchical HIT Assigning Authority.

3.  Claims, Assertions, Attestations & Certificates

   This section introduces the terms "Claims", "Assertions",
   "Attestations", and "Certificates" as used in DRIP.  In DRIP
   certificate has a different context compared with security
   certificates and Public Key Infrastructure used in X.509.

   Claims:

      A claim in DRIP is a predicate (e.g., "X is Y", "X has property
      Y", and most importantly "X owns Y" or "X is owned by Y").

   Assertions:

      An assertion in DRIP is a set of claims.  This definition is
      borrowed from JWT [RFC7519] and CWT [RFC8392].

   Attestations:

      An attestation in DRIP is a signed assertion.  The signer may be
      the claimant or a related party with stake in the assertion(s).
      Under DRIP this is normally used when an entity asserts a
      relationship with another entity, along with other information,
      and the asserting entity signs the assertion, thereby making it an
      attestation.

   Certificates:

      A certificate in DRIP is an attestation, strictly over identity
      information, signed by a third party.  This third party should be
      one with no stake in the attestation(s) its signing over.

4.  DRIP Attestations & Certificates

4.1.  Attestation Structure

   All Attestations and Certificates under DRIP share the following
   format:

    0                   1                   2                   3

                      Figure 1: Attestation Structure

4.1.1.  Attestor Identity Information

   This can be any one of the following:

   1.  None

   2.  Attestor HHIT: 16-bytes

   3.  Attestor SelfAttestation: 120-bytes

   A specific definition of an Attestation or Certificate defines which
   of these are used.

   Two Attestation's remove this field: MutualAttestation Section 4.2.4
   and LinkAttestation Section 4.2.5 as their definition clearly states
   that the signer is the second party with their HHIT or
   SelfAttestation already embedded in the Attestation Data.

4.1.2.  Attestation Data

   The data being attested to.  It can be one of the following forms:

   1.  Claims

   2.  Assertions

   3.  Attestations

   An attestation that perform a sign over an existing Attestation where
   the signer is the second party of the embedded attestation.

   This Attestation is one of two that does not fill in the "Attestor
   Identity Information" (Section 4.1.1) as the data is already present
   in the "Attestation Data" (Section 4.1.2) in the form of Y's
   SelfAttestation.

4.2.5.  Link Attestation (LA-xy)

   An attestations that perform a sign over an existing
   ConciseAttestation where the signer is the second party of the
   embedded attestation.

   This Attestation is one of two that does not fill in the "Attestor
   Identity Information" (Section 4.1.1) as the data is already present
   in the "Attestation Data" (Section 4.1.2) in the form of Y's HHIT.

4.3.  Certificates

   In DRIP certificates are signed by a third party that has no stake in
   the claims/assertions/attestations being attested to.

   It is analogous to a third party in legal system that signs a
   document as a "witness" and bears no responsibility in the document.

5.  Registries

5.1.  Classes

   Under DRIP there 3 classes of registries, with specific variants in
   each.

Internet-Draft                 registries                   October 2021


5.1.1.  Root

   This is a special registry holding the RAA value of 0 and HDA value
   of 0.  It delegates out RAA values only to registries that wish to
   act as an RAA.

   (Editors Note: we contemplate this is ICAO running this server or
   federation of them)

5.1.2.  Registered Assigning Authorities

   TODO

   Hold RAA values of 2+ and HDA value of 0.

   Most are contemplated to be Civil Aviation Authorities (CAAs) then
   delegate HDAs to manage their NAS.

5.1.2.1.  ICAO Registry of Manufacturer's (IRM)

   A special registry that hands out HDA values to participating
   Manufacturer's that hold an ICAO Manufacturer Code used in ANSI
   CTA2063-A Serial Numbers.

   It is holds the RAA value of 1 and HDA value of 0.

   (Editors Note: we contemplate this is ICAO running this server or
   federation of them)

5.1.3.  Hierarchial HIT Domain Authorities

5.1.3.1.  Manufacturer's Registry of Aircraft (MRA)

   A registry run by a manufacturer of UAS systems that participate in
   Remote ID.  Stores UAS Serial Numbers under a specific ICAO
   Manufacturer Code (assigned to the manufacturer by ICAO).

   A DET can be encoded into a Serial Number (Editor Note: link to -uas-
   rid) and when done so this registry would hold a mapping from the
   Serial Number to the DET and its artifacts.

   Hold RAA values of 1 and HDA value of 1+.

5.1.3.2.  Remote ID Registries (RIDR)

   Registry that holds the binding between a UAS Session ID (for DRIP
   the DET) and the UA Serial Number.  The Serial Number MUST have its
   access protected to allow only authorized parties to obtain.  The
   Serial Number SHOULD be encrypted in a way the authorized party can
   decrypt.

   As part of the UTM system they also hold a binding between a UAS ID
   (Serial Number or Session ID) and an Operational Intent.

   (Editors Note: these are contemplated to be part of a USS as a
   function or a standalone SDSP in the UTM system)

   Hold RAA values of 2+ and HDA value of 1+.

5.2.  Federation

   (Editors Note: Due to nature of HHIT we could have multiple
   registries with same RAA/HDA pairings running and being federated
   together.  How do we handle this?)

6.  DRIP Fully Qualified Domain Names

   Under DRIP there are a number of FQDN forms used to allow lookups to
   take place.

6.1.  Serial Number

   Serial Number: 8653FZ2T7B8RA85D19LX
   ICAO Mfr Code: 8653
   Length Code: F
   ID: FZ2T7B8RA85D19LX
   FQDN: Z2T7B8RA85D19LX.F.8653.mfr.remoteid.aero

6.2.  DET

   DET: 2001:0030:00a0:0145:a3ad:1952:0ad0:a69e
   ID: a3ad:1952:0ad0:a69e
   OGA: 5
   HDA: 0014 = 20
   RAA: 000a = 10
   FQDN: a3ad19520ad0a69e.5.20.10.det.remoteid.aero

   (Editors Note: do we want to convert HDA/RAA to int or leave as hex?)

   (Editors Note: DNS is case-sensitive in my experience, do we do all
   upper case?)

   (Editors Note: do we support condensed ipv6 forms? - instinct is no
   as dns case-sensitive so it would be considered a different fqdn

   DRIP requires a number of resource records, some specific to certain
   registries to function.

7.1.  HIP RR

   All registries will have their own DET associated with them and their
   respective DNS server will hold a HIP RR that is pointed to by their
   DET FQDN.

   MRA and RIDR servers will also have HIP RRs for their registered
   parties (aircraft and operators).

7.2.  CERT RR

   Most attestations can be placed into DNS.  An exception to this is
   the AttestationCertificate made during Session ID registration.

7.3.  NS RR

   Along with their associated "glue" record (A/AAAA) supports the
   traversal in DNS across the tree.

   1.  "<mfr.remoteid.aero>" on Root points to specific DET FQDN of IRM

   2.  "<icao_mfr_code>.mfr.remoteid.aero" on IRM points to specific DET
       FQDN of MRA

   3.  "<raa_value>.det.remoteid.aero" on Root pointing to DET FQDN of
       matching RAA

   4.  "<hda_value>.<raa_value>.det.remoteid.aero" on RAA Registry
       pointing to DET FQDN of matching HDA

7.4.  AAAA RR

   DRIP requires the use of IPv6.

9.  Provisioning

   Under DRIP UAS RID a special provisioning procedure is required to
   properly generate and distribute the certificates and attestations to
   all parties in the USS/UTM ecosystem using DRIP RID.

   Keypairs are expected to be generated on the device hardware it will
   be used on.  Due to hardware limitations (see Section 10) and
   connectivity it is acceptable under DRIP RID to generate keypairs for
   the Aircraft on Operator devices and later securely inject them into
   the Aircraft (as defined in Section 9.6.2).  The methods to securely
   inject and store keypair information in a "secure element" of the
   Aircraft is out of scope of this document.

9.1.  Overview of Transactions

   In DRIP, each Operator MUST generate a Host Identity of the Operator
   (HIo) and derived Hierarchical HIT of the Operator (HHITo).  These
   are registered with a Private Information Registry along with
   whatever Operator data (inc.  PII) is required by the cognizant CAA
   and the registry.  In response, the Operator will obtain an
   attestation from the Registry, Attestation: Registry on Operator
   (A-ro), signed with the Host Identity of the Registry private key
   (HIr(priv)) proving such registration.

   An Operator may now claim one or more UA.

   *  An Operator MUST generate a Host Identity of the Aircraft (HIa)
      and derived Hierarchical HIT of the Aircraft (HHITa)

   *  Create an attestation from the Operator on the Aircraft (A-oa)
      signed with the Host Identity of the Operator private key
      (HIo(priv)) to associate the UA with its Operator

   *  Register them with a Private Information Registry along with
      whatever UAS data is required by the cognizant CAA and Registry

   *  Obtain an attestation from the Registry on the Operator and
      Aircraft ("AC-roa") signed with the HIr(priv) proving such
      registration

   *  And obtain a broadcast attestation from the Registry on the
      Aircraft (BA-ra) signed with HIr(priv) proving UA registration in
      that specific registry while preserving Operator privacy.

Internet-Draft                 registries                   October 2021


   The operator then MUST provision the UA with HIa, HIa(priv), HHITa
   and B-Ara.

   *  UA engaging in Broadcast RID MUST use HIa(priv) to sign
      Authentication Messages and MUST periodically broadcast BA-ra.

   *  UAS engaging in Network RID MUST use HIa(priv) to sign
      Authentication Messages.

   *  Observers MUST use HIa from received BA-ra to verify received
      Broadcast RID Authentication messages.

   *  Observers without Internet connectivity MAY use BA-ra to identify
      the trust class of the UAS based on known registry vetting.

   *  Observers with Internet connectivity MAY use HHITa to perform
      lookups in the Public Information Registry and MAY then query the
      Private Information Registry which MUST enforce AAA policy on
      Operator PII and other sensitive information

9.2.  HHIT Delegation

   Under the FAA [NPRM], it is expecting that IDs for UAS are assigned
   by the UTM and are generally one-time use.  The methods for this
   however are unspecified leaving two options.

   1  The entity generates its own HHIT, discovering and using thr RAA
      and HDA for the target Registry.  The method for discovering a
      Registry's RAA and HDA is out of scope here.  This allows for the
      device to generate an HHIT to send to the Registry to be accepted
      (thus generating the required Host Identity Claim) or denied.

   2  The entity sends to the Registry its HI for it to be hashed and
      result in the HHIT.  The Registry would then either accept
      (returning the HHIT to the device) or deny this pairing.

   In either case the Registry must decide on if the HI/HHIT pairing is
   valid.  This in its simplest form is checking the current Registry
   for a collision on the HHIT.

   Upon accepting a HI/HHIT pair the Registry MUST populate the required
   the DNS serving the HDA with the HIP RR and other relevant RR types
   (such as TXT and CERT).  The Registry MUST also generate the
   appropriate Attestation for the given operation.

   If the Registry denied the HI/HHIT pair, because there was a HHIT
   collision or any other reason, the Registry MUST signal back to the
   device being provisioned that a new HI needs to be generated.

9.3.  Registry

   (Editor Note: this should break down the individual registrations
   between Root/RAA, RAA/HDA and their special variants).

   TODO

   DRIP UAS RID defines two levels of hierarchy maintained by the
   Registration Assigning Authority (RAA) and HHIT Domain Authority
   (HDA).  The authors anticipate that an RAA is owned and operated by a
   regional CAA (or a delegated party by an CAA in a specific airspace
   region) with HDAs being contracted out.  As such a chain of trust for
   registries is required to ensure trustworthiness is not compromised.
   More information on the registries can be found in [hhit-registries].

   Both the RAA and HDA generate their own keypairs and self-signed
   attestations (SelfAttestation: RAA on RAA and SelfAttestation: HDA on
   HDA respectively).  The HDA sends to the RAA its self-signed
   attestation to be added into the RAA DNS.

   The RAA confirms the attestation received is valid and that no HHIT
   collisions occur before added a HIP RR to its DNS for the new HDA.
   An Attestation: RAA on HDA (A-rh) is sent as a confirmation that
   provisioning was successful.

   The HDA is now a valid "Registry" and uses its keypair and
   SelfAttestation: HDA on HDA (SA-hh) with all provisioning requests
   from downstream.

   During the initial configuration and production at the factory the
   Aircraft MUST be configured to have a serial number.  ASTM defines
   this to be an ANSI/CTA-2063A.  Under DRIP a HHIT can be encoded as
   such to be able to convert back and forth between them.  This is out
   of scope for this document.  TODO: link from UAS RID document.

   Under DRIP the Manufacturer SHOULD be using HHITs and have their own
   keypair and SA-mm (SelfAttestation: Manufacturer on Manufacturer).
   (Ed.  Note: some words on aircraft keypair and certs here?).

   SelfAttestation: Aircraft 0 on Aircraft 0 (SA-a0a0) is extracted by
   the manufacturer and sent to their Certificate Authority (CA) to be
   verified and added.  A resulting attestation (Attestation:
   Manufacturer on Aircraft 0 [A-ma0]) SHOULD be a DRIP Attestation -
   however this could be a X.509 certificate binding the serial number
   to the manufacturer.

   The Operator generates a keypair and HHIT as specified in DRIP UAS
   RID.  A self-signed attestation (Attestation: Operator on Operator
   [SA-oo]) is generated and sent to the desired Registry (HDA).  Other
   relevant information and possibly personally identifiable information
   needed may also be required to be sent to the Registry (all over a
   secure channel - the method of which is out of scope for this
   document).

   The Registry cross checks any personally identifiable information as
   required.  Certificate: Operator on Operator is verified (both using
   the expiration timestamp and signature).  The HHIT is searched in the
   Registries database to confirm that no collision occurs.  A new
   attestation is generated (Attestation: Registry on Operator) and sent
   securely back to the Operator.  Optionally the HHIT/HI pairing can be

   added to the Registries DNS in to form of a HIP Resource Record (RR).
   Other RRs, such as CERT and TXT, may also be used to hold public
   information.

   With the receipt of Attestation: Registry on Operator (A-ro) the
   provisioning of an Operator is complete.

   Through mechanisms not specified in this document the Aircraft should
   have methods to instruct the Aircraft onboard systems to generate a
   keypair and certificate.  This certificate is chained to the factory
   provisioned certificate (SelfAttestation: Aircraft 0 on Aircraft 0
   [SA-a0a0]).  This new attestation (Attestation: Aircraft 0 on
   Aircraft N [A-a0aN]) is securely extracted by the Operator.

   With A-a0aN the sub-attestation (SelfAttestation: Aircraft N on
   Aircraft N [SA-aNaN]) is used by the Operator to generate
   Attestation: Operator on Aircraft N (A-oaN).  This along with
   Attestation: Registry on Operator (A-ro) is sent to the Registry.

   Upon receipt of this token, the Operator injects it into the Aircraft
   and its used to form a secure connection to the Registry.  The
   Aircraft then sends Attestation: Manufacturer on Aircraft 0 (A-ma0)

   The Registry uses Attestation: Manufacturer on Aircraft 0 (with an
   external database if supported) to confirm the validity of the
   Aircraft.  Attestation: Aircraft 0 on Aircraft N is correlated with
   Attestation: Operator on Aircraft N and Attestation: Manufacturer on
   Aircraft 0 to see the chain of ownership.  The new HHIT tied to
   Aircraft N is then checked for collisions in the HDA.  With the
   information the Registry generates two items: AttestationCertificate:
   Registry on Operator on Aircraft N (AC-roaN) and
   BroadcastAttestation: Registry on Aircraft N (BA-raN).  A HIP RR (and
   other RR types as needed) are generated and inserted into the HDA.

   AC-roaN is sent via a secure channel back to the Operator to be
   stored.  ABA-raN is sent to the Aircraft to be used in Broadcast RID
   as specified in (Editors Note: add link to -auth-formats).

9.6.2.  Operator Assisted Provisioning

   This provisioning scheme is for when the Aircraft is unable to
   connect to the Registry itself or does not have the hardware required
   to generate keypairs and certificates.

               Figure 17: Operator Assisted Provision: Step 1

   To start the Operator generates on behalf of the Aircraft a new
   keypair and Attestation: Aircraft N on Aircraft N (SA-aNaN).  This
   keypair and certificate are injected into the Aircraft for it to
   generate Attestation: Aircraft 0 on Aircraft N (A-a0aN).  After
   injecting the keypair and certificate, the Operator MUST destroy all
   copies of the keypair.

   On the Registry validation checks are done on all attestations as per
   the previous sections.  Once complete then the Registry checks for a
   HHIT collision, adding to the HDA if clear and generates
   AttestationCertificate: Registry on Operator on Aircraft N (AC-roaN)
   and BroadcastAttestation: Registry on Aircraft N (BA-raN).  Both are
   sent back to the Operator.

   The Operator securely inject BA-raN and securely stores AC-roaN of
   Aircraft N.

9.6.3.  Initial Provisioning

   A special form of provisioning is used when the Aircraft is first
   sold to an Operator.  Instead of generating a new keypair, the built
   in keypair and certificate done by the Manufacturer is used to
   provision and register the aircraft to the owner.

   For this either Standard or Operator Assisted methods can be used.
