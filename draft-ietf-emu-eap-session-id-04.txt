        EAP Session-Id Derivation for EAP-SIM, EAP-AKA, and PEAP
                  draft-ietf-emu-eap-session-id-04.txt

Abstract

   EAP Session-Id derivation has not been defined for EAP-SIM or EAP-AKA
   when using the fast re-authentication exchange instead of full
   authentication.  This document updates RFC 5247 to define those
   derivations for EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA.  RFC 5247 also does not define
   Session-Id derivation for PEAP.  A definition is given here which
   follows the definition for other TLS-based EAP methods.

INTERNET-DRAFT          EAP Session-ID Derivation            27 May 2020


1.  Introduction

   EAP [RFC3748] Session-Id derivation has not been defined for EAP-SIM
   and EAP-AKA when using the fast re-authentication exchange instead of
   full authentication.  [RFC5247] defines the Session-Id for these EAP
   methods, but that derivation is only applicable for the full
   authentication case.  The Session-Id derivation was not defined for
   EAP-AKA', but [AKAP] now defines it, along with other updates.  As
   such, the definition for EAP-AKA' is not included here.

   The IEEE is defining FILS authentication [FILS], which needs the EAP
   Session-Id in order for the EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP)
   [RFC6696] to work.  It is therefore important to address the existing
   deficiencies in the definition of EAP Session-Id.

   Further, [RFC5247] did not define Session-Id for PEAP. We correct
   these deficiencies here by updating [RFC5247] with the Session-Id
   derivation during fast-authentication exchange for EAP-SIM and EAP-
   AKA; and defining Session-Id derivation for PEAP.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Updates to RFC 5247 Appendix A

   This section updates [RFC5247] Appendix A to define Session-Id for
   fast re-authentication exchange for EAP-AKA and EAP-SIM.  It further
   defines Session-ID derivation for PEAP.

2.1.  EAP-AKA

   For EAP-AKA, [RFC5247] Appendix A says:

   EAP-AKA

      EAP-AKA is defined in [RFC4187].  The EAP-AKA Session-Id is the
      concatenation of the EAP Type Code (0x17) with the contents of the
      RAND field from the AT_RAND attribute, followed by the contents of
      the AUTN field in the AT_AUTN attribute:

      Session-Id = 0x17 || RAND || AUTN


   It should say:

   EAP-AKA

      EAP-AKA is defined in [RFC4187].  When using full authentication,
      the EAP-AKA Session-Id is the concatenation of the EAP Type Code
      (0x17) with the contents of the RAND field from the AT_RAND
      attribute, followed by the contents of the AUTN field in the
      AT_AUTN attribute:

      Session-Id = 0x17 || RAND || AUTN

      When using fast re-authentication, the EAP-AKA Session-Id is the
      concatenation of the EAP Type Code (0x17) with the contents of the
      NONCE_S field from the AT_NONCE_S attribute, followed by the
      contents of the MAC field from the AT_MAC attribute from EAP-
      Request/AKA-Reauthentication:

      Session-Id = 0x17 || NONCE_S || MAC

2.2.  EAP-SIM

   Similarly for EAP-SIM, [RFC5247] Appendix A says:

   EAP-SIM

      EAP-SIM is defined in [RFC4186].  The EAP-SIM Session-Id is the
      concatenation of the EAP Type Code (0x12) with the contents of the



DeKok, Alan                 Proposed Standard                   [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT          EAP Session-ID Derivation            27 May 2020


      RAND field from the AT_RAND attribute, followed by the contents of
      the NONCE_MT field in the AT_NONCE_MT attribute:

      Session-Id = 0x12 || RAND || NONCE_MT

      The Peer-Id is the contents of the Identity field from the
      AT_IDENTITY attribute, using only the Actual Identity Length
      octets from the beginning, however.  Note that the contents are
      used as they are transmitted, regardless of whether the
      transmitted identity was a permanent, pseudonym, or fast EAP re-
      authentication identity.  The Server-Id is the null string (zero
      length).

   It should say:


   EAP-SIM

      EAP-SIM is defined in [RFC4186].  When using full authentication,
      the EAP-SIM Session-Id is the concatenation of the EAP Type Code
      (0x12) with the contents of the RAND field from the AT_RAND
      attribute, followed by the contents of the NONCE_MT field in the
      AT_NONCE_MT attribute.  RFC 4186 says that EAP server should
      obtain "n" GSM triplets where "n=2" or "n=3".

      For "n=2", the Session-Id is therefore defined as

      Session-Id = 0x12 || RAND1 || RAND2 || NONCE_MT

      which is 49 octets in length.

      For "n=3", the Session-Id is therefore defined as

      Session-Id = 0x12 || RAND1 || RAND2 || RAND3 || NONCE_MT

      which is 65 octets in length.

      Where RAND1, RAND2 and RAND3 correspond to the RAND value from the
      first, second and third GSM triplet respectively.

      The Peer-Id is the contents of the Identity field from the
      AT_IDENTITY attribute, using only the Actual Identity Length
      octets from the beginning, however.  Note that the contents are
      used as they are transmitted, regardless of whether the
      transmitted identity was a permanent, pseudonym, or fast EAP re-
      authentication identity.  The Server-Id is the null string (zero
      length).




DeKok, Alan                 Proposed Standard                   [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT          EAP Session-ID Derivation            27 May 2020


      When using fast re-authentication, the EAP-SIM Session-Id is the
      concatenation of the EAP Type Code (0x12) with the contents of the
      NONCE_S field from the AT_NONCE_S attribute, followed by the
      contents of the MAC field from the AT_MAC attribute from EAP-
      Request/AKA-Reauthentication:

      Session-Id = 0x12 || NONCE_S || MAC

      which is 33 octets in length.

2.3.  Rationale for EAP-AKA and EAP-SIM updates

   [RFC5247] was supposed to define exported parameters for existing EAP
   methods in Appendix A. The way Session-Id was defined for EAP-AKA and
   EAP-SIM works only for the full authentication case, i.e., it cannot
   be used when the optional fast re-authentication case is used since
   the used parameters (RAND, AUTN, NONCE_MT) are not used in the fast
   re-authentication case. Based on [RFC4187] Section 5.2, and similar
   text in [RFC4186], NONCE_S corresponds to RAND and MAC in EAP-
   Request/AKA-Reauthentication corresponds to AUTN. That would seem to
   imply that the Session-Id could be defined using NONCE_S and MAC
   instead of RAND and AUTN/NONCE_MT.

3.  Session-Id for PEAP

   [RFC5247] did not define Session-Id definition for Microsoft's
   Protected EAP (PEAP).  For consistency with EAP-TLS the definition
   given in [RFC5216] Section 2.3, we define it as:

      Session-Id = 0x19 || client.random || server.random

   This definition is already in wide-spread use in multiple PEAP
   implementations.

   Note that this definition for Session-Id only applies when TLS 1.2 is
   used.  A different derivation is defined for TLS 1.3 in [TLS-EAP-
   TYPES].

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification defines EAP Session-Ids for ERP with EAP-SIM and
   EAP-AKA.  It therefore enables ERP key hierarchy establishment using
   fast re-authentication with EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA.

   There are no known security issues from using the NONCE_S and MAC as
   defined above.

   This specification also defines the EAP Session-Id for PEAP.  That

   derivation has no known security issues.

   These updates do not modify the Security Considerations outlined in
   RFC5247.

5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no actions for IANA.  RFC EDITOR: This section may be
   removed before publication.
