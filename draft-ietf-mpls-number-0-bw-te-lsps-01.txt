1.  Introduction

   A set of Link-type sub-TLVs have been defined for OSPF and ISIS (see
   [I-D.ietf-isis-te-bis] and [RFC3630]) in the context of MPLS Traffic
   Engineering in order to advertise various link characteristics such
   as the available bandwidth, traffic enginering metric, administrative
   group and so on.  There are various circumstances where it would be
   useful to also advertise the number of unconstrained Traffic
   Engineering Label Switch Path(s) (TE LSP).

   It is not uncommon to deploy MPLS Traffic Engineering for the sake of
   fast recovery relying on a local protection recovery mechanism such
   as MPLS TE Fast Reroute (see [RFC4090]).  In this case, a deployment
   model consists of deploying a full mesh of unconstrained TE LSPs
   between a set of LSRs and protect these TE LSPs with pre-established
   backup tunnels against link, SRLG and/or node failures.  The traffic
   routed onto such unconstrained TE LSP simply follows the IGP shortest
   path but is protected with MPLS TE Fast Reroute.

   With MPLS Traffic Engineering a usual rerouting criteria is the
   discovery of a better path for a TE LSP where a better path is
   defined as a path with a lower cost according to a specific metric;
   other metric such that the percentage of reserved bandwidth or the
   number of hops can also be used.  Unfortunately, for instance in the
   presence of ECMPs (Equal Cost Multi-Paths) in symetrical networks
   when unconstrained TE LSP are used, such metrics are usually
   inneffective and may lead to poorly load balanced traffic.  If the
   number of unconstrained TE LSPs traversing each link in the network
   is known, various algorithms can be designed so as to efficiently
   load balance the traffic carried by such unconstrained TE LSPs.  As
   currently defined in [RFC3630] and [I-D.ietf-isis-te-bis] the
   information related to the number of unconstrained TE LSP(s) is not
   available.  This document specifies a new Link-type Traffic
   Engineering sub-TLV used to indicate the number of unconstrained TE
   LSP signalled across a link.

   Note that the specification of load balancing algorithms is outside
   of the scope of this document and merely listed for the sake of
   illustration of the motivation for gathering such information.

   Furthermore, the knowledge of the number of unconstrained TE LSPs
   signalled across each link can be used for other purposes (e.g.
   management, ...).

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-mpls-number-0-bw-te-lsps-01         May 2006


   LSA: Link State Advertisement.

   LSP: Link State Packet.

   LSR: Label Switching Router.

   TE LSP: Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path.

   Unconstrained TE LSP: A TE LSP signalled with a bandwidth metric
   equal to 0.


3.  Protocol extensions

   A new Sub-TLV named NB-O-BW-LSP is defined that specifies the number
   of unconstrained TE LSPs signalled across a link.

3.1.  IS-IS

   The NB-0-BW-LSP TLV is OPTIONAL and MUST appear at most once within
   the extended IS reachability TLV (type 22) specified in [I-D.ietf-
   isis-te-bis].

   The IS-IS NB-0-BW-LSP TLV format is defined below:

   Type (1 octet): To be assigned by IANA (suggested value = 19)

   Length (1 octet): 4

   Value (4 octets): number of unconstrained TE LSP(s) signalled across
   the link.

3.2.  OSPF

   The NB-0-BW-LSP is OPTIONAL and MUST appear at most once within the
   Link TLV (Type 2) that is itself carried within the Traffic
   Engineering LSA specified in [RFC3630].

   The OSPF NB-0-BW-LSP TLV format is defined below:

   Type (2 octets): To be assigned by IANA (suggested value = 19)

   Length (2 octets): 4

   Value (4 octets): number of unconstrained TE LSP(s) signalled across
   the link.

4.  Elements of procedure

   An implementation may decide to implement a dual-thresholds mechanism
   to govern the origination of updated OSPF LSA () or ISIS LSP ().
   Similalry to other MPLS Traffic Engineering link characteristics,
   LSA/LSP origination trigger mechanisms are outside of the scope of
   this document.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will assign a new code point for the newly defined IS-IS sub-TLV
   (NB-0-BW-LSP) carried within the TLV 22 (suggested value =19)

   IANA will assign a new code point for the newly defined OSPF sub-TLV
   (NB-0-BW-LSP) carried within the Link TLV (Type 2) of the Traffic
   Engineering LSA (suggested value=19).


6.  Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues for IS-IS and OSPF.
