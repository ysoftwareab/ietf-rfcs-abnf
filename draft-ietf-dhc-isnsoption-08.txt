     DHCP Option Number for iSNS Revision 8                       July 2003

     Abstract

        This document describes the DHCP option to allow Internet Storage
        Name Service (iSNS) clients to automatically discover the location
        of the iSNS server through the use of DHCP for IPv4. iSNS provides
        discovery and management capabilities for Internet SCSI (iSCSI) and
        Internet Fibre Channel Protocol (iFCP) storage devices in an
        enterprise-scale IP storage network.  iSNS provides intelligent
        storage management services comparable to those found in Fibre
        Channel networks, allowing a commodity IP network to function in a
        similar capacity as a storage area network.

     Conventions used in this document

        iSNS refers to the Internet Storage Name Service framework
        consisting of the storage network model and associated services.

        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
        this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

        All frame formats are in big endian network byte order.  RESERVED
        fields SHOULD be set to zero.

        This document uses the following terms:

        "iSNS Client" - iSNS clients are processes resident in iSCSI and
        iFCP devices that initiate transactions with the iSNS server using
        the iSNS Protocol.

        "iSNS Server" - The iSNS server responds to iSNS protocol query and
        registration messages, and initiates asynchronous notification
        messages.  The iSNS server stores information registered by iSNS
        clients.

        "iSCSI (Internet SCSI)" - iSCSI is an encapsulation of SCSI for a
        new generation of storage devices interconnected with TCP/IP.

        "iFCP (Internet Fibre Channel Protocol)" - iFCP is a gateway-to-
        gateway protocol designed to interconnect existing Fibre Channel
        devices using TCP/IP.  iFCP maps the Fibre Channel transport and
        fabric services to TCP/IP.

     1.       Introduction

        The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 provides a
        framework for passing configuration information to hosts.  Its
        usefulness extends to hosts and devices using the iSCSI and iFCP
        protocols to connect to block level storage assets over a TCP/IP
        network.

        The iSNS Protocol provides a framework for automated discovery,
        management, and configuration of iSCSI and iFCP devices on a TCP/IP
        network.  It provides functionality similar to that found on Fibre

        Channel networks, except that iSNS works within the context of an IP
        network.  iSNS thereby provides the requisite storage intelligence
        to IP networks that are standard on existing Fibre Channel networks.

        Existing DHCP options cannot be used to find iSNS servers for the
        following reasons:

         a) iSNS functionality is distinctly different from other protocols
            using DHCP options.  Specifically, iSNS provides a significant
            superset of capabilities compared to typical name resolution
            protocols such as DNS.  It is designed to support client devices
            that allow themselves to be configured and managed from a
            central iSNS server

         b) iSNS requires a DHCP option format that provides more than the
            location of the iSNS server.  The DHCP option needs to specify
            the subset of iSNS services that may be actively used by the
            iSNS client.

        The DHCP option number for iSNS is used by iSCSI and iFCP devices to
        discover the location and role of the iSNS server.  The DHCP option
        number assigned for iSNS by IANA is <<TBD>>.

     2.       iSNS Option for DHCP

        This option specifies the location of the primary and backup iSNS
        servers and the iSNS services available to an iSNS client.

        iSNS Functions: A bitmapped field defining the functions supported
                by the iSNS servers.  The format of this field is described
                in section 2.1.

        Discovery Domain Access: A bit field indicating the types of iSNS
                clients that are allowed to modify Discovery Domains. The
                field contents are described in section 2.2.

        Administrative Flags field: Contains the administrative settings for
                the iSNS servers discovered through the DHCP query.  The
                contents of this field are described in section 2.3.

        iSNS Server Security Bitmap: Contains the iSNS server security
                settings specified in section 2.4.

        a1...a4: Depending on the setting of the Heartbeat bit in the
                Administrative Flags field (see section 2.3), this field
                contains either the IP address from which the iSNS heartbeat
                originates (see [ISNS]) or the IP address of the primary
                iSNS server.

        b1...b4: Depending on the setting of Heartbeat bit in the
                Administrative Flags field (see section 2.3), this field
                contains either the IP address of the primary iSNS server or
                a secondary iSNS server.

        Additional Secondary iSNS Servers: Each set of four octets specifies
                the IP address of a secondary iSNS server.

        The Code field through IP address field a1...a4 MUST be present in
        every response to the iSNS query, hence the Length field has a
        minimum value of 14.

        If the Heartbeat bit is set in the Administrative Flags field (see
        section 2.3), then b1...b4 MUST also be present. In this case, the
        minimum value of the Length field is 18.

        The inclusion of Additional Secondary iSNS Servers in the response
        MUST be indicated by increasing the Length field accordingly.

     2.1      iSNS Functions Field

        The iSNS Functions Field defines the iSNS server's operational role
        (i.e., how the iSNS server is to be used).  The iSNS server's role
        can be as basic as providing simple discovery information, or as
        significant as providing IKE/IPSec security policies and
        certificates for the use of iSCSI and iFCP devices. The format of
        the iSNS Functions field is shown in Figure 2:

                                 one, then the contents of all other iSNS
                                 Function fields are valid.  If set to zero,

                                 Function fields MUST be ignored.

                DD-based        Indicates whether or not devices in a
                Authorization:  common Discovery Domain (DD) are implicitly
                                 authorized to access one another. Although
                                 Discovery Domains control the scope of
                                 device discovery, they do not necessarily
                                 indicate whether or not a domain member is
                                 authorized to access discovered devices.
                                 If this bit is set to one, then devices in
                                 a common Discovery Domain are automatically
                                 allowed access to each other (if
                                 successfully authenticated).  If this bit
                                 is set to zero, then access authorization
                                 is not implied by domain membership and
                                 must be explicitly performed by each
                                 device. In either case, devices not in a
                                 common discovery domain are not allowed to
                                 access each other.

                Security Policy Indicates whether the iSNS client is to
                Distribution:   download and use the security policy
                                 configuration stored in the iSNS server.
                                 If set to one, then the policy is stored in
                                 the iSNS server and must be used by the
                                 iSNS client for its own security policy.
                                 If set to zero, then the iSNS client must
                                 obtain its security policy configuration by
                                 other means.

        Administrative Flags Field definitions:

                Enabled:           Specifies the validity of the remainder
                                   of the Administrative Flags field.  If
                                   set to one, then the contents of the
                                   remaining Administrative Flags are
                                   valid.  If set to zero, then the
                                   remaining contents MUST be ignored,
                                   indicating that iSNS administrative
                                   settings are obtained through means
                                   other than DHCP.

                Heartbeat:         Indicates whether the first IP address
                                   is the multicast address to which the
                                   iSNS heartbeat message is sent.  If set
                                   to one, then a1-a4 contains the
                                   heartbeat multicast address and b1-b4
                                   contains the IP address of the primary
                                   iSNS server, followed by the IP
                                   address(es) of any backup servers (see
                                   Figure 1).  If set to zero, then a1-a4
                                   contains the IP address of the primary
                                   iSNS server, followed by the IP
                                   address(es) of any backup servers.

                Management SCNs:   Indicates whether control nodes are
                                   authorized to register to receive
                                   Management State Change Notifications
                                   (SCN's).  Management SCN's are a special
                                   class of State Change Notification whose
                                   scope is the entire iSNS database.  If
                                   set to one, then control nodes are
                                   authorized to register to receive
                                   Management SCN's.  If set to zero, then

                                   control nodes are not authorized to
                                   receive Management SCN's (although they
                                   may receive normal SCN's).

                Default Discovery  Indicates whether a newly registered
                Domain:            device that is not explicitly placed
                                   into a Discovery Domain (DD) and
                                   Discovery Domain Set (DDS) should be
                                   automatically placed into a default DD
                                   and DDS.  If set to one, then a default
                                   DD shall contain all devices in the iSNS
                                   database that have not been explicitly
                                   placed into a DD by an iSNS client.  If
                                   set to zero, then devices not explicitly
                                   placed into a DD are not members of any
                                   DD.



     2.4      iSNS Server Security Bitmap

        The format of the iSNS server security Bitmap field is shown in
        Figure 5. If valid, this field communicates to the DHCP client the
        security settings that are required to communicate with the
        indicated iSNS server.

     3.       Security Considerations

        [RFC3118] should be consulted to determine the requirements for
        additional security measures to authenticate the iSNS option message
        received by the DHCP client.  If necessary, the authentication
        option described in [RFC3118] should be utilized.

        With regard to security considerations specific to the use of this
        DHCP option for iSNS server discovery, exposure to a "man-in-the-
        middle" attack by a hostile entity modifying or replacing the
        original iSNS option message should be considered a potential
        security exposure.  If the authentication option in [RFC3118] is not
        implemented, then an attacker may trick the iSNS client into
        connecting into rogue iSNS servers.

        If the authentication option for DHCP is not implemented and it is
        determined that the potential exists for a "man-in-the-middle"
        attack, then the DHCP option message for iSNS should not be
        utilized.

        iSNS security considerations are discussed in [iSNS] and [SEC-IPS].

     4.       IANA Considerations

        IANA has assigned an option code of TBD for the iSNS option.
