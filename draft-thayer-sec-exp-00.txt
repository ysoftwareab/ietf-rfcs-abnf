          Abstract

          Under certain conditions it is necessary to configure hosts
          running IP Security [RFC-1825] with security parameters and other
          information in an out-of-band manner.  This draft defines a file
          format that may be used to exchange such information via
          removable media or distribution via a web server.

          Internet Draft   IPSEC Import/Export Format       April 1997



          1. Introduction

          There is a need to configure hosts running IP Security through an
          out-of-band mechanism.  This is needed when manually keyed
          Security Associations are used, when Pre-defined Shared Secrets
          are used for ISAKMP Key Management [ISAKMP-OAKLEY], and where
          general security policy information must be distributed from a
          central site such as a site-wide IPSEC-aware Firewall.

          1.1 Terms

          Line - a single sequence of text terminated by some line
          terminator.  A line may be greater than 80 characters in length.

          Block - a collection of lines that describes one set of
          parameters.

          White Space - space between tokens.  White space must be SPACE or
          TAB characters.

          2. General Formatting

          The format of this file is designed to provide these features:

               - secure storage with a flexible set of cryptographic
                 mechanisms
               - able to be migrated forward to ISO 10646 (multi-byte) text

          The file contains this:

               revision number -- a 32-bit unsigned integer, in network
          order,
               the current value is 0x01000000
               option bitmask -- a 32-bit unsigned integer, in network
          order
               salt -- 16 bytes of data
               fingerprint -- 16 bytes of data containing the character
          string
               "--SECURITY FILE-".

          The option bits are:
            0x00000001 - RC4-40 encryption
            0x00000002 - RC4-128 encryption



          Thayer,Doraswamy                                    [Page 4]




          Internet Draft   IPSEC Import/Export Format       April 1997



            0x00000004 - DES encryption
            0x00000008 - 3DES encryption
            0x80000000 - text is US-ASCII
            0x40000000 - text is ISO 10646(?)

          (Note the IETF-compliant default is DES [DES].)

          The encrypted data contains text, currently in US-ASCII but can
          be ISO 10646 in the future.

          2.1 Configuration Line Formatting Rules

          The text consists of lines of arbitrary length.  Lines are
          terminated by one
          of these line terminators:

               - Hex 0x00 (Null)
               - Hex 0x0d (CR)
               - Hex 0x0a (LF)
               - Hex 0x0c (FF)

          There may be blank lines, these are ignored.

          There may be comment lines.  These start with the character '#'
          as the first character.

          The text consists of lines of 'commands' grouped into 'blocks'.
          Commands consist of combinations of keywords and values.  These
          are separated by 'white space', which may be any number of spaces
          or tabs.  There may be any number of blocks in a single file.

          2.2 Keywords

          The keywords listed here, in US English, shall be supported.  At
          a later time other alternative keyword text, possibly in a
          different language, may be substituted.

          Keywords are shown in UPPER CASE in this document for clarity.
          In the actual file the keywords are case-insensitive.

          If a command contains a keyword that is not recognized by an
          implementation, the command must be ignored.

          Internet Draft   IPSEC Import/Export Format       April 1997



          3. Block Contents

          Parameters are organized in one of four possible blocks,
          Configuration, Security Association, Policy, or Name.  Any number
          of these blocks may appear in a single file.  Each block is
          delimited by a BEGIN...END pair.

          3.1 Configuration Block

          The configuration block covers information not specific to a
          single Security Association or Policy Statement.  There may be
          only one config block per file.

          It contains a begin command, one or more parameter commands, and
          an end command.  This block is optional.  If there are no
          parameters it is not required.  A block with no parameter
          commands shall be silently ignored.

          Example:

               BEGIN CONFIGURATION <name>
               PARAMETER <param-name> <value>
               END

          There are one or more PARAMETER statements.  Parameters are
          represented in a name-value format, where <param-name> is the
          name of the parameter, and <value> is a value, expresed as a
          decimal number.

          3.2 Security Association Block

          The security association block is used to fully specify a
          security association for a host.  If you use manual keying you
          use this.  If you use a firewall to dictate the configuration to
          a client, you would also use this.  It must contain:

          . begin command
          . source address
          . destination address
          . transform
          . end command

          It also may contain:

          Internet Draft   IPSEC Import/Export Format       April 1997



          . source mask
          . destination mask
          . peer address
          . precedence
          . parameter

          Example:

               BEGIN SECURITY-ASSOCIATION <name>
               SOURCE IPv4 <address>
               SOURCE-MASK IPv4 <mask>
               DESTINATION IPv4 <address>
               DESTINATION-MASK IPv4 <mask>
               PEER IPv4 <address>
               TRANSFORM <doi-name>
               PRECEDENCE <value>
               PARAMETER <param-name> <param-value>
               END

          The source and destination address are required.  There may be
          masks specified for either source or destination or both.  A peer
          may be specified if appropriate.

          The <name> is any text name (must not include separators.)  The
          name must be unique within this file.  The name may be a maximum
          of 40 characters.

          The parameter name/value pairs are specific to the transform.
          These keywords are defined, others are allowed:

               KEY-VALUE
               IV-SIZE
               WINDOW-SIZE
               SPI

          Values are always in hexadecimal.  No leading '0x' is needed.
          Each PARAMETER command specifies a single value unless otherwise
          specified in this document.

          For example, the following specifies a key-value of
          12345678abcdef00cafedead:

               PARAMETER KEY-VALUE 12345678abcdef00cafedead



          Thayer,Doraswamy                                    [Page 7]




          Internet Draft   IPSEC Import/Export Format       April 1997




          The PRECEDENCE value indicates the order in which the wrappers
          should be applied, with precendence 1 (the lowest) meaning the
          innermost wrapper nearest the payload.

          3.3 Policy Block

          The policy block is similar to the security association block,
          except 'policy' is advisory in nature and does not specify
          precise parameters.  It is used for situations where key
          management or other general rules apply to the use of IP
          Security.  There may be several policy blocks specifying
          alternative choices for a given source/destination/precedence
          combination.

          A policy block must contain:
          . begin command
          . transform
          . end command

          It may also contain:
          . source addres
          . destination address
          . precedence
          . parameter
          . peer address
          . destination mask
          . source mask

          3.4 Name Block
          The name block contains identity information and also identifies
          what policy or security association blocks within a single file
          that it is associated with.

          It contains a name parameter, used to identify the user, and one
          or more name-info parameters which are used to store certificate
          or equivalent information.

          Example:
               begin name thing1-identity
               parameter name system-operator
               parameter name-info 3082175614568ad34
               end

          Internet Draft   IPSEC Import/Export Format       April 1997



          4. Applications

          4.1 Use of Policy Blocks with Key Management

          If a proposal is being built up then there will be one or more
          policy blocks each of which contains the same source,
          destination, and precedence but different transforms and
          parameters.

          If there are two or more alternative transforms for a given
          protocol, they must each have unique priorities.  In other words,
          if two policy blocks have:
          . same name
          . same source/mask
          . same destination/mask
          . same precedence

          then if they have different transforms of the same protocol (like
          two different kinds of ESP) then they must have different
          priorities and they must both have priorities.

          4.2 Configuration of ISAKMP Key Management

          ISAKMP security associations are configured using a variant of
          the policy block, which can include a KEY-VALUE parameter for
          pre-shared secrets.  See the additional non-DOI names in the
          TRANSFORM description also.

          For the ISAKMP/Oakley Security Association negotiation, you would
          have a Transform of Oakley, an encryption algorithm parameter, a
          hash algorithm parameter, an authentication parameter, and a pre-
          shared secret.  Since there are multiple possibilities for
          encryption algorithm, hash algorithm, and authentication scheme,
          there would be multiple policy blocks.

          Example:
               begin policy ed-kms-sample-1
               # example ISAKMP/Oakley S-A Proposal (one of a set)
               transform key-oakley
               parameter kms-encryption key-encrypt-des
               parameter kms-hash key-hash-md5
               parameter kms-authentication key-auth-pre-shared
               parameter key-value 313233343536373839



          Thayer,Doraswamy                                    [Page 9]




          Internet Draft   IPSEC Import/Export Format       April 1997



               parameter pfs 1
               end

          4.3 Policy Database Applications

          If policy blocks are being used with a database application it
          may be necessary to specify addressing information separately
          from configuration information.  In this case the names of the
          blocks are used to identify combinations of blocks that apply to
          specific node pairs.

          For example, if a given pair of nodes 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2 are
          to use either:

          . ESP DES with HMAC MD5 and replay OR
          . 1828 AH MD5 and 1829 DES ESP

          then the following set of blocks would be used:

               begin policy proposal1
               source ipv4 10.0.0.1
               destination ipv4 10.0.0.2
               end
               begin policy proposal1
               # information for ESP DES with HMAC MD5 here
               end
               begin policy proposal2
               source ipv4 10.0.0.1
               destination ipv4 10.0.0.2
               end
               begin policy proposal2
               # information for 1828 AH
               end
               begin policy proposal2
               # information for 1829 ESP
               end

          This can be parsed by detecting that the 'policy1' set occurs
          before the 'policy2' set and therefore is higher priority, and
          associating all the 'policy1' blocks together and all the
          'policy2' blocks together.

          5. Command Reference
          Each line of a block contains one command.  This section contains
          reference information for each command.  See the descriptions of
          the individual blocks for an explanation of which commands apply
          to which blocks.

          BEGIN

          The BEGIN command marks the beginning of a block.  There are
          three possible formats:

               BEGIN CONFIGURATION <name>
               BEGIN SECURITY-ASSOCIATION <name>
               BEGIN POLICY <name>

          The name is case sensitive.  This is the only value that is case
          sensitive.

          DESTINATION

          The DESTINATION command contains an Ipv4 or Ipv6 destination
          address.  The format is:

               DESTINATION <addr-type> <addr-value>

          where addr-type is ipv4 or ipv6.

          DESTINATION-MASK

          The DESTINATION-MASK command contains an Ipv4 or Ipv6 network
          mask.  The format is:

               DESTINATION-MASK <addr-type> <addr-mask-value>

          where addr-type is ipv4 or ipv6 and addr-mask-value is a mask, in
          n.n.n.n (i.e. 255.255.255.0 like CIDR [CIDR]) format for ipv4 and
          <appropriate stuff for ipv6>.

          PARAMETER

          The PARAMETER command contains a configuration value.  The format
          is:

               PARAMETER <param-name> <value>

          Private parameters are allowed, as well as the following general
          parameters:

          allow-local-modification

          ALLOW-LOCAL-MODIFICATION <1 or 0>

          means this file may be edited locally if 1, default is 1

          authentication-lifetime

          AUTHENTICATION-LIFETIME <value1> <value2> <sec or kb>

          Lifetime of authentication key.  First argument is soft limit (in
          hex, remember), second argument is hard limit, and third argument
          is 'SEC' if units are seconds, or 'KB' if units are kilobytes.

          encryption-lifetime

          ENCRYPTION-LIFETIME <value1> <value2> <sec or kb>

          Lifetime of encryption key.  First argument is soft limit (in
          hex, remember), second argument is hard limit, and third argument
          is 'SEC' if units are seconds, or 'KB' if units are kilobytes.

          export

          export <1 or 0>

          means this file is intended to be safe for export use relative to
          the country in which the file was generated.  Note it would be a
          good idea to use comments near this parameter.

          generated-by

          GENERATED-BY <component>

          specifies vendor/component that generated the file.  OPTIONALLY
          this may be an SNMP object identifier to mark the software that
          generated the file, e.g. enterprise.252.2.1

          group

          GROUP <1>

          specifies Oakley Default Group.  Must be a 1.

          Internet Draft   IPSEC Import/Export Format       April 1997



          Hashing scheme for ISAKMP/OAKLEY.  Possible values are key-hash-
          md5 or key-hash-sha or key-hash-tiger.

          merge

          MERGE <1 or 0>

          If 1, means this file may be merged into existing local security
          information store if that is relevant.  If 0, means overwrite the
          default value if no merge parameter is specified shall be 1
          (allow merge)

          pfs

          PFS <1 or 0>

          If 1, ISAKMP/OAKLEY will use Perfect Forward Secrecy.

          sa-lifetime

          SA-LIFETIME <value1> <value2> <sec or kb>

          Lifetime of security association.  First argument is soft value
          (in hex, remember), second argument is hard value, and third
          argument is 'SEC' if units are seconds, or 'KB' if units are
          kilobytes.

          skey-value

          skey-value <stuff>

          used when key is stored using S/Key.

          spi

          spi <value in hex>

          this is the SPI number for security association blocks.

          window-size

          WINDOW-SIZE <value>




          Thayer,Doraswamy                                   [Page 14]




          Internet Draft   IPSEC Import/Export Format       April 1997



          This is the window size for transforms that use replay options.

          PEER

          The PEER command specifies the other end of an Ipv4 or Ipv6
          tunnel. The format is:

               PEER <addr-type> <addr-value>

          where addr-type is ipv4 or ipv6.


          PRECEDENCE

          The PRECEDENCE command specifies the order in which security
          protocol headers are placed in an IP packet.  For example, a
          regular Ipv4 packet looks like this:

               IP Header -- Payload

          Then, adding one AH header, you have

               IP Header -- AH Header -- Payload

          If there are multiple headers, the order must be specified to
          avoid confusion.  The 'precedence' does this.  The INNER-MOST
          security header, the one nearest the payload, is numbered ONE.
          For example, a packet with AH and two ESP headers, like this:

               IP -- AH[x] -- ESP[y] -- ESP[z] -- Payload

          has precedence 1 for ESP[z], precedence 2 for ESP[y], and
          precedence 3 for AH[x].

          SOURCE

          The SOURCE command contains an Ipv4 or Ipv6 source address. The
          format is:

               SOURCE <addr-type> <addr-value>

          where addr-type is ipv4 or ipv6.

          Internet Draft   IPSEC Import/Export Format       April 1997



          SOURCE-MASK

          The SOURCE-MASK command contains an Ipv4 or Ipv6 network mask.
          The format is:

               SOURCE-MASK <addr-type> <addr-mask-value>

          where addr-type is ipv4 or ipv6 and addr-mask-value is a mask, in
          n.n.n.n (i.e. 255.255.255.0 like CIDR [CIDR]) format for ipv4 and
          <appropriate stuff for ipv6>.

          TRANSFORM

          The TRANSFORM command specifies what cryptographic transform is
          to be used. The <doi-name> field of the TRANSFORM entry is a name
          from [DOI], currently these include:

               AH-1828
               AH-HMAC-MD5-REPLAY
               AH-HMAC-SHA-REPLAY
               ESP-1829-TRANSPORT
               ESP-1829-TUNNEL
               ESP-DES-CBC-HMAC-REPLAY
               (DENY-ALL)
               (ALLOW-CLEAR)
               KEY-OAKLEY

          6. Security Considerations

          This file format is used to store security information (e.g.
          keys) used for IP Security between hosts.  It therefore must be
          protected appropriately.  For this reason the file is always
          stored in an encrypted manner using one of the defined encryption
          schemes.
