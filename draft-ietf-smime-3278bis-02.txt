1. Introduction 

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) is cryptographic algorithm 
   independent.  This specification defines a profile for the use of 
   Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) public key algorithms in the CMS.  
   The ECC algorithms are incorporated into the following CMS content 
   types: 

     -  'SignedData' to support ECC-based digital signature methods 
        (ECDSA) to sign content 

     -  'EnvelopedData' to support ECC-based public-key agreement 
        methods (ECDH and ECMQV) to generate pairwise key-encryption 
        keys to encrypt content-encryption keys used for content 
        encryption 

     -  'AuthenticatedData' to support ECC-based public-key agreement 
        methods (ECMQV) to generate pairwise key-encryption keys to 
        encrypt MAC keys used for content authentication and integrity. 

     -  'AuthEnvelopedData' to support ECC-based public-key agreement 
        methods (ECMQV) to generate pairwise key-encryption keys to 
        encrypt MAC keys used for authenticated encryption modes. 

   Certification of EC public keys is also described to provide public-
   key distribution in support of the specified techniques. 

1.1. Requirements Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [MUST]. 

1.2. Changes since RFC 3278 

   The following summarizes the changes: 

     - Abstract: The basis of the document was change to refer to NIST 
       FIPP 186-3 and SP800-56A.

     - Section 4.2: This section was added to address AuthEnvelopedData 
       with ECMQV. 

     - Section 5: This section was moved to Section 8. The 1st paragraph 
       was modified as the requirements are difficult to test. The 
       requirements were updated for hash algorithms and 
       recommendations for matching curves and hash algorithms. Also 
       expanded to indicate which ECDH and ECMQV variants, key wrap 
       algorithms, and content encryption algorithms are required for

       parameters (AES wraps have absent parameters). 

     - Section 9: Replaced text, which was a summary paragraph, with an 
       updated security considerations section. Paragraph referring to 
       definitions of SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 is 
       deleted. 

     - Added ASN.1 modules. 

     - Updated acknowledgements section. 

2. SignedData using ECC 

   This section describes how to use ECC algorithms with the CMS 
   SignedData format to sign data. 

2.1. SignedData using ECDSA 

   This section describes how to use the Elliptic Curve Digital 
   Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with SignedData.  ECDSA is specified in 
   [FIPS186-3].  The method is the elliptic curve analog of the Digital 
   Signature Algorithm (DSA) [FIPS186-3]. ECDSA is used with the Secure 
   Hash Algorithm (SHA) [FIPS180-3]. 

   In an implementation that uses ECDSA with CMS SignedData, the 
   following techniques and formats MUST be used. 

2.1.1. Fields of the SignedData 

   When using ECDSA with SignedData, the fields of SignerInfo are as in 
   [CMS], but with the following restrictions: 

     - digestAlgorithm MUST contain the algorithm identifier of the hash 
       algorithm (see Section 7.1) which MUST be one of the following: 
       id-sha1, id-sha224, id-sha256 identifies, id-sha384, and id-
       sha512. 

     - signatureAlgorithm contains the signature algorithm identifier 
       (see Section 7.1): ecdsa-with-SHA1, ecdsa-with-SHA224, ecdsa-
       with-SHA256, ecdsa-with-SHA384, or ecdsa-with-SHA512.

Internet-Draft               RFC 3278bis                      June 2008 
    

     - signature MUST contain the DER encoding (as an octet string) of a 
       value of the ASN.1 type ECDSA-Sig-Value (see Section 7.2).  

   When using ECDSA, the SignedData certificates field MAY include the 
   certificate(s) for the EC public key(s) used in the generation of the 
   ECDSA signatures in SignedData.  ECC certificates are discussed in 
   Section 5. 

2.1.2. Actions of the sending agent 

   When using ECDSA with SignedData, the sending agent uses the message 
   digest calculation process and signature generation process for 
   SignedData that are specified in [CMS].  To sign data, the sending 
   agent uses the signature method specified in [FIPS186-3]. 

   The sending agent encodes the resulting signature using the  
   ECDSA-Sig-Value syntax (see Section 7.2) and places it in the 
   SignerInfo.signature field. 

2.1.3. Actions of the receiving agent 

   When using ECDSA with SignedData, the receiving agent uses the 
   message digest calculation process and signature verification process 
   for SignedData that are specified in [CMS].  To verify SignedData, 
   the receiving agent uses the signature verification method specified 
   in [FIPS186-3]. 

   In order to verify the signature, the receiving agent retrieves the 
   integers r and s from the SignerInfo signature field of the received 
   message. 

3. EnvelopedData using ECC Algorithms 

   This section describes how to use ECC algorithms with the CMS 
   EnvelopedData format. 

3.1. EnvelopedData using (ephemeral-static) ECDH 

   This section describes how to use the ephemeral-static Elliptic Curve 
   Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement algorithm with EnvelopedData, 
   method C(1, 1, ECC CDH) from [SP800-56A].  Ephemeral-static ECDH is 
   the elliptic curve analog of the ephemeral-static Diffie-Hellman key 
   agreement algorithm specified jointly in the documents [CMS-ALG] and 
   [CMS-DH]. 

   In an implementation uses ECDH with CMS EnvelopedData, the following 
   techniques and formats MUST be used.

Internet-Draft               RFC 3278bis                      June 2008 
    

   The fields of EnvelopedData are as in [CMS], as ECDH is a key 
   agreement algorithm the RecipientInfo kari choice is used.  When 
   using ECDH, the EnvelopedData originatorInfo field MAY include the 
   certificate(s) for the EC public key(s) used in the formation of the 
   pairwise key.  ECC certificates are discussed in Section 5. 

3.1.1. Fields of KeyAgreeRecipientInfo 

   When using ephemeral-static ECDH with EnvelopedData, the fields of 
   KeyAgreeRecipientInfo are as follows: 

     - version MUST be 3. 

     - originator MUST be the alternative originatorKey.  The 
       originatorKey algorithm field MUST contain the id-ecPublicKey 
       object identifier (see Section 7.1). The parameters associated 
       with id-ecPublicKey MUST be absent or ECPoint.  NOTE: The 
       previous version of this document required NULL be present, 
       support for this is OPTIONAL.  The originatorKey publicKey field 
       MUST contain the value of the ASN.1 type ECPoint (see Section 
       7.2), which represents the sending agent's ephemeral EC public 
       key.  The ECPoint in uncompressed form MUST be supported. 

     - ukm MAY be present or absent. However, message originators SHOULD 
       include the ukm. As specified in RFC 3852 [CMS], implementations 
       MUST support ukm message recipient processing, so 
       interoperability is not a concern if the ukm is present or 
       absent.  When present, the ukm is used to ensure that a 
       different key-encryption key is generated, even when the 
       ephemeral private key is improperly used more than once, by 
       using the ECC-Shared-Info as input to in the key derivation 
       function (see Section 7.2). 

     - keyEncryptionAlgorithm MUST contain the key encryption algorithm 
       object identifier (see Section 7.1).  The parameters field 
       contains KeyWrapAlgorithm.  The KeyWrapAlgorithm is the 
       algorithm identifier that indicates the symmetric encryption 
       algorithm used to encrypt the content-encryption key (CEK) with 
       the key-encryption key (KEK) and any associated parameters.  
       Algorithm requirements are found in Section 8. 

     - recipientEncryptedKeys contains an identifier and an encrypted 
       key for each recipient.  The RecipientEncryptedKey 
       KeyAgreeRecipientIdentifier MUST contain either the 
       issuerAndSerialNumber identifying the recipient's certificate or 
       the RecipientKeyIdentifier containing the subject key identifier 
       from the recipient's certificate.  In both cases, the

Internet-Draft               RFC 3278bis                      June 2008 
    

       recipient's certificate contains the recipient's static ECDH 
       public key.  RecipientEncryptedKey EncryptedKey MUST contain the 
       content-encryption key encrypted with the ephemeral-static, 
       ECDH-generated pairwise key-encryption key using the algorithm 
       specified by the KeyWrapAlgorithm.  

3.1.2. Actions of the sending agent 

   When using ephemeral-static ECDH with EnvelopedData, the sending 
   agent first obtains the recipient's EC public key and domain 
   parameters (e.g. from the recipient's certificate).  The sending 
   agent then determines an integer "keydatalen", which is the 
   KeyWrapAlgorithm symmetric key-size in bits, and also a bit string 
   "SharedInfo", which is the DER encoding of ECC-CMS-SharedInfo (see 
   Section 7.2).  The sending agent then performs the key deployment and 
   the key agreement operation of the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman 
   Scheme specified in [SP800-56A].  As a result the sending agent 
   obtains: 

     - an ephemeral public key, which is represented as a value of the 
       type ECPoint (see Section 7.2), encapsulated in a bit string and 
       placed in the KeyAgreeRecipientInfo originator field, and 

     - a shared secret bit string "K", which is used as the pairwise 
       key-encryption key for that recipient, as specified in [CMS]. 

3.1.3. Actions of the receiving agent 

   When using ephemeral-static ECDH with EnvelopedData, the receiving 
   agent determines the bit string "SharedInfo", which is the DER 
   encoding of ECC-CMS-SharedInfo (see Section 7.2), and the integer 
   "keydatalen" from the key-size, in bits, of the KeyWrapAlgorithm. The 
   receiving agent retrieves the ephemeral EC public key from the bit 
   string KeyAgreeRecipientInfo originator, with a value of the type 
   ECPoint (see Section 7.2) encapsulated as a bit string, and if 
   present original supplied additional user key material from the ukm 
   field.  The receiving agent performs the key agreement operation of 
   the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Scheme specified in [SP800-56A].  
   As a result, the receiving agent obtains a shared secret bit string 
   "K", which is used as the pairwise key-encryption key to unwrap the 
   CEK. 

3.2. EnvelopedData using 1-Pass ECMQV 

   This section describes how to use the 1-Pass elliptic curve MQV 
   (ECMQV) key agreement algorithm with EnvelopedData, method 
   C(1, 2, ECC MQV) from [SP800-56A].  Like the KEA algorithm [CMS-KEA],

Internet-Draft               RFC 3278bis                      June 2008 
    

   1-Pass ECMQV uses three key pairs: an ephemeral key pair, a static 
   key pair of the sending agent, and a static key pair of the receiving 
   agent.  An advantage of using 1-Pass ECMQV is that it can be used 
   with both EnvelopedData and AuthenticatedData. 

   In an implementation uses 1-Pass ECMQV with CMS EnvelopedData, the 
   following techniques and formats MUST be used. 

   The fields of EnvelopedData are as in [CMS], as 1-Pass ECMQV is a key 
   agreement algorithm the RecipientInfo kari choice is used.  When 
   using 1-Pass ECMQV, the EnvelopedData originatorInfo field MAY 
   include the certificate(s) for the EC public key(s) used in the 
   formation of the pairwise key.  ECC certificates are discussed in 
   Section 5. 

3.2.1. Fields of KeyAgreeRecipientInfo 

   When using 1-Pass ECMQV with EnvelopedData, the fields of 
   KeyAgreeRecipientInfo are: 

     - version MUST be 3.  

     - originator identifies the static EC public key of the sender.  It 
       SHOULD be one of the alternatives, issuerAndSerialNumber or 
       subjectKeyIdentifier, and point to one of the sending agent's 
       certificates.  

     - ukm MUST be present.  The ukm field MUST contain an octet string 
       which is the DER encoding of the type MQVuserKeyingMaterial (see 
       Section 7.2).  The MQVuserKeyingMaterial ephemeralPublicKey 
       algorithm field MUST contain the id-ecPublicKey object 
       identifier (see Section 7.1). The parameters associated with id-
       ecPublicKey MUST be abent or ECPoint.  NOTE: The previous 
       version of this document required NULL be present, support is 
       OPTIONAL.  The MQVuserKeyingMaterial ephemeralPublicKey 
       publicKey field MUST contain the DER-encoding of the ASN.1 type 
       ECPoint (see Section 7.2) representing the sending agent's 
       ephemeral EC public key.  The MQVuserKeyingMaterial addedukm 
       field, if present, SHOULD contain an octet string of additional 
       user keying material of the sending agent.  

     - keyEncryptionAlgorithm MUST be the key encryption algorithm 
       identifier (see Section 7.1), with the parameters field 
       KeyWrapAlgorithm. The KeyWrapAlgorithm indicates the symmetric 
       encryption algorithm used to encrypt the CEK with the KEK 
       generated using the 1-Pass ECMQV algorithm and any associated 
       parameters. Algorithm requirements are found in Section 8.

     - recipientEncryptedKeys contains an identifier and an encrypted 
       key for each recipient. The RecipientEncryptedKey 
       KeyAgreeRecipientIdentifier MUST contain either the 
       issuerAndSerialNumber identifying the recipient's certificate or 
       the RecipientKeyIdentifier containing the subject key identifier 
       from the recipient's certificate. In both cases, the recipient's 
       certificate contains the recipient's static ECMQV public key. 
       RecipientEncryptedKey EncryptedKey MUST contain the content-
       encryption key encrypted with the 1-Pass ECMQV-generated 
       pairwise key-encryption key using the algorithm specified by the 
       KeyWrapAlgorithm.  

3.2.2. Actions of the sending agent 

   When using 1-Pass ECMQV with EnvelopedData, the sending agent first 
   obtains the recipient's EC public key and domain parameters (e.g. 
   from the recipient's certificate), and checks that the domain 
   parameters are the same, as the sender's domain parameters.  The 
   sending agent then determines an integer "keydatalen", which is the 
   KeyWrapAlgorithm symmetric key-size in bits, and also a bit string 
   "SharedInfo", which is the DER encoding of ECC-CMS-SharedInfo (see 
   Section 7.2).  The sending agent then performs the key deployment and 
   key agreement operations of the Elliptic Curve MQV Scheme specified 
   in [SP800-56A].  As a result, the sending agent obtains: 

     - an ephemeral public key, which is represented as a value of type 
       ECPoint (see Section 7.2), encapsulated in a bit string, placed 
       in an MQVuserKeyingMaterial ephemeralPublicKey publicKey field 
       (see Section 7.2), and 

     - a shared secret bit string "K", which is used as the pairwise 
       key-encryption key for that recipient, as specified in [CMS]. 

   The ephemeral public key can be re-used with an AuthenticatedData for 
   greater efficiency. 

3.2.3. Actions of the receiving agent 

   When using 1-Pass ECMQV with EnvelopedData, the receiving agent 
   determines the bit string "SharedInfo", which is the DER encoding of 
   ECC-CMS-SharedInfo (see Section 7.2), and the integer "keydatalen" 
   from the key-size, in bits, of the KeyWrapAlgorithm.  The receiving 
   agent then retrieves the static and ephemeral EC public keys of the 
   originator, from the originator and ukm fields as described in 
   Section 3.2.1, and its static EC public key identified in the rid 
   field and checks that the domain parameters are the same.  The 
   receiving agent then performs the key agreement operation of the

   Elliptic Curve MQV Scheme [SP800-56A].  As a result, the receiving 
   agent obtains a shared secret bit string "K" which is used as the 
   pairwise key-encryption key to unwrap the CEK. 

4. AuthenticatedData and AuthEnvelopedData using ECC 

   This section describes how to use ECC algorithms with the CMS 
   AuthenticatedData format.  AuthenticatedData lacks non-repudiation, 
   and so in some instances is preferable to SignedData.  (For example, 
   the sending agent might not want the message to be authenticated when 
   forwarded.) 

   This section also describes how to use ECC algorithms with the CMS 
   AuthEnvelopedData format [CMS-AUTHENV].  AuthEnvelopedData supports 
   authentication and encryption, and in some instances is preferable to 
   signing and then encrypting data. 

4.1. AuthenticatedData using 1-pass ECMQV 

   This section describes how to use the 1-Pass elliptic curve MQV 
   (ECMQV) key agreement algorithm with AuthenticatedData.  ECMQV is 
   method C(1, 2, ECC MQV) from [SP800-56A].  An advantage of using 1-
   Pass ECMQV is that it can be used with EnvelopedData, 
   AuthenticatedData, and AuthEnvelopedData. 

   When using ECMQV with AuthenticatedData, the fields of 
   AuthenticatedData are as in [CMS], but with the following 
   restrictions: 

     - macAlgorithm MUST contain the algorithm identifier of the message 
       authentication code algorithm (see Section 7.1) which MUST be 
       one of the following: id-hmacWithSHA1, id-hmacWITHSHA224, id-
       hmacWITHSHA256, id-hmacWITHSHA384, and id-hmacWITHSHA512.  

     - digestAlgorithm MUST contain the algorithm identifier of the hash 
       algorithm (see Section 7.1) which MUST be one of the following: 
       id-sha1, id-sha224, id-sha256, id-sha384, and id-sha512.  

   The fields of AuthenticatedData are as in [CMS], as 1-Pass ECMQV is a 
   key agreement algorithm the RecipientInfo kari choice is used.  When 
   using 1-Pass ECMQV, the AuthenticatedData originatorInfo field MAY 
   include the certificate(s) for the EC public key(s) used in the 
   formation of the pairwise key.  ECC certificates are discussed in 
   Section 5.

4.1.1. Fields of the KeyAgreeRecipientInfo 

   The AuthenticatedData KeyAgreeRecipientInfo fields are used in the 
   same manner as the fields for the corresponding EnvelopedData 
   KeyAgreeRecipientInfo fields of Section 3.2.1 of this document. 

4.1.2. Actions of the sending agent 

   The sending agent uses the same actions as for EnvelopedData with  
   1-Pass ECMQV, as specified in Section 3.2.2 of this document. 

   The ephemeral public key can be re-used with an EnvelopedData for 
   greater efficiency. 

   Note: if there are multiple recipients, an attack is possible where 
   one recipient modifies the content without other recipients noticing 
   [BON].  A sending agent who is concerned with such an attack SHOULD 
   use a separate AuthenticatedData for each recipient. 

4.1.3. Actions of the receiving agent 

   The receiving agent uses the same actions as for EnvelopedData with 
   1-Pass ECMQV, as specified in Section 3.2.3 of this document. 

   Note: see Note in Section 4.1.2. 

4.2. AuthEnvelopedData using 1-pass ECMQV 

   This section describes how to use the 1-Pass elliptic curve MQV 
   (ECMQV) key agreement algorithm with AuthEnvelopedData.  ECMQV is 
   method C(1, 2, ECC MQV) from [SP800-56A].  An advantage of using 1-
   Pass ECMQV is that it can be used with EnvelopedData, 
   AuthenticatedData, and AuthEnvelopedData. 

   The fields of AuthEnvelopedData are as in [CMS], as 1-Pass ECMQV is a 
   key agreement algorithm the RecipientInfo kari choice is used.  When 
   using 1-Pass ECMQV, the AuthEnvelopedData originatorInfo field MAY 
   include the certificate(s) for the EC public key(s) used in the 
   formation of the pairwise key.  ECC certificates are discussed in 
   Section 5. 

4.2.1. Fields of the KeyAgreeRecipientInfo 

   The AuthEnvelopedData KeyAgreeRecipientInfo fields are used in the 
   same manner as the fields for the corresponding EnvelopedData 
   KeyAgreeRecipientInfo fields of Section 3.2.1 of this document.

4.2.2. Actions of the sending agent 

   The sending agent uses the same actions as for EnvelopedData with 1-
   Pass ECMQV, as specified in Section 3.2.2 of this document. 

   The ephemeral public key can be re-used with an EnvelopedData for 
   greater efficiency. 

4.2.3. Actions of the receiving agent 

   The receiving agent uses the same actions as for EnvelopedData with 
   1-Pass ECMQV, as specified in Section 3.2.3 of this document. 

5. Certificates using ECC 

   Internet X.509 certificates [PKI] can be used in conjunction with 
   this specification to distribute agents' public keys.  The use of ECC 
   algorithms and keys within X.509 certificates is specified in 
   [PKI-ALG]. 

6. SMIMECapabilities Attribute and ECC 

   A sending agent MAY announce to receiving agents that it supports one 
   or more of the ECC algorithms in this document by using the 
   SMIMECapabilities signed attribute [MSG]. 

   The SMIMECapability value to indicate support for one of the ECDSA 
   signature algorithms is a SEQUENCE with the capabilityID field 
   containing the object identifier ecdsa-with-SHA* object identifiers 
   (where * is 1, 224, 256, 384, or 512) and with NULL parameters.  The 
   DER encodings are: 

      ecdsa-with-SHA1:   30 0b 06 07 2a 86 48 ce 3d 04 01 05 00

7. ASN.1 Syntax 

   The ASN.1 syntax used in this document is gathered in this section 
   for reference purposes. 

7.1. Algorithm Identifiers 

   This section provides the object identifiers for the algorithms used 
   in this document along with any associated parameters. 

7.1.1. Digest Algorithms 

   Digest algorithm object identifiers are used in the SignedData 
   digestAlgorithms and digestAlgorithm fields, the AuthenticatedData 
   digestAlgorithm field, and the AuthEnvelopedData digestAlgorithm 
   field.  The digest algorithms used in this document are: SHA-1, 
   SHA224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.  The object identifiers and 
   parameters associated with these algorithms are found in [SMIME-
   SHA2]. 

7.1.2. Originator Public Key 

   The KeyAgreeRecipientInfo originator filed use the following object 
   identifier to indicate an elliptic curve public key: 

      id-ecPublicKey OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
        ansi-x9-62 keyType(2) 1 } 

   where 

      ansi-x9-62 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
        iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) 10045 } 

   When the object identifier id-ecPublicKey is used here with an 
   algorithm identifier, the associated parameters MUST be either absent 
   or ECPoint. Implementations MUST accept id-ecPublicKey with the 
   parameters field with absent, NULL, and ECPoint parameters.  If 
   ECPoint is present its value is ignored.  Implementations SHOULD 
   generate absent parameters for the id-ecPublicKey object identifier 
   in the KeyAgreeRecipientInfo originator field. 

7.1.3. Signature Algorithms 

   Signature algorithm identifiers are used in the SignedData 
   signatureAlgorithm and signature field.  The signature algorithms 
   used in this document are ECDSA with SHA-1, ECDSA with SHA-224, ECDSA 
   with SHA-256, ECDSA with SHA-384, and ECDSA with SHA-512. The object

   identifiers and parameters associated with these algorithms are found 
   in [PKI-ALG]. 

7.1.4. Key Agreement Algorithms 

   Key agreement algorithms are used in EnvelopedData, 
   AuthenticatedData, and AuthEnvelopedData in the KeyAgreeRecipientInfo 
   keyEncryptionAlgorithm field.  The following object identifiers 
   indicate the key agreement algorithms used in this document [SP800-
   56A]:

   and 

      secg-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
        iso(1) identified-organization(3) certicom(132) schemes(1) } 

   When the object identifiers are used here within an algorithm 
   identifier, the associated parameters field contains KeyWrapAlgorithm 
   to indicate the key wrap algorithm and any associated parameters. 

7.1.5. Key Wrap Algorithms 

   Key wrap algorithms are used as part of the parameters in the key 
   agreement algorithm.  The key wrap algorithms used in this document 
   are Triple-DES, AES-128, AES-192, AES-256. The object identifier and 
   parameters for these algorithms are found in [CMS-ALG] and [CMS-AES]. 

7.1.6. Content Encryption Algorithms 

   Content encryption algorithms are used in EnvelopedData and 
   AuthEnvelopedData in the EncryptedContentInfo 
   contentEncryptionAlgorithm field.  The content encryption algorithms 
   used with EnvelopedData in this document are AES-128 in CBC mode, 
   AES-192 in CBC mode, and AES-256 in CBC mode.  The object identifiers 
   and parameters associated with these algorithms are found in [CMS-
   AES]. The content encryption algorithms used with AuthEnvelopedData 
   in this document are AES-128 in CCM mode, AES-192 in CCM mode, AES-
   256 in CCM mode, AES-128 in GCM mode, AES-192 in GCM mode, and AES-
   256 in GCM mode.  The object identifiers and parameters associated 
   with these algorithms are found in [CMS-AESCG].

7.1.7. Message Authentication Code Algorithms 

   Message authentication code algorithms are used in AuthenticatedData 
   and AuthEnvelopedData in the macAlgorithm field.  The message 
   authentication code algorithms used in this document are HMAC with 
   SHA-1, HMAC with SHA-224, HMAC with SHA-1, HMAC with SHA-1, and HMAC 
   with SHA-1.  The object identifiers and parameters associated with 
   these algorithms are found in [HMAC-SHA1] and [HMAC-SHA2]. 

7.2. Other Syntax 

   The following additional syntax is used here. 

   When using ECDSA with SignedData, ECDSA signatures are encoded using 
   the type: 

     ECDSA-Sig-Value ::= SEQUENCE { 
       r INTEGER, 
       s INTEGER } 

   ECDSA-Sig-Value is specified in [PKI-ALG].  Within CMS, ECDSA-Sig-
   Value is DER-encoded and placed within a signature field of 
   SignedData. 

   When using ECDH and ECMQV with EnvelopedData, AuthenticatedData, and 
   AuthEnvelopedData, ephemeral and static public keys are encoded using 
   the type ECPoint. Implementations MUST support uncompressed keys and 
   MAY support compressed keys. 

     ECPoint ::= OCTET STRING 

   When using ECMQV with EnvelopedData, AuthenticatedData, and 
   AuthEnvelopedData, the sending agent's ephemeral public key and 
   additional keying material are encoded using the type: 

     MQVuserKeyingMaterial ::= SEQUENCE { 
       ephemeralPublicKey      OriginatorPublicKey, 
       addedukm            [0] EXPLICIT UserKeyingMaterial OPTIONAL  } 

   The ECPoint syntax in used to represent the ephemeral public key and 
   placed in the ephemeralPublicKey field.  The additional user keying 
   material is placed in the addedukm field.  Then the 
   MQVuserKeyingMaterial value is DER-encoded and placed within a ukm 
   field of EnvelopedData, AuthenticatedData, or AuthEnvelopedData.

   When using ECDH or ECMQV with EnvelopedData, AuthenticatedData, or 
   AuthEnvelopedData, the key-encryption keys are derived by using the 
   type: 

     ECC-CMS-SharedInfo ::= SEQUENCE { 
       keyInfo         AlgorithmIdentifier, 
       entityUInfo [0] EXPLICIT OCTET STRING OPTIONAL, 
       suppPubInfo [2] EXPLICIT OCTET STRING  } 

   The fields of ECC-CMS-SharedInfo are as follows: 

      keyInfo contains the object identifier of the key-encryption 
      algorithm (used to wrap the CEK) and associated parameters. In 
      this specification, 3DES wrap has NULL parameters while the AES 
      wraps have absent parameters. 

      entityUInfo optionally contains additional keying material 
      supplied by the sending agent.  When used with ECDH and CMS, the 
      entityUInfo field contains the octet string ukm.  When used with 
      ECMQV and CMS, the entityUInfo contains the octet string addedukm 
      (encoded in MQVuserKeyingMaterial). 

      suppPubInfo contains the length of the generated KEK, in bits, 
      represented as a 32 bit number, as in [CMS-DH] and [CMS-AES].  
      (E.g. for AES-256 it would be 00 00 01 00.) 

   Within CMS, ECC-CMS-SharedInfo is DER-encoded and used as input to 
   the key derivation function, as specified in [SP800-56A]. 

   Note that ECC-CMS-SharedInfo differs from the OtherInfo specified in 
   [CMS-DH].  Here, a counter value is not included in the keyInfo field 
   because the key derivation function specified in [SP800-56A] ensures 
   that sufficient keying data is provided. 

8. Recommended Algorithms and Elliptic Curves 

   It is RECOMMEND that implementations of this specification support 
   SignedData. Support for EnvelopedData and AuthenticatedData is 
   OPTIONAL. 

   In order to encourage interoperability, implementations SHOULD use 
   the elliptic curve domain parameters specified by [PKI-ALG]. 

   Implementations that support SignedData with ECDSA: 

     - MUST support ECDSA with SHA-256.

9. Security Considerations 

   Cryptographic algorithms will be broken or weakened over time.  
   Implementers and users need to check that the cryptographic 
   algorithms listed in this document continue to provide the expected 
   level of security.  The IETF from time to time may issue documents 
   dealing with the current state of the art.

Internet-Draft               RFC 3278bis                      June 2008 
    

   Cryptographic algorithms rely on random number. See [RANDOM] for 
   guidance on generation of random numbers. 

   Receiving agents that validate signatures and sending agents that 
   encrypt messages, need to be cautious of cryptographic processing 
   usage when validating signatures and encrypting messages using keys 
   larger than those mandated in this specification.  An attacker could 
   send certificates with keys which would result in excessive 
   cryptographic processing, for example keys larger than those mandated 
   in this specification, which could swamp the processing element.  
   Agents which use such keys without first validating the certificate 
   to a trust anchor are advised to have some sort of cryptographic 
   resource management system to prevent such attacks. 

   Using secret keys of an appropriate size is crucial to the security 
   of a Diffie-Hellman exchange.  For elliptic curve groups, the size of 
   the secret key must be equal to the size of n (the order of the group 
   generated by the point g).  Using larger secret keys provides 
   absolutely no additional security, and using smaller secret keys is 
   likely to result in dramatically less security.  (See [SP800-56A] for 
   more information on selecting secret keys.) 

   This specification is based on [CMS], [CMS-AUTHENV], [CMS-ALG],  
   [CMS-AESCG], [X9.62], [SEC1], and [SEC2] and the appropriate security 
   considerations of those documents apply. 

   In addition, implementors of AuthenticatedData should be aware of the 
   concerns expressed in [BON] when using AuthenticatedData to send 
   messages to more than one recipient.  Also, users of MQV should be 
   aware of the vulnerability in [K]. 

   When implementing EnvelopedData, AuthenticatedData, and 
   AuthEnvelopedData, there are five algorithm related choices that need 
   to be made: 

   1) What is the public key size? 
   2) What is the KDF? 
   3) What is the key wrap algorithm? 
   4) What is the content encryption algorithm? 
   5) What is the curve? 

   Consideration must be given to strength of the security provided by 
   each of these choices. Security is measured in bits, where a strong 
   symmetric cipher with a key of X bits is said to provide X bits of 
   security. It is recommended that the bits of security provided by 
   each are roughly equivalent. The following table provides comparable 
   minimum bits of security [SP800-57] for the ECDH/ECMQV key sizes,

   2) What is the hash algorithm?

   Appendix A.1 provides the normative ASN.1 definitions for the 
   structures described in this specification using ASN.1 as defined in 
   [X.208]. 

   Appendix A.2 provides an informative ASN.1 definitions for the
