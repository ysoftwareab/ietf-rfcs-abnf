1. Introduction  
    
   This paper summarizes the recommended correlation between service 
   classes and their usage, with references to their corresponding 
   recommended Differentiated Service Code Points (DSCP), traffic 
   conditioners, Per-Hop Behaviors (PHB) and Active Queue Management 
   (AQM) mechanisms. There is no intrinsic requirement that particular 
   DSCPs, traffic conditioner PHBs and AQM be used for a certain 
   service class, but as a policy it is useful that they be applied 
   consistently across the network. 
    
   Service classes are defined, based on the different traffic 
   characteristics and required performance of the 
   applications/services. This approach allows us to map current and 
   future applications/services of similar traffic characteristic and 
   performance requirements into the same service class. With this 
   approach, a limited set of service classes is required. For 
   completeness, we have defined nine different service classes, two 
   for network operation/administration and seven for user/subscriber 
   applications/services. However, we expect that network 
   administrators will selectively choose the service classes that are 
   required in their network based on their needs. 
 

1.1 Expected use in the Network 

    
   In the Internet today, corporate LANs and ISP WANs are generally not 
   heavily utilized - they are commonly 10% utilized at most. For this 
   reason, congestion, loss, and variation in delay within corporate 
   LANs and ISP backbones is virtually unknown. This clashes with user 
   perceptions, for three very good reasons. 
     
     - The industry moves through cycles of bandwidth boom and 
       bandwidth bust, depending on prevailing market conditions and 
       the periodic deployment of new bandwidth-hungry applications. 
      
     - In access networks, the state is often different. This may be 
       because throughput rates are artificially limited, or because of 
       access network design trade-offs. 
      
     - Other characteristics, such as database design on web servers 
       (which may create contention points, e.g. in filestore), and 
       configuration of firewalls and routers, often look externally 
       like a bandwidth limitation. 
       
   The intent of this document is to provide a consistent marking, 
   conditioning and packet treatment strategy so that it can be 
   configured and put into service on any link which finds itself 
   congested.

1.2 Key Differentiated Services Concepts 
    
   The reader must be familiar with the principles of the 
   Differentiated Services Architecture [8]. However, we recapitulate 
   key concepts here so save searching. 
     

1.2.1 Queuing  

    
   A queue is a data structure that holds traffic that is awaiting 
   transmission. The traffic may be delayed while in the queue, 
   possibly due to lack of bandwidth, or because it is low in priority. 
   There are a number of ways to implement a queue; in some of these, 
   it is more natural to discuss "service classes in a queuing system" 
   rather than "a set of queues and a scheduler". In the literature, as 
   a result, the concepts are used somewhat interchangeably.  
    
   A simple model of a queuing system, however, is a set of data 
   structures for packet data, which we will call queues or service 
   classes and a mechanism for selecting the next packet from among 
   them, which we call a scheduler. 
     

1.2.1.1 Priority Queuing 
    
   A priority queuing system is a combination of a set of queues and a 
   scheduler that empties them in priority sequence. When asked for a 
   packet, the scheduler inspects the highest priority queue, and if 
   there is data present returns a packet from that queue. Failing 
   that, it inspects the next highest priority queue, and so on. A 
   freeway onramp with a stoplight for one lane, but which allows 
   vehicles in the high occupancy vehicle lane to pass, is an example 
   of a priority queuing system; the high occupancy vehicle lane 
   represents the "queue" having priority.  
    
   In a priority queuing system, a packet in the highest priority queue 
   will experience a readily calculated delay - it is proportional to 
   the amount of data remaining to be serialized when the packet 
   arrived plus the volume of the data already queued ahead of it in 
   the same queue. The technical reason for using a priority queue 
   relates exactly to this fact: it limits delay and variations in 
   delay, and should be used for traffic which has that requirement.  
    
   A priority queue or queuing system needs to support rate and burst 
   size control mechanism(s) to provide starvation avoidance of lower 
   priority queues. 
       

1.2.1.2 Rate Queuing 
    
   Similarly, a rate-based queuing system is a combination of a set of 
   queues and a scheduler that empties each at a specified rate. An 
  
Babiarz et al.            Expires April 2004                  [Page 4] 
Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes            October 2003 
 
   example of a rate based queuing system is a road intersection with a 
   stoplight - the stoplight acts as a scheduler, giving each lane a 
   certain opportunity to pass traffic through the intersection.  
    
   In a rate-based queuing system, such as WFQ[27][26] or WRR[28], the 
   delay that a packet in any given queue will experience is dependant 
   on the parameters and occupancy of its queue and the parameters and 
   occupancy of the queues it is competing with. A queue whose traffic 
   arrival rate is much less than the rate at which it lets traffic 
   depart will tend to be empty and packets in it will experience 
   nominal delays. A queue whose traffic arrival rate approximates or 
   exceeds its departure rate will tend to be not empty, and packets in 
   it will experience greater delay. Such a scheduler can impose a 
   minimum rate, a maximum rate, or both, on any queue it touches.  
    

1.2.2 Active Queue Management 
    
   "Active queue management" or AQM is a generic name for any of a 
   variety of procedures that use packet dropping or marking to manage 
   the depth of a queue. The canonical example of such a procedure is 
   Random Early Detection [25], in which a queue is assigned a minimum 
   and maximum threshold, and the queuing algorithm maintains a moving 
   average of the queue depth. While the mean queue depth exceeds the 
   maximum threshold, all arriving traffic is dropped. While the mean 
   queue depth exceeds the minimum threshold but not the maximum 
   threshold, a randomly selected subset of arriving traffic is marked 
   or dropped. This marking or dropping of traffic is intended to 
   communicate with the sending system, causing its congestion 
   avoidance algorithms to kick in. As a result of this behavior, it is 
   reasonable to expect that TCP's cyclic behavior is desynchronized, 
   and the mean queue depth (and therefore delay) should normally 
   approximate the minimum threshold.  
    
   A variation of the algorithm is applied in Assured Forwarding [11], 
   in which the behavior aggregate consists of traffic with multiple 
   DSCP marks, which are intermingled in a common queue. Different 
   minima and maxima are configured for the several DSCPs separately, 
   such that traffic which exceeds a stated rate at ingress is more 
   likely to be dropped or marked than traffic which was within its 
   contracted rate.  
    

1.2.3 Traffic Conditioning  

    
   Additionally, at the first router in a network that a packet 
   crosses, arriving traffic may be measured, and dropped or marked 
   according to a policy, or perhaps shaped on network ingress as in A 
   Rate Adaptive Shaper for Differentiated Services [23]. This may be 
   used to bias feedback loops, such as is done in Assured Forwarding 
   [11], or to limit the amount of traffic in a system, as is done in 
   Expedited Forwarding [19]. Such measurement procedures are 
  
Babiarz et al.            Expires April 2004                  [Page 5] 
Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes            October 2003 
 
   collectively referred to as "traffic conditioners".  Two traffic 
   conditioners that are use in deployment of differentiated services 
   that use Assured Forwarding are the Two Rate Three Color Marker 
   (trTCM) [18] and the Single Rate Three Color Marker (srTCM) [17].  
    
   Two Rate Three Color Marker: 
     The Two Rate Three Color Marker (trTCM) meters an IP packet stream 
     and marks its packets based on two rates, Peak Information Rate 
     (PIR) and Committed Information Rate (CIR), and their associated 
     burst sizes to be green, yellow, or red.  A packet is marked red if 
     it exceeds the PIR.  Otherwise it is marked either yellow or green 
     depending on whether it exceeds or doesn't exceed the CIR. The 
     trTCM is use to enforce committed rate separately from Peak 
     Information Rate. 
    
   Single Rate Three Color Marker: 
     The Single Rate Three Color Marker (srTCM) meters an IP packet 
     stream and marks its packets green, yellow, or red.  Marking is 
     based on a Committed Information Rate (CIR) and two associated 
     burst sizes, a Committed Burst Size (CBS) and an Excess Burst Size 
     (EBS).  A packet is marked green if it doesn't exceed the CBS, 
     yellow if it does exceed the CBS, but not the EBS and red 
     otherwise.  The srTCM is used to enforce the committed rate and 
     burst length. 
      

1.2.4 Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) 
    
   The DSCP is a number in the range 0..63, which is placed into an IP 
   packet to mark it according to the class of traffic it belongs in. 
   Half of these values are earmarked for standardized services, and 
   half of them are available for local definition.  
    

1.2.5 Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) 

    
   In the end, the mechanisms described above are combined to form a 
   specified set of characteristics for handling different kinds of 
   traffic, depending on the needs of the application. This document 
   seeks to identify useful traffic aggregates and specify what PHB 
   should be applied to them. 
     

1.3 Key Service Concepts 
    
   While Differentiated Services is a general architecture that may be 
   used to implement a variety of services, three fundamental services 
   have been defined and characterized for general use. These are basic 
   service for elastic traffic, the Assured Forwarding service, and the 
   Expedited Forwarding service for real-time (inelastic) traffic.  
    

  
Babiarz et al.            Expires April 2004                  [Page 6] 
Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes            October 2003 
 
   The terms "elastic" and "real-time" are defined in RFC 1633[2] 
   section 3.1, as a way of understanding broad brush application 
   requirements. This document should be reviewed to obtain a broad 
   understanding of the issues in quality of service, just as RFC 
   2475[8] should be reviewed to understand the data plane architecture 
   used in today's Internet.  
    
   The definition of "service class" is, a description of the overall 
   treatment of (or a subset of) a customer's traffic across a 
   particular domain, across a set of interconnected DiffServ Domain 
   (DS) domains, or end-to-end. Service descriptions are covered by 
   administrative policy and services are constructed by applying 
   traffic conditioning to create behavior aggregates which experience 
   a known PHB at each node within the DS domain. A service class 
   provides the specified end-to-end behaviors in the network which 
   will support one or more applications or a set of applications that 
   have similar traffic characteristics and performance requirements. 
   This concept allows grouping of applications of similar traffic 
   characteristics and performance requirements into a common 
   forwarding discipline called a "service class" that provides 
   consistent behavior in the administered network. (Service class 
   definition originates from RFC 2474 [7] section 2 definition of a 
   service) 
     

1.3.1 Default Forwarding (DF) 
    
   The basic services applied to any class of traffic are those 
   described in RFC 2474[7] and RFC 2309[6]. Best Effort Service may be 
   summarized as "I will accept your packets", with no further 
   guarantees. Packets in transit may be lost, reordered, duplicated, 
   or delayed at random. Generally, networks are engineered to limit 
   this behavior, but changing traffic loads can push any network into 
   such a state. 
     
   Application traffic in the internet is expected to be "elastic" in 
   nature. By this, we mean that the receiver will detect loss or 
   variation in delay in the network and provide feedback such that the 
   sender adjusts its transmission rate to approximate available 
   capacity. 
     
   For basic best effort service, a single DSCP value is provided to 
   identify the traffic, a queue to store it, and active queue 
   management to protect the network from it and to limit delays. The 
   interesting thing is that by giving that queue a higher minimum rate 
   than its measured arrival rate, we can effectively limit the 
   deleterious effects of congestion on a given class of traffic, 
   transferring them to another class that is perhaps better able to 
   absorb the impact or is considered to be of lower value to the 
   network administration. So, for example, if it is important to 
   service database exchange or transaction traffic in a timely 


  
Babiarz et al.            Expires April 2004                  [Page 7] 
Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes            October 2003 
 
   fashion, isolating the traffic into a queue and giving it a 
   relatively high minimum rate will accomplish that.  
    
   Scavenger, or less than best effort, service can also be provided, 
   for applications with congestion avoidance capabilities and is 
   considered to be of lower value to the network administration then 
   best effort traffic. 
    

1.3.2 Assured Forwarding (AF) 
    
   The Assured Forwarding RFC 2597[11] service is explicitly modeled on 
   Frame Relay's DE flag or ATM's CLP capability, and is intended for 
   networks which offer average-rate SLAs (as FR and ATM networks do). 
   This is an enhanced Best Effort service; traffic is expected to be 
   "elastic" in nature. The receiver will detect loss or variation in 
   delay in the network and provide feedback such that the sender 
   adjusts its transmission rate to approximate available capacity.  
    
   For such classes, multiple DSCP values are provided (two or three, 
   perhaps more using local values) to identify the traffic, a common 
   queue or class to store the aggregate and active queue management to 
   protect the network from it and to limit delays. Traffic is metered 
   as it enters the network, and traffic is variously marked depending 
   on the arrival rate of the aggregate. The premise is that it is 
   normal for users to occasionally use more capacity than their 
   contract stipulates, perhaps up to some bound. However, if traffic 
   must be lost or marked to manage the queue, this excess traffic will 
   be marked or lost first. 
     

1.3.3 Expedited Forwarding (EF) 

    
   Expedited Forwarding RFC 3246[19] was originally proposed as a way 
   to implement a virtual wire, and can be used in such a manner. It is 
   an enhanced best effort service: traffic remains subject to loss due 
   to line errors and reordering during routing changes. However, using 
   queuing techniques, the probability of delay or variation in delay 
   is minimized. For this reason, it is generally used to carry voice 
   and for transport of data information that requires "wire like" 
   behavior through the IP network. Voice is an inelastic "real-time" 
   application that sends packets at the rate the codec produces them, 
   regardless of availability of capacity. As such, this service has 
   the potential to disrupt or congest a network if not controlled. It 
   also has the potential for abuse.  
    
   To protect the network, at minimum one must police traffic at 
   various points to ensure that the design of a queue is not over-run, 
   and then the traffic must be given a low delay queue (often using 
   priority, although it is asserted that a rate-based queue can do 
   this) to ensure that variation in delay is not an issue, to meet 
   application needs.

1.3.4 Class Selector (CS) 
    
   Class Selector provides support for historical codepoint definitions 
   and PHB requirement. The Class Selector DS field provides a limited 
   backward compatibility with legacy (pre Diffserv) practice, as 
   described in RFC 2474 [7] section 4.  Backward compatibility is 
   addressed in two ways.  First, there are per-hop behaviors that are 
   already in widespread use (e.g. those satisfying the IPv4 Precedence 
   queuing requirements specified in [RFC 1812]), and we wish to permit 
   their continued use in DS-compliant networks. In addition, there are 
   some codepoints that correspond to historical use of the IP 
   Precedence field and we reserve these codepoints to map to PHBs that 
   meet the general requirements specified in RFC 2474 Sec. 4.2.2.2. 
    
   No attempt is made to maintain backward compatibility with the "DTR" 
   or TOS bits of the IPv4 TOS octet, as defined in [RFC 791]. 
    
   A DS-compliant network can be deployed with a set of one or more 
   Class Selector Compliant PHB groups.  As well, network administrator 
   may configure the network nodes to map codepoints to PHBs 
   irrespective of bits 3-5 of the DSCP field to yield a network that 
   is compatible with historical IP Precedence use. Thus, for example, 
   codepoint '011000' would map to the same PHB as codepoint '011010'. 
    

1.3.5 Admission Control 

    
   Admission control including refusal when policy thresholds are 
   crossed, can assure high quality communication by ensuring the 
   availability of bandwidth to carry a load. Inelastic real-time flows 
   like VoIP (telephony) or video conferencing services can benefit 
   from use of admission control mechanism, as generally the telephony 
   service is configured with over subscription, meaning that some 
   user(s) may not be able to make a call during peak periods. 
      
   For VoIP (telephony) service, a common approach is to use signaling 
   protocols such as SIP, H.323, H.248, MEGACO, RSVP, etc. to negotiate 
   admittance and usage of network transport capabilites. When a user 
   has been authorized to send voice traffic, this admission procedure 
   has verified that data rates will be within the capacity of the 
   network that it will use. Since RTP voice does not respond to loss 
   or marking in any substantive way, the network must police at 
   ingress to ensure that the voice traffic stays within its negotiated 
   bounds. Having thus assured a predictable input rate, the network 
   may use a priority queue to ensure nominal delay and variation in 
   delay. 
    
   Another approach that may be used in small and bandwidth constrained 
   networks for limited number of flows is RSVP[4][13]. However, there 
   is concern with the Scalability [5] of this solution in large 
   networks and Aggregation [15] of sessions is considered to be a 
   requirement.

1.3.6 Service Differentiation 
    
   There are practical limits on the level of service differentiation 
   that should be offered in the IP networks. We believe we have 
   defined a practical approach in delivering service differentiation 
   by defining different service classes that networks may choose to 
   support to provide the appropriated level of behaviors and 
   performance needed by current and future applications and services. 
   The defined structure for providing services allows several 
   applications having similar traffic characteristics and performance 
   requirements to be grouped into one service class and therefore 
   forwarded by single queue in a router. Also we provide a method for 
   different application (flows) within a service class to have unique 
   DSCP marking so that different conditioning and policing polices may 
   be used for different flows, through the use of Class Selector (CS) 
   codepoints or locally defined DSCP (EXP/LU) values and associating 
   them with the standardized PHBs. This approach provides a lot of 
   flexibility in providing the appropriate level of service 
   differentiation for current and new yet unknown applications without 
   introducing significant changes to routers or network configurations 
   when new traffic type is added to the network.   
    

2. Traffic Categories and Service Classes 

    
   This document divides traffic into five categories, one for network 
   control and four for user/subscriber traffic. The term "user" and 
   "subscriber" are used interchangeable in this document. Network 
   control traffic can further be divided into two service classes, 
   mainly flows that are critical, require lower delay or higher 
   probability of being serviced and normal network control flows.  
   User/subscriber traffic is broken down into four user traffic 
   categories, interactive, responsive, timely and non-critical as 
   defined by ITU-T Recommendation G.1010.  These four user traffic 
   categories can further be subdivided into one or more different 
   service classes within each traffic category to provide further 
   behavior differentiation. End-to-end performance requirements for 
   these traffic categories and service classes are further defined in 
   ITU-T Recommendation Y.1541, Y.1540 and G.1010. Additionally, 
   network administrators may choose to define other service classes. 
      
   The service classes define the required treatment for the traffic in 
   order to meet user, application or network expectations.  Section 3 
   in this document defines the service classes that may be used for 
   forwarding network control traffic and section 4 defines the service 
   classes that may be used for forwarding user traffic with examples 
   of intended application types mapped into each of their service 
   classes.  Note that the application types are only examples and are 
   not meant to be all-inclusive.  Also it should be noted that the 
   service class naming or ordering does not imply any priority 
   ordering.  They are simply reference names that are used in this 
   document with associated QoS behaviors that are optimized for the

   particular application types they support. Network administrators 
   may choose to assign different service class names, to the service 
   classes that they will support.  Table 1 below defines the 
   relationship between service classes and DS codepoint(s) assignment 
   with application examples.

     Table 2 provides a summary of DiffServ QoS mechanisms used for the 
     nine different service classes that are further defined in Section 
     3 and 4 of this document. Based on what applications/service that 
     need to be differentiation, network administrators can choose the 
     service class(es) that needs to be supported in their network. 
      
     Example 1: 
     A network administrator determines that they need in their network 
     to provide three different levels of network performance (quality 
     of service) for the services that they will be offering to their 
     customers. They need to enable their network to provide reliable

     VoIP (telephony) service, equivalent to PSTN. A low delay assured 
     bandwidth data service that customers will purchase plus access to 
     The Internet for basic connectivity. In this example, the network 
     administrator's needs are addressed with the deployment of the 
     following service classes: 
     - Standard service class for all traffic that will receive normal 
       (undifferentiated) forwarding treatment through their network. 
     - Telephony service class for VoIP (telephony) traffic.  
     - Low Latency Data service class for the differentiated data 
       service.  
     - Network Control service class for routing and control traffic 
       that is needed for reliable operation of the provider's network. 
      
     Example 2: 
     A network administrator determines that they need to support two 
     service classes for control and administration of their network 
     plus six levels of service differentiation for user traffic use the 
     following service classes: 
     - Administration 
     - Network Control 
     - Standard 
     - Telephony 
     - Low Latency Data 
     - High Throughput Data 
     - Multimedia Conferencing 
     - Multimedia Streaming 
 
     Example 3: 
     An enterprise network administrator determines that thy need to 
     provide seven levels of service differentiation for user traffic 
     plus one for running of their network. They would configure their 
     network to support the following service classes: 
     - Network Control 
     - Telephony 
     - Multimedia Conferencing 
     - Multimedia Streaming 
     - Low Latency Data 
     - High Throughput Data 
     - Standard 
     - Low Priority Data 
      
     It is expected that network administrators will choose the service 
     classes that they will support based on their need. Start off with 
     two or three service classes for user traffic and add others as the 
     need arises.

3. Network Control Traffic Category 
    
   Network control traffic is defined as packet flows that are 
   essential for stable operation of the administered network as well 
   for information that may be exchanged between neighboring networks 
   across a peering point where SLAs are in place. Network control 
   traffic is different from user application control (signaling) that 
   may be generated by some applications or services.  Network control 
   traffic is mostly between routers and network nodes that are used 
   for administering, controlling or managing the network segments and 
   the services that are provided in that network segment. A network 
   administrator may choose to split the network control traffic into 
   two service classes i.e., Administration and Network Control to 
   provide two different forwarding treatments or just support one 
   forwarding treatment for all network control flows. 
    

3.1 Administration Service Class 

    
   The Administration service class is intended to be used for control 
   traffic that is within a single administrative network domain. If 
   such traffic does not get through, the administered network domain 
   may not function properly. Example of such type of traffic is 
   heartbeats between core network switches/routers. Such heartbeats 
   are used to determine if the next hop is reachable. If no heartbeat 
   is received within a specified time interval, then the sending 
   router assumes that the particular link or next hop node is 
   unreachable on a particular interface and subsequently reroutes the 
   traffic to a backup interface that can reach the next hop node.  
   This reroute is typically done in a time interval much shorter than 
   the time it would take for the routing protocol to determine that 
   the next hop node is unreachable. 
    
   The Administration service class uses the DiffServ Class Selector 
   (CS) PHB defined in RFC 2474 [7] and should be configured to receive 
   sufficed forwarding resources so that all packets are forwarded 
   quickly.  The Administration service class should be configured to 
   use Priority Queuing system such as defined in Section 1.2.1.1 of 
   this document.  
    
   The following protocols and application should use the 
   Administration service class: 
     - Network administrator's telnet sessions from secure and trusted 
       terminals, Secure Shell (SSH) 
     - Protocol(s) that are transmitted between nodes within the 
       administered network for detecting of link and nodal failures 
     - Used for critical control traffic within an administrative 
       domain 
     - May be used for any control traffic that is forwarded within the 
       administered network domain such as NTP information that 
       requires very low delay variation (jitter) 
     - User traffic must not be mapped into this service class

Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes            October 2003 
 
     - Inter-network domain (across peering points) control traffic 
       should not be mapped into this service class 
    
   Traffic characteristics of packet flows in the Administration 
   service class: 
     - Mostly messages between routers and network servers 
     - Typically small packet sizes, one packet at a time 
     - Packets require immediate forwarding  
     - No user-to-user traffic is allowed to use this service class 
      
   Recommended DSCP marking is CS7 (Class Selector 7) 
    
   Network edge conditioning: 
     - Drop or remark CS7 marked packets at ingress to DiffServ network 
       domain.  
     - Depending on policy within the administered network, CS7 marked 
       packets may be dropped or remarked to CS6 at egress of DiffServ 
       network or across peering points. 
    

3.2 Network Control Service Class 
    
   The Network Control service class is used for transmitting packets 
   between network devices (routers, servers, etc.) that require 
   control information to be exchanged between different administrative 
   domains (across a peering point) and for non-critical network 
   control information exchange within one administrative domain. 
   Traffic transmitted in this service class is very important as it 
   keeps the network operational and needs to be forwarded in a timely 
   manner. 
    
   The Network Control service class uses the DiffServ Class Selector 
   (CS) PHB defined in RFC 2474 [7]. This service class is configured 
   so that the traffic receives a minimum bandwidth guarantee, to 
   ensure that the packets always receive timely service. The 
   configured forwarding resources for Network Control service class 
   should be such that the probability of packet drop under peak load 
   is very low in this service class. The Network Control service class 
   should be configured to use Rate Queuing system such as defined in 
   Section 1.2.1.2 of this document. 
    
   The following protocols and applications should use the Network 
   Control service class: 
     - Routing packet flows, OSPF, BGP, ISIS, RIP 
     - Policy management flows between nodes in the network, COPS, 
       RSVP-TE, etc. 
     - SIP-T signaling between high capacity telephony call servers or 
       soft switches.  Such high capacity devices may control thousands 
       of telephony (VoIP) calls.   
     - Network services, DNS, DHCP, BootP, high priority OAM (SNMP) 
       like alarms, etc.

     - Used for control information exchange within and between 
       different administrative domains across a peering point where 
       SLAs are in place. 
     - In 3GPP wireless solutions, used to transport UMTS 
       signaling/control information between wireless nodes 
     - User traffic must not be mapped into this service class 
    
   Traffic characteristics of packet flows in the Network Control 
   service class: 
     - Mostly messages between routers and network servers 
     - Ranging from 50 to 1,500 byte packet sizes, normally one packet 
       at a time but traffic can also burst (BGP) 
     - No user-to-user traffic is allowed to use this service class 
    
   Recommended DSCP marking is CS6 (Class Selector 6) 
    
   Network edge conditioning: 
     - At peering points (between two DiffServ networks) where SLAs are 
       in place, CS6 marked packets are policed using a single rate 
       with burst size (sr+bs) token bucket policer to keep the CS6 
       marked packet flows to within the traffic rate specified in the 
       SLA. 
     - CS6 marked packet flows from untrusted sources (end user 
       devices) are dropped or remarked at ingress to DiffServ network. 
       Packets from users are not permitted access to the Network 
       Control or Administration service classes. 
    
   If Administration service class is not supported, then the Network 
   Control service class is used for both normal network control 
   traffic and network administration traffic defined in this document 
   and packets marked with CS7 DSCP receive the same forwarding 
   treatment as CS6 marked packets.  
    

4. User Traffic Categories 
    
   User traffic is divided into four different categories, namely, 
   interactive, responsive and timely. An example of interactive 
   traffic is between two humans and is most sensitive to delay, loss 
   and jitter.  Another example of interactive traffic is between two 
   servers where very low delay and loss is needed. Responsive traffic 
   is typically between a human and a server but also can be between 
   two servers.  Responsive traffic is less affected by jitter and can 
   tolerate longer delays than interactive traffic.  Timely traffic is 
   either between servers or servers and humans and the delay tolerance 
   is significantly longer than responsive traffic. Non-critical 
   traffic is normal between servers/machines where delivery may be 
   delay for period of time. The Four traffic categories follow 
   methodology defined by ITU-T Recommendation Y.1541 and G.1010.  
    
   Network administrators can categorize their applications based on 
   the type of behavior that they require.  Table 1 provides some

Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes            October 2003 
 
   common applications and the forwarding service class that best 
   supports them based on their performance requirements.   
    
    
   In summary:  
     - Telephony service class is best suited for applications that 
       require very low delay and are of constant rate, such as IP 
       telephony (VoIP) and circuit emulation over IP applications.   
     - Multimedia Conferencing service class is best suited for 
       applications that require very low delay but are of variable 
       rate, such as video conferencing and interactive gaming.  
     - Multimedia Streaming service class is best suited for streaming 
       media applications such as broadcast TV, pay-per-view, video 
       surveillance and security, etc.   
     - Low Latency Data service class is best suited for interactive 
       client / server or client-to-client applications such as web-
       based ordering, EPR application, peer-to-peer signaling, etc.   
     - High Throughput Data service class is best suited for store and 
       forward applications such as FTP, billing record transfer, etc.   
     - Standard service class is for traffic that has not bean 
       identified as requiring differentiated treatment and is normally 
       referred as best effort.  
     - Low Priority Data service class is intended for packet flows 
       where bandwidth assurance is not required.  
      
   Note, a network administrator may choose to support all or subsets 
   of the defined service classes and provide service differentiation 
   only to the applications/service that are mapped into them.  
    
    

4.1 Interactive Traffic Category 
    
   Interactive traffic category can be further split into two service 
   classes, Telephony and Multimedia Conferencing to provide 
   differentiation based on the different behavior of source traffic 
   being forwarded.  
    

4.1.1 Telephony Service Class  

    
   Used for applications that require real-time, low delay, very low 
   packet loss for relatively constant-rate traffic sources (inelastic 
   traffic sources). This forwarding class is used predominantly for IP 
   telephony services and provides the low latency, jitter and loss 
   required. 
    
   The fundamental service offered to traffic in the Telephony service 
   class is a higher priority service than best-effort up to a 
   specified upper bound with low delay and very low packet loss. 
   Operation is in some respect similar to an ATM CBR service, which 
   has guaranteed bandwidth and if it stays within the negotiated rate 
  
Babiarz et al.            Expires April 2004                 [Page 17] 
Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes            October 2003 
 
   it experiences nominal delay and no loss. The EF PHB has a similar 
   guarantee. 
     
   Typical configurations negotiate the setup of telephone calls over 
   IP using protocols such as H.248, MEGACO, H.323 or SIP.  When a user 
   has been authorized to send telephony traffic, the call admission 
   procedure has verified that the newly admitted data rates will be 
   within the capacity of the Telephony service class forwarding 
   capability in the network that it will use. For VoIP (telephony) 
   service, the common approach is to use call admission control 
   performed by a telephony call server/gatekeeper using signaling 
   (SIP, H.323, H.248, MEGACO, etc.) on access points to the network. 
   The bandwidth in the core network and the number of simultaneous 
   VoIP sessions that can be supported needs to be engineered and 
   controlled so that there is no congestion for this service. Since 
   RTP telephony flows do not respond to loss or substantial delay in 
   any substantive way, the Telephony service class should forward 
   packet as soon as possible.  
     
   The Telephony service class uses Expedited Forwarding (EF) PHB as 
   defined in RFC 3246 [19] and must be configured to receive 
   guaranteed forwarding resources so that all packets are forwarded 
   quickly. The Telephony service class should be configured to use 
   Priority Queuing system such as defined in Section 1.2.1.1 of this 
   document. 
     
   Target applications for Telephony service class: 
     - VoIP (G.711, G.729 and other codecs) 
     - Telephony (trunk and/or stimulus) signaling between end device 
       (terminals/gateways) and the call server (H.248, MEGACO) 
     - Lawful Intercept 
     - Voice-band data over IP (modem, fax) 
     - T.38 fax over IP 
     - Circuit emulation over IP, virtual wire, etc. 
     - In wireless 3GPP applications, used to forward traffic that is 
       mapped into the UMTS Conversational Traffic Class 
    
   Traffic characteristics:  
     - Mostly fixed size packets for VoIP (60 or 70 or 120 or 200 bytes 
       in size) 
     - Packet emitted at constant time intervals 
     - Admission control of new flows is provided by telephony call 
       server, media gateway, gatekeeper, edge router or access node 
       that provides "middlebox" function. 
    
   Recommended DSCP marking EF for the following applications:  
     - VoIP (G.711, G.729 and other codecs) 
     - Lawful Intercept 
     - Voice-band data over IP (modem) 
     - Circuit emulation over IP, virtual wire, etc. 
     - Conversational UMTS Traffic Class 
    
   Recommended DSCP marking CS5 for the following applications:

     - Telephony (trunk and/or stimulus) signaling between end device 
       (terminals/gateways) and the call server (H.248, MEGACO) 
     - T.38 fax over IP 
    
   Both EF and CS5 DS codepoints are mapped into the Telephony service 
   classes and used the Expedited Forwarding (EF) PHB. The CS5 DS 
   codepoint is aliased to the EF codepoint and packets marked with CS5 
   are forwarded using the EF PHB.  
    
   Network Edge Conditioning: 
     - Packet flows from untrusted sources (end user devices) must be 
       policed at ingress to DiffServ network using single rate with 
       burst size token bucket policer to ensure that the telephony 
       traffic stays within its negotiated bounds.  
     - Packet flows from trusted sources (media gateways inside 
       administered network) do not require policing. 
     - Policing of Telephony packet flows across peering points where 
       SLA is in place is not required as telephony traffic will be 
       controlled by admission control mechanism between peering 
       points.   
    
   Note: On low speed links (typically access links below 1Mbps), in 
   the attempt to minimize jitter/delay, it is recommended that 
   packetized audio streams are separated from processed telephony data 
   information flows like T.38 fax and telephony signaling and 
   forwarded using less stringent from delay/jitter perspective service 
   class. PCM voice when compressed produces very small packets i.e. 60 
   bytes in size were T.38 fax and signaling packets can be much 
   bigger. The serialization delay, therefore delay/jitter for the 
   larger T.38 fax and signaling packets can be significantly bigger 
   over low speed links then for 60 byte voice packets. For this reason 
   it is recommended that packetized voice packets receive a higher 
   priority forwarding treatment then the less sensitive from 
   delay/jitter perspective T.38 fax and telephony signaling packets. 
   PCM audio streams (voice) have a strict end-to-end delay constrain 
   and should use Priority Queuing system where as T.38 fax or 
   telephony signaling have a more liberal jitter/delay constrain and 
   should use Rate Queuing system on access links below 1 Mbps.  
    
   On higher speed links the difference in serialization delay is very 
   small, therefore both types of telephony packet flows are aggregated 
   in to a single forwarding service class to simplify network 
   engineering and use Priority Queuing system. As well, the forwarding 
   of voice packets and signaling packets with the same very low delay 
   forwarding service class minimizes delay as well as the difference 
   in delay between signaling and bearer path, therefore virtually 
   eliminating speech clipping and ring-clipping problems at start of 
   call when interfacing to PSTN.

4.1.2 Multimedia Conferencing Service Class 
    
   Used for applications that requires real-time and low delay for 
   variable rate elastic traffic source. The traffic sources 
   (applications) in this traffic class have the capability to change 
   their emitting rate based on feedback received from the receiving 
   end. Detection of packet loss by the receiver is sent using the 
   applications control stream to the transmitter as an indication of 
   possible congestion. The transmitter based on pre-configured 
   encoding rates (or transmitting rates) selects a lower rate for 
   transmission.  
    
   Typical video conferencing configurations negotiate the setup of 
   multimedia session using protocols such as H.323 or SIP.  When a 
   user/end-point has been authorized to start a multimedia session the 
   admission procedure has verified that the newly admitted data rates 
   will be within the engineered capacity of the Multimedia 
   Conferencing service class. The bandwidth in the core network and 
   the number of simultaneous video conferencing sessions that can be 
   supported needs to be engineered to control traffic load for this 
   service.  
    
   The Multimedia Conferencing service class uses the Assured 
   Forwarding (AF) PHB defined in RFC 2597 [11]. This service class is 
   configured to provide a bandwidth assurance for AF41, AF42, and AF43 
   marked packets to ensure that they get forwarded. The Multimedia 
   Conferencing service class should be configured to use Rate Queuing 
   system such as defined in Section 1.2.1.2 of this document. 
    
   Target application for Multimedia Conferencing service class: 
     - Video conferencing (interactive video) 
     - Interactive gaming 
     - Server to server data transfer requiring very low delay 
     - IP VPN service that specifies two rates and mean network delay 
       that is slightly longer then network propagation delay. 
       Interactive, time critical and mission critical application 
       maybe encapsulated into this VPN service. 
     - In wireless 3GPP applications, used to forward traffic that is 
       mapped into the UMTS Interactive Traffic Class with Traffic 
       Handling Priority 1 (THP=1)  
    
   Traffic characteristics:  
     - Variable size packets (50 to 1500 bytes in size) 
     - Higher the rate, higher density of large packets 
     - Variable packet emission time  
     - Source capable of reducing its transmission rate based on 
       detection of packet loss at the receiver 
    
   Packet Marking: 
     - Interactive gaming packets are marked with AF41 
     - Video conferencing packets are marked with AF4x

Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes            October 2003 
 
     - VPN service may be marked with AF4x depending on the service 
       characteristics 
     - Server to server data transfer with AF4x depending on the 
       service characteristics 
     - UMTS Interactive THP=1 packets are marked with AF4x 
    
   Packet flows from video conferencing equipment may be marked at 
   source by the video conferencing equipment or by the edge router 
   using Two Rate Three Color Marked (trTCM) as specified in RFC 2698 
   [18]. 
    
   Example of DSCP marking when performed by video conferencing 
   equipment: 
     - AF41 = H.323 video conferencing audio stream RTP/UDP 
     - AF41 = H.323 video conferencing video control RTCP/TCP 
     - AF41 = H.323 video conferencing video stream below specified 
       rate "A" 
     - AF42 = H.323 video conferencing video stream between specified 
       rate "A" and "B" 
     - AF43 = H.323 video conferencing video stream above specified 
       rate "B" 
     - Where rate "B" is greater in magnitude than rate "A" 
    
   Conditioning Performed at DiffServ Network Edge: 
     The Two Rate Three Color Marker (trTCM) should be used as specified 
     in RFC 2698 [18]. 
      
     If packets are marked by the sources or previous DiffServ domain, 
     then the trTCM should be configured to operate in Color-Aware mode. 
      
     If the packets are not marked by the source or previous DiffServ 
     domain, then the trTCM must be configured to operate in Color-Blind 
     mode. 
    
   The fundamental service offered to "Multimedia Conferencing" traffic 
   is best effort service with controlled rate and delay. Some traffic 
   in this service class may not respond dynamically to packet loss. 
   For video conferencing service, typically a 1% packet loss detected 
   at the receiver triggers encoding rate change, drop to next lower 
   provisioned video encoding rate. As such, Active Queue Management 
   [6] is used primarily to switch video encoding rate under 
   congestion, change from high rate to lower rate i.e. 1472 kbps to 
   768 kbps. The probability of loss of AF41 traffic may not exceed the 
   probability of loss of AF42 traffic, which in turn may not exceed 
   the probability of loss of AF43 traffic.

4.2 Responsive Traffic Category 
    
   Responsive traffic category can be further split into two service 
   classes, Multimedia Streaming and Low Latency Data to provide 
   differentiation based on the different behavior of source traffic 
   being forwarded.  
    
    
    

4.2.1 Multimedia Streaming Service Class  

    
   The Multimedia Streaming service class is used for applications that 
   require near-real-time packet forwarding of variable rate traffic 
   sources which are not as delay sensitive as applications using the 
   Multimedia Conferencing service class.  Such applications include 
   broadcast TV, streaming audio and video, video (movies) on demand 
   and surveillance video.  In general, the Multimedia Streaming 
   service class assumes that the traffic is buffered at the 
   source/destination and therefore, is less sensitive to delay and 
   jitter. 
     
   The Multimedia Streaming service class uses the Assured Forwarding 
   (AF) PHB defined in RFC 2597 [11]. This service class is configured 
   to provide a minimum bandwidth assurance for AF31, AF32, AF33 and 
   CS4 marked packets to ensure that they get forwarded. The Multimedia 
   Streaming service class should be configured to use Rate Queuing 
   system such as defined in Section 1.2.1.2 of this document. 
    
   Target application for Multimedia Streaming service class: 
     - Video surveillance and security (unicast) 
     - TV broadcast including HDTV (multicast) 
     - Pay per view movies and events (pre scheduled) 
     - Video on demand (unicast) with control (virtual DVD) 
     - Streaming audio (unicast) 
     - Streaming video (unicast) 
     - Web casts 
     - VPN service that supports different levels of flow assurance 
     - In wireless 3GPP applications, used to forward traffic that is 
       mapped into the UMTS Streaming Traffic Class  
    
   Traffic Characteristics: 
     - Variable size packets (50 to 4196 bytes in size) 
     - Higher the rate, higher density of large packets 
     - Variable packet emission rate  
     - Some bursting at start of flow from some applications 
     - At about 2% packet loss, video session is usually terminated 
    
   Both the AF3x and CS4 DS codepoints are mapped into the Multimedia 
   Streaming service classes and used the Assured Forwarding (AF) PHB 
   however, Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanism is not applied in 
   the router(s) to CS4 market packets.

   Applications or end systems pre-mark their packets with DSCP values 
   as shown in Table 3 below. If host is unable to pre-mark their 
   packets, then marking is performed on the DiffServ edge router using 
   MF classification. Due to the nature of the service, it is 
   recommended that video surveillance and security flows are market 
   with a different DSCP value so that traffic conditioning and 
   policing policies can be different from other flows in the 
   Multimedia Streaming service class.

   Network Edge Conditioning: 
     Packet flows from untrusted sources must be policed at the DiffServ 
     network edge using single rate policers with a burst size control 
     for AF31, AF32, AF33 and CS4 marked packets. Policing policy is 
     based on the SLA for supported application(s). For the above 
     defined applications, three single rate policers with burst size 
     control should be provided; one for CS4 marked packets, another for 
     AF31 marked packets and the third policer for AF32 and AF33 marked 
     packets. Packet flows from trusted sources i.e. TV broadcast 
     servers, etc. normally do not require policing.

   The fundamental service offered to "Multimedia Streaming" traffic is 
   best effort service with controlled rate and delay. This traffic 
   does not respond dynamically to packet loss. Packets marked with 
   AF31 and CS4 DSCP requires very high assurance of delivery. Packets 
   marked with AF32 and AF33 can generally tolerated up to 1% and 2% 
   packet loss respectfully. As such, Active Queue Management [6] is 
   used primarily to reduce the number of flows at congestion points by 
   dropping packets from less important flows first before any AF31 and 
   CS4 marked packets are dropped. The service should be provisioned so 
   that CS4 and AF31 marked packet flows have high assurance for 
   bandwidth in the network. The probability of loss of CS4 traffic may 
   not exceed the probability of AF31 and AF31 traffic may not exceed 
   the probability of loss of AF32 traffic, which in turn may not 
   exceed the probability of loss of AF33.   
    

4.2.2 Low Latency Data Service Class  
    
   The Low Latency Data service class is used for elastic and 
   responsive typically client/server based applications.  Applications 
   forwarded by this service class are those requiring a relatively 
   fast response and typically have asymmetrical bandwidth need, i.e. 
   the client typically sends a short message to the server and the 
   server responds with a much larger data flow back to the client.  
   The most common example of this is when a user clicks a hyperlink 
   (~few dozen bytes) on a web page resulting in a new web page to be 
   loaded (Kbytes of data). This service class is configured to provide 
   good response for TCP [1] short lived flows that require real-time 
   packet forwarding of variable rate traffic sources. 
    
   The Low Latency Data service class uses the Assured Forwarding (AF) 
   PHB defined in RFC 2597 [11]. This service class is configured to 
   provide a minimum bandwidth assurance for AF21, AF22 and AF23 marked 
   packets to ensure that they get forwarded. The Low Latency Data 
   service class should be configured to use Rate Queuing system such 
   as defined in Section 1.2.1.2 of this document. 
    
   Target applications for Low Latency Data service class: 
     - Client / server applications 
     - SNA terminal to host transactions (SNA over IP using DLSw) 
     - Web based transactions (E-commerce) 
     - Credit card transactions 
     - Financial wire transfers 
     - ERP applications (.e.g. SAP / BaaN) 
     - Peer-to-peer signaling (SIP, H.323) 
     - VPN service that supports CIR (Committed Information Rate) with 
       up to two burst sizes  
     - In wireless 3GPP applications, used to forward traffic that is 
       mapped into the UMTS Interactive Traffic Class with Traffic 
       Handling Priority 2 (THP=2)

   Traffic Characteristics: 
     - Variable size packets (50 to 1500 bytes in size) 
     - Variable packet emission rate  
     - With packet bursts of TCP window size 
     - Source capable of reducing its transmission rate based on 
       detection of packet loss at the receiver or through explicit 
       congestion notification. 
    
   Both the AF2x and CS3 DS codepoints are mapped into the Low Latency 
   Data service classes and use the Assured Forwarding (AF) PHB 
   however, Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanism is not applied in 
   router(s) to CS3 market packets. 
    
   DSCP marking: 
     - Peer-to-peer inelastic SIP, H.323 signaling packer flows are 
       marked with CS3 
     - Elastic TCP flows are marked with AF2x  
     - VPN service may be marked with AF2x or CS3 depending on the 
       service characteristics 
     - UMTS Interactive THP=2 packets are marked with AF2x 
    
   Marking of the DSCP may be performed by a host or by an edge router.  
    
   Conditioning Performed at the DiffServ Network Edge: 
     Conditioning may be performed on per-flow or on aggregated-flows 
     depending on the configuration and service offered. Metering and 
     (re)marking of flows is required at DiffServ edge node and on 
     DiffServ boundary node.  The Low Latency Data service class uses a 
     Single Rate Three Color Marker (srTCM) conditioner for AF2x flows. 
      
   Conditioning Requirements for AF2x marked packets: 
     Conditioning of aggregated packet flows destined for the Low 
     Latency Data service class must be performed at the DiffServ edge 
     of the network. Furthermore, conditioning should be performed using 
     Single Rate Three Color Marker (srTCM) as defined in RFC 2697 [17].  
    
     If the packets are not pre-marked then the srTCM must be configured 
     to operate in the Color-Blind mode. 
      
     If the packets are pre-marked by the source or previous network 
     (boundary node) then the srTCM should be configured to operate in 
     the Color-Aware mode.  
      
   Conditioning Requirements for CS3 marked Packets: 
     DiffServ edge and boundary nodes must police CS3 marked packets so 
     both rate and burst size can be enforced.  
 
   The fundamental service offered to "Low Latency Data" traffic is 
   best effort service with controlled rate and delay. The service 
   should be engineered so that AF21 and CS3 marked packet flows have 
   sufficed bandwidth in the network to provide high assurance of 
   delivery. Since this traffic is marked with AF2x DSCP is elastic and 
   responds dynamically to packet loss, Active Queue Management [6] is

   used primarily to control TCP flow rates at congestion points by 
   dropping packet from TCP flows where the burst length is high. The 
   probability of loss of CS3 traffic may not exceed the probability of 
   loss of AF21 and AF21 traffic may not exceed the probability of loss 
   of AF22 traffic, which in turn may not exceed the probability of 
   loss of AF23. Active queue management may also be implemented using 
   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [17] method as defined in RFC 
   3168. 
    

4.3 Timely Traffic Category 
     
   Timely traffic category can be further split into two service 
   classes, High Throughput Data and Standard to provide 
   differentiation based on the different behavior of source traffic 
   being forwarded.  
    

4.3.1 High Throughput Data Service Class  

    
   The High Throughput Data service class is configured to support 
   elastic applications that require timely packet forwarding of 
   variable rate traffic sources and more specifically is configured to 
   provide good throughput for TCP longer lived flows. TCP[1] or a 
   transport with a consistent Congestion Avoidance Procedure[9][10] 
   normally will drive as high a data rate as it can obtain over a long 
   period of time. The FTP protocol is a common example, although one 
   cannot definitively say that all FTP transfers are moving data in 
   bulk.  
    
   The High Throughput Data service class uses the Assured Forwarding 
   (AF) PHB defined in RFC 2597 [11]. This service class is configured 
   to provide a minimum bandwidth assurance for AF11, AF12, AF13 and 
   CS2 marked packets to ensure that they are forwarded. The High 
   Throughput Data service class should be configured to use Rate 
   Queuing system such as defined in Section 1.2.1.2 of this document. 
    
   Target applications for High Throughput Data service class: 
     - Store and forward applications 
     - File transfer applications 
     - Email 
     - Non-critical OAM&P (Operation and Management and Provisioning) 
       using SNMP, XML, etc. 
     - VPN service that supports CIR (Committed Information Rate) with 
       up to two burst sizes  
     - In wireless 3GPP applications, used to forward traffic that is 
       mapped into the UMTS Interactive Traffic Class with Traffic 
       Handling Priority 3 (THP=3)   
    
   Traffic Characteristics: 
     - Variable size packets (50 to 1500 bytes in size) 
     - Variable packet emission rate

     - With packet bursts of TCP window size 
     - Source capable of reducing its transmission rate based on 
       detection of packet loss at the receiver or through explicit 
       congestion notification. 
    
   Both the AF1x and CS2 DS codepoints are mapped into the High 
   Throughput Data service classes and use the Assured Forwarding (AF) 
   PHB however, Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanism is not applied 
   in router(s) to CS2 market packets. 
    
   DSCP marking: 
     - Non-critical OAM&P (SNMP, XML, etc.) packets are marked with CS2 
     - Elastic TCP flows are marked with AF1x  
     - VPN service may be marked with AF1x or CS2 depending on the 
       service characteristics 
     - UMTS Interactive THP=3 packets are marked with AF1x 
    
   Note: Since the performance requirements for non-critical OAM&P 
   traffic can be met with the High Throughput Data service class and 
   the amount of non-critical OAM&P traffic is normally very small, we 
   recommend that non-critical OAM&P traffic be marked with CS2 DSCP 
   and forwarded using the High Throughput Data service class. The 
   marking of non-critical OAM&P traffic with CS2 DS codepoint is 
   recommended so that different conditioning, policing and queue 
   management policies can be used for non-critical OAM&P. 
    
   Marking of the DSCP may be performed by a host or by an edge router.  
    
   Conditioning Performed at the DiffServ Network Edge: 
     Conditioning may be performed on per-flow or for aggregated flows 
     depending on the configuration and the service offered. Metering 
     and (re)marking of DSCP is required at the DiffServ edge node and 
     on the DiffServ boundary node.  The High Throughput Data service 
     class uses a Single Rate Three Color Marker (srTCM) conditioner for 
     AF1x flows and a single rate policer with a burst size limit for 
     CS2 flows. 
    
   Conditioning Requirements for AF1x marked Packets: 
     Conditioning of aggregated packet flows destined for the High 
     Throughput Data service class must be performed at the DiffServ 
     edge of the network. Furthermore, conditioning should be performed 
     as defined in RFC 2697 [17].  
      
     If the packets are not pre-marked, then the srTCM must be 
     configured to operate in the Color-Blind mode. 
      
     If the packets are pre-marked by the source or previous network 
     (boundary node) the srTCM should be configured to operate in the 
     Color-Aware mode. 
    
   Conditioning Requirements for CS2 marked Packets: 
     DiffServ edge and boundary nodes must police CS2 marked packets so 
     both rate and burst size can be enforced.  
  
Babiarz et al.            Expires April 2004                 [Page 27] 
Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes            October 2003 
 
    
   The fundamental service offered to "High Throughput Data" traffic is 
   best effort service with a specified minimum rate. It can be assumed 
   that this class will consume any available bandwidth, and packets 
   traversing congested links may experience higher queuing delays 
   and/or packet loss.  
    
   Typical configurations use Explicit Congestion Notification [14] as 
   defined in RFC 3168 or random packet dropping to implement Active 
   Queue Management [6] and may impose a minimum or maximum rate. The 
   probability of loss of AF11 traffic may not exceed the probability 
   of loss of AF12 traffic, which in turn may not exceed the 
   probability of loss of AF13 traffic. Ingress traffic conditioning 
   passes traffic in the class up to some specified threshold marked as 
   AF11, additional traffic up to some secondary threshold marked as 
   AF12, and potentially passes additional traffic marked as AF13. In 
   such a case, if one network customer is driving significant excess 
   and another seeks to use the link, any losses will be experienced by 
   the high rate user, causing him to reduce his rate.  
    
   Packets marked with CS2 DSCP (OAM&P packets) should not be put 
   through Active Queue Management [6] function.   
    

4.3.2 Standard Service Class 
    
   The Standard service class is used for all traffic that has not been 
   classified into one of the other supported forwarding service 
   classes in the DiffServ network domain. This service class provides 
   the Internet's "best effort" forwarding behavior. This service class 
   typically has no bandwidth, delay, loss or jitter assurances. 
   The Standard service class uses the Default Forwarding (DF) PHB 
   defined in RFC 2474 [7] and should be configured to receive a small 
   percentage of forwarding resources (at least 5%). This service class 
   should be configured to use Rate Queuing system such as defined in 
   Section 1.2.1.2 of this document. 
    
   Target application for the Standard service class: 
     - Any undifferentiated application/packet flow transported through 
       the DiffServ enabled network 
     - In wireless 3GPP applications, used to forward traffic that is 
       mapped into the UMTS Background Traffic Class  
    
   Traffic Characteristics: 
     - Non deterministic, mixture of everything 
    
   The DSCP marking is DF (Default Forwarding) 
    
   Network Edge Conditioning: 
     There is no requirement that conditioning of packet flows be 
     performed for this service class.

Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes            October 2003 
 
   The fundamental service offered to the Standard service class is 
   best effort service with active queue management to limit over-all 
   delay. Typical configurations use Explicit Congestion Notification 
   [14] or random packet dropping to implement Active Queue Management 
   [6], and may impose a minimum or maximum rate on the queue. 
    

4.4 Non-Critical Traffic Category 
   Non-critical traffic category currently has only one service class 
   defined for differentiation from Standard traffic. When a need arise 
   other service class could be defined in the future.  

4.4.1 Low Priority Data Service Class 

    
   The Low Priority Data service class serves applications which run 
   over TCP [1] or a transport with a consistent congestion avoidance 
   procedure [9][10], and which the user is willing to accept service 
   without guarantees.  This service class is specified in [20]. 
    
   Target application for the Low Priority Data service class: 
     - Any TCP based application/packet flow transported through the 
     DiffServ enabled network that does not require any bandwidth 
     assurances. 
    
   Traffic Characteristics: 
     - Non real-time and elastic. 
    
   The DSCP marking is CS1 (Class Selector 1) 
    
   Network Edge Conditioning: 
     There is no requirement that conditioning of packet flows be 
     performed for this service class. 
    
   The fundamental service offered to the Low Priority Data service 
   class is best effort service with zero bandwidth assurance.  By 
   placing it into a separate queue or class, it may be treated in a 
   manner consistent with a specific service level agreement. 
    
   Typical configurations use Explicit Congestion Notification [14] or 
   random loss to implement active queue management [6].   
     

5. Mapping Applications to Service Classes 
    
   Here we provide some examples for mapping different applications 
   into the defined service classes. 
    
   Mapping for Signaling: 
    
   There are many different signaling protocols, ways that signaling is 
   used and performance requirements from applications that are 
   controlled by these protocols. Therefore we have determined that the 
  
Babiarz et al.            Expires April 2004                 [Page 29] 
Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes            October 2003 
 
   different signaling protocols be mapped to service classes that best 
   meet the objectives. The following mapping is recommended: 
     - SIP and H.323 are forwarded using Low Latency Data service class 
     - H.248 and MEGACO are forwarded using the Telephony service class 
     - SIP-T signaling between call servers in carrier's network using 
       Network Control service class. 
     - RSVP signaling, depends on the application. If RSVP signaling is 
       "on-path" as used in InServ or NSIS that it needs to be forward 
       from the same queue (service class) as application data that it 
       is controlling. If it is "off-path" not along the same path as 
       applications data than, Low Latency Data service class should be 
       used for RSVP signaling. 
    
   Mapping for NTP: 
    
   From tests that were performed, indications are that precise time 
   distribution requires a very low packet delay variation (jitter) 
   transport. Therefore we would suggest the following guidelines for 
   NTP be used: 
     - When NTP is used for providing high accuracy timing within 
       administrator's (carrier's) network, the Administration service 
       class should be used and NTP packets be marked with CS7 DSCP. 
     - When NTP is used for providing high accuracy timing to end 
       users/clients than the Telephony service class should be used 
       and NTP packets be marked with CS5 DSCP. 
     - For applications that require "wall clock" timing accuracy, the 
       Standard service class should be used and packets should be 
       marked with DF DSCP. 
    

6. Security Considerations 
    
   This document discusses policy, and describes a common policy 
   configuration, for the use of a Differentiated Services Code Point 
   by transports and applications. If implemented as described, it 
   should require the network to do nothing that the network has not 
   already allowed. If that is the case, no new security issues should 
   arise from the use of such a policy.  
    
   It is possible for the policy to be applied incorrectly, or for a 
   wrong policy to be applied in the network for the defined service 
   class. In that case, a policy issue exists which the network must 
   detect, assess, and deal with. This is a known security issue in any 
   network dependent on policy directed behavior.  
    
   A well known flaw appears when bandwidth is reserved or enabled for 
   a service (for example, voice transport) and another service or an 
   attacking traffic stream uses it. This possibility is inherent in 
   DiffServ technology, which depends on appropriate packet markings. 
   When bandwidth reservation or a priority queuing system is used in a 
   vulnerable network, the use of authentication and flow admission is 
   recommended. To the author's knowledge, there is no known technical

   way to respond to an unauthenticated data stream using service that 
   it is not intended to use, and such is the nature of the Internet.
