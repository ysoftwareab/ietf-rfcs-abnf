  A Cost Mode Registry for the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
                            (ALTO) Protocol
                       draft-bw-alto-cost-mode-01

Abstract

   This document creates a new IANA registry for tracking cost modes
   supported by the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
   protocol.  Also, this document relaxes a constraint that was imposed
   by the ALTO specification on allowed cost mode values.

   This document updates RFC 7285.

1.  Introduction

   The cost mode attribute indicates how costs should be interpreted
   when communicated in the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
   (ALTO) protocol [RFC7285].  The base ALTO specification includes a
   provision for only two modes:

   "numerical":  Indicates that numerical operations can be performed
      (e.g., normalization) on the returned costs (Section 6.1.2.1 of
      [RFC7285]).

   "ordinal":  Indicates that the cost values in a cost map represent
      ranking (relative to all other values in a cost map), not actual
      costs (Section 6.1.2.2 of [RFC7285]).

   Additional cost modes are required for specific ALTO deployment cases
   (e.g., [I-D.ietf-alto-path-vector]).  In order to allow for such use
   cases, this document creates a new ALTO registry to track new cost
   mode values (Section 4) and relaxes the constraints imposed by the
   base ALTO specification on allowed cost mode values (Section 3).

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC7285].

3.  Updates to RFC7285


3.1.  Update to Section 6.1.2 of RFC7285

   This document updates Section 6.1.2 of [RFC7285] as follows:

 OLD:
    The cost mode attribute indicates how costs should be interpreted.
    Specifically, the cost mode attribute indicates whether returned
    costs should be interpreted as numerical values or ordinal rankings.

    It is important to communicate such information to ALTO clients, as
    certain operations may not be valid on certain costs returned by an
    ALTO server.  For example, it is possible for an ALTO server to
    return a set of IP addresses with costs indicating a ranking of the
    IP addresses.  Arithmetic operations that would make sense for
    numerical values, do not make sense for ordinal rankings.  ALTO
    clients may handle such costs differently.

    Cost modes are indicated in protocol messages as strings.

 NEW:

   The cost mode attribute indicates how costs should be interpreted.
   This document defines two cost modes (numerical values or ordinal
   rankings), but additional values can be defined in the future.

   It is important to communicate such information to ALTO clients, as
   certain operations may not be valid on certain costs returned by an
   ALTO server.  For example, it is possible for an ALTO server to
   return a set of IP addresses with costs indicating a ranking of the
   IP addresses.  Arithmetic operations that would make sense for
   numerical values, do not make sense for ordinal rankings.  ALTO
   clients may handle such costs differently.

   Cost modes are indicated in protocol messages as strings.

3.2.  Update to Section 10.5 of RFC7285

   This document updates Section 10.5 of [RFC7285] as follows:

 OLD:
    A cost mode is encoded as a string.  The string MUST have a value of
    either "numerical" or "ordinal".

 NEW:

   A cost mode is encoded as a string.  The string MUST have a value
   that is listed in the registry created in Section 4 of RFCXXXX.

   *  Note to the RFC Editor: Please replace RFCXXXX with the RFC number
      to be assigned to this document.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to create a new subregistry entitled
   "ALTO Cost Modes" under the "Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
   (ALTO) Protocol" registry available at [ALTO].

   The registry is initially populated with the following values:

   +-------------+-----------------------------+
   | Cost Mode   | Specification               |
   +-------------+-----------------------------+
   | numerical   | Section 6.1.2.1 of RFC7285  |
   | ordinal     | Section 6.1.2.2 of RFC7285  |
   +-------------+-----------------------------+


   New values MUST be assigned after IETF Review (Section 4.8 of
   [RFC8126]).

5.  Security Considerations

   ALTO-related considerations are discussed in Section 15 of [RFC7285].

6.  Acknowledgements

   Many thanks to Benjamin Kaduk for spotting the issue during the
   review of [I-D.ietf-alto-path-vector].
