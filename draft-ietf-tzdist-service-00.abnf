lang=<lang-code>  OPTIONAL, but MAY occur multiple times.

tzid=<identifier>  OPTIONAL, and MAY occur multiple times.  MUST
         NOT be present if the "changedsince" parameter is present.  The
         value of the "dtstamp" member in the response applies to the
         entire set of data, rather than the subset requested with the
         "tzid" query parameter, and allows the client to determine if
         it needs to refresh its full set of time zone data.

format=<media-type>  OPTIONAL, but MUST occur only once.

lang=<lang-code>  OPTIONAL, but MAY occur multiple times.

tzid=<identifier>  REQUIRED, and MUST occur only once.

truncate=<year>  OPTIONAL, and MUST occur only once.  See
         Section 5.9 for details.

tzid=<identifier>  REQUIRED, but MUST only occur once.

lang=<lang-code>  OPTIONAL, but MAY occur multiple times.

start=year:  OPTIONAL, but MUST occur only once.  If present,
         specifies the start of the period of interest.  The value is an
         integer representing the starting year, with the start date
         assumed to be January 1st of that year.  If "start" is omitted,
         the value is assumed to be the current year.

end=year:  OPTIONAL, but MUST occur only once.  If present,
         specifies the ending year of the period of interest.  The value
         is an integer representing the ending year, with the end date
         assumed to be January 1st of that year.  If "end" is omitted,
         the value is the start year + 10.  Note that this is the
         exclusive end value - i.e., it represents the date just after
         the range of interest. e.g., if a client wants the expanded
         date just for the year 2014, it would use a start value of
         "2014" and an end value of "2015".  An error occurs if the end
         year is less than or equal to the start year.

name=<text>  REQUIRED, but MUST only occur once.

lang=<lang-code>  OPTIONAL, but MAY occur multiple times.
