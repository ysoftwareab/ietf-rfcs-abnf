1. Abstract 
    
   This document provides for the carriage of voicemail messages over 
   Internet mail as part of a unified messaging infrastructure. 
    
   The Internet Voice Messaging (IVM) concept described in this 
   document was originally called VPIM v3. This term has been dropped 
   to reflect the fact that it is not a successor format to VPIM v2, 
   but rather an alternative specification for a different application. 
    
    
 
2. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 
   [KEYWORDS]. 
    
    
 
3. Introduction 
    
   People naturally communicate using their voices, and this is 
   preferable to typing for some forms of communication. By permitting 
   voicemail to be implemented in an interoperable way on top of 
   Internet Mail, voice messaging and electronic mail need no longer 
   remain separate, isolated worlds and users will be able to choose 
   the most appropriate form of communication. This will also enable

   new types of device, without keyboards, to be used to participate in 
   electronic messaging when mobile, in a hostile environment, or in 
   spite of disabilities. 
    
   There exist unified messaging systems which will transmit voicemail   
   messages over the Internet using SMTP/MIME, but these systems suffer 
   from a lack of interoperability because various aspects of such a 
   message have not hitherto been standardized. In addition, voicemail 
   systems can now conform to the Voice Profile for Internet Messaging 
   (VPIM v2 as defined in RFC 2421 [VPIM2]) when forwarding messages to 
   remote voicemail systems, but VPIM v2 was designed to allow two 
   voicemail systems to exchange messages, not to allow a voicemail 
   system to interoperate with a desktop e-mail client, and it is often 
   not reasonable to expect a VPIM v2 message to be usable by an e-mail 
   recipient. The result is messages which cannot be processed by the 
   recipient (e.g., because of the encoding used), or look ugly to the 
   user. 
    
   This document therefore proposes a standard mechanism for 
   representing a voicemail message within SMTP/MIME, and a standard 
   encoding for the audio content, which unified messaging systems and 
   mail clients MUST implement to ensure interoperability. By using a 
   standard SMTP/MIME representation, and a widely implemented audio 
   encoding, this will also permit most users of e-mail clients not 
   specifically implementing the standard to still access the voicemail 
   message. In addition, this document describes features an e-mail 
   client SHOULD implement to allow recipient's to display voicemail 
   message in a more friendly, context sensitive way to the user, and 
   intelligently provide some of the additional functionality typically 
   found in voicemail systems (such as responding with a voice message 
   instead of e-mail). Finally is explained how a client MAY provide a 
   level of interoperability with VPIM v2. 
    
   It is desirable that unified messaging mail clients also be able to 
   fully interoperate with voicemail servers. This is possible today, 
   providing the client implements VPIM v2 [VPIMV2] in addition to this 
   specification, and uses it to construct messages to be sent to a 
   voicemail server. Separate work may be undertaken in the VPIM 
   Working Group to provide further interoperability between clients 
   implementing this specification and voicemail systems implementing 
   VPIM. 
    
   This definition is based on the IVM goals document [GOALS], which is 
   being revised to reflect subsequent discussions. This document is 
   partly derived from VPIM v2 [VPIMV2] as well as ongoing discussion 
   within the VPIM WG on IVM.  It references separate work on critical 
   content [CRITICAL], content hints [HINT]. Addressing issues are 
   discussed in a related Internet draft [ADDRESS]. Independent work 
   within the IETF is also addressing VPIM directory issues. 
    
   Further information on VPIM v2 and related activities can be found 
   at http://www.vpim.org. 
    
    
4. Message Format 
    
   All messages MUST conform with the Internet Mail format as it is 
   being defined by the DRUMS working group [DRUMSIMF].

                       Internet Voice Messaging          November 2000 
 
 
    
   The message header SHOULD indicate a content hint of "voice-message" 
   (see [HINT]). 
    
   If the receiving user agent identifies the message as a voice 
   message (from the content hint), it MAY present it to the user as a 
   voice message rather than as an electronic mail message with a voice 
   attachment. 
    
   Any content type is permitted in a message, but the top level 
   content type on origination of a new, forwarded or reply voice 
   message SHOULD be multipart/mixed. If the recipient is known to be 
   VPIM v2 compliant then multipart/voice-message MAY be used instead 
   (in which case all the provisions of [VPIMV2] SHOULD be 
   implemented). 
    
   If the message was created as a voice message, then the appropriate 
   audio body part SHOULD be indicated as critical content, via a 
   Content-Criticality parameter of CRITICAL (see [CRITICAL]). 
   Additional important body parts (such as the original audio message 
   if a voicemail is being forwarded) SHOULD also indicated via a 
   Content-Criticality of CRITICAL. Contents which are not essential to 
   communicating the meaning of the message (e.g. an associated vCard 
   for the originator) MAY be indicated via a Content-Criticality of 
   IGNORE. 
    
   The top level content type on origination of a delivery notification 
   message MUST be multipart/report. This will allow automatic 
   processing of the delivery notification - for example, so that text-
   to-speech processing can render a non-delivery notification in the 
   appropriate language for the recipient. 
    
    
5. Transport 
    
   The message MUST be transmitted in accordance with the Simple Mail 
   Transport Protocol as it is being defined by the DRUMS working group 
   [DRUMSMTP]. 
    
   Delivery Status Notifications SHOULD be requested [DSN] if delivery 
   of the message is important to the originator. 
    
    
6. Addressing 
    
   Any valid Internet Mail address may be used for a voice message. 
    
   It is desirable to be able to use and onramp/offramp for delivery of 
   a voicemail message to a user, which will result in specific 
   addressing requirements, based on service selectors as defined in 
   [SELECTOR]. Further discussion of addressing requirements for voice 
   messages can be found in the VPIM Addressing draft [ADDRESS]. 
    
   It is desirable to permit the use of a directory service to map 
   between the E.164 phone number of the recipient and an SMTP mailbox 
   address. How this might be achieved is currently under study in the 
   VPIM and ENUM working groups [VPIMENUM],[SCHEMA].

   If a message is created and stored as a result of call answering, 
   the caller's name and number MAY be stored in the message headers in 
   its original format per [CLID]. 
    
    
7. Notifications 
    
   Delivery Status Notifications MUST be supported.  All non-delivery 
   of messages MUST result in a NDN, if requested [DSN]. If the 
   receiving system is unable to process all of the critical media 
   types within a voice message (indicated by the content criticality), 
   then it MUST non-deliver the entire message.  
    
   Message Disposition Notifications SHOULD be supported (but according 
   to MDN rules the user MUST be given the option of deciding whether 
   MDNs are returned) [MDN]. 
    
   If the recipient is unable to display all of the indicated critical 
   content components indicated, then it SHOULD give the user the 
   option of returning an appropriate MDN (see [CRITICAL]). 
    
    
8. Voice Contents 
    
   Voice messages may be contained at any location within a message and 
   MUST be contained in an audio/WAV content-type, unless the 
   originator is aware that the recipient can handle other content. 
   Specifically, Audio/32KADPCM MAY be used when the recipient is known 
   to support VPIM v2 [VPIMV2]. 
    
   The VOICE parameter from VPIM v2 [VPIMV2] SHOULD be used to identify 
   the any spoken names or spoken subjects (as distinct from voice 
   message contents). 
    
   The originator's spoken name SHOULD be included with messages as 
   separate audio contents, if known, and indicated by the Content-
   Disposition as defined in VPIM v2 [VPIMV2]. If there is a single 
   recipient for the message, their spoken name MAY also be included 
   (per VPIM v2). A spoken subject MAY also be provided (per VPIM v2).  
    
   An implementation MAY determine the recipient capabilities before 
   sending a message and choose a codec accordingly (e.g. using some 
   form of content negotiation).  In the absence of such recipient 
   knowledge, implementations MUST use MS-GSM within the WAV file - 
   indicated via "audio/wav; codec=31". 
    
   Recipients MUST be able to play such a WAV encapsulated MS-GSM 
   message, and MAY be able to play G.726 (indicated as audio/32kadpcm) 
   to provide some interoperability with VPIM v2 [VPIMV2]. 
    
   An implementation MAY be able to play messages encoded with other 
   codecs (either natively or via transcoding) but MUST be able to 
   record WAV with MS-GSM. 
    
   An implementation MAY support interoperability with VPIM v2 
   [VPIMV2], in which case it MUST be able to record G.726 (indicated 
   as audio/32kadpcm).

   These requirements may be summarised as follows: 
    
      Codec       No VPIM v2 Support     With VPIM V2 Support 
                  Record    Playback     Record      Playback 
      ------      ------    --------     ------      -------- 
      WAV/MS-GSM  MUST      MUST         MUST        MUST
      G.726       MAY       MAY          MUST        MUST 
      Other       MAY       MAY          MAY         MAY 
 
                 Editor's Note:  Based on ongoing discussions in the 
                 VPIM WG, the baseline codec for IVM may be changed to 
                 G.711 mu-law indicated via "audio/basic" or 
                 "audio/wav; codec=7". 
    
    
9. Fax Contents 
    
   Fax contents SHOULD be carried according to RFC 2532 [IFAX]. 
    
    
10. Further Work 
    
   The above text provides some guidelines as to how to ensure that a 
   VPIM v2 message arriving on at a compliant mail system might be 
   rendered useful to the recipient. However, a thorough investigation 
   of interoperability with VPIM v2 is beyond the scope of this 
   document. 
    
   Other areas which are candidates to be referenced from this document 
   include: Content Negotiation (inc. RESCAP); the VPIM Directory work; 
   Spoken Header fields (embedded or references); the inclusion of 
   additional voice message specific header information in the RFC822 
   header; and a consideration of interoperability with e-mail clients 
   not supporting this specification. 
    
    
11. Security Considerations 
    
   It is anticipated that there are no additional security issues 
   beyond those identified in VPIM v2.
