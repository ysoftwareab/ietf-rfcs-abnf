1. Introduction

   Much development and deployment activity has centered around 2.5G
   (GPRS and EDGE) and 3G technologies (Wideband CDMA and cdma2000).  A
   primary motivation for these is data communication, and, in
   particular, Internet access. Accordingly, key issues are TCP
   performance and the several techniques which can be applied to
   optimize it over different wireless environments[1].

   This document proposes a profile of such techniques, (particularly
   effective for use with 2.5G and 3G wireless networks), derived from
   previous work at the IETF [30].

   Two example applications of the recommendations in this document
   are:

   The WAP Forum [13] is an industry association that has developed
   standards for wireless information and telephony services on digital
   mobile phones. In order to address WAP functionality for high speed
   networks such as 2.5G and 3G networks, and to aim at convergence
   with Internet standards, the WAP Forum thoroughly revised its
   specifications. The resultant version 2.0[18] adopts TCP as its
   transport protocol, and recommends TCP optimization mechanisms
   closely aligned with those described in this document.

   I-mode[24], with a huge subscriber base, is a wireless Internet
   service deployed on handsets in Japan.  The new version of i-mode
   that operates over W-CDMA is called FOMA[25]. It deploys the profile
   of TCP described in this document.

2. 2.5G and 3G Link Characteristics

   Link layer characteristics of 2.5G/3G networks have significant
   effects on TCP performance.  ARQ and FEC are discussed in[1].
   Justification for link layer ARQ is discussed in [9], [11].

   This section provides further details on a specific 3G technology,
   namely, Wideband CDMA (W-CDMA).

   W-CDMA (Wideband CDMA) uses RLC (Radio Link Control) [2], a
   Selective Repeat and sliding window ARQ. RLC uses protocol data
   units (PDUs) with 16 bit RLC header. There is an implementation with
   336 bits long PDU[25]. This is the unit for link layer
   retransmission. The SDU (IP packet) is fragmented into PDUs for
   transmission by RLC.

   In W-CDMA, one to twelve PDUs (RLC frames) constitute one FEC frame.
   The actual size of the FEC frame depends on the link conditions and
   bandwidth allocation. The FEC frame is the unit of interleaving.

   For TCP traffic, RLC has an acknowledge mode for PDU
   retransmitssion. RLC uses "status report" type acknowledgments: the
   poll bit in the header explicitly solicits the peer for a status
   report containing the sequence number that the peer acknowledged.
   The use of the poll bit is controlled by timers and by the size of
   available buffer space in RLC. Also, when the peer detects a gap
   between sequence numbers in received frames, it can issue a status
   report to invoke retransmission. RLC preserves the order of packet
   delivery

   The maximum number of retransmissions is a configurable RLC
   parameter that is specified by RRC [33] (Radio Resource Controller)
   through RLC connection initialization. The RRC can give the maximum
   number of retransmissions up to 40. Therefore, RLC can be described
   as an ARQ that can be configured for either HIGH-PERSISTENCE or
   LOW-PERSISTENCE, not PERFECT-PERSISTENCE, according to the
   terminology in [9].

   In general, the link layer ARQ and FEC can provide a packet service
   with a negligibly small probability of undetected error (failure of
   the link CRC), and a low level of loss (non-delivery) for the upper
   layer traffic, i.e. IP. The SDU (IP packet) is fragmented into PDUs
   for transmission. Retransmission of these by ARQ introduces latency
   and jitter to the SDU flow. This results in relatively large BDP
   (Bandwidth-Delay Product). Typical values may range around 50KB.

   The above explains why the transport layer sees the underlying
   W-CDMA network as a network with a relatively large BDP and jitter.
   The loss rate of IP packets is low due to the ARQ, but the recovery

3. TCP over 2.5G and 3G

3.1 Optimization Mechanisms

3.1.1 Large window size

   The traditional TCP specification limits the window size to 64 KB.
   If the end-to-end capacity is expected to be larger than 64 KB, the
   window scale option [5] can overcome that limitation. TCP over
   2.5G/3G should support appropriate window sizes based on the
   Bandwidth Delay Product (BDP) of the end-to-end path. If the
   estimated path BDP is larger than 64 KB, the window scale option may
   be used.

3.1.2 Large initial window

   TCP controls its transmit rate using the congestion window
   mechanism. Traditionally, the initial value of the window is one
   segment. Because the delayed Ack mechanism is widely deployed, a TCP
   sender should have an increased initial congestion window of two
   segments[3]. This effectively cancels the delayed Ack by sending two
   segments at once in the first RTT of slow start, which helps avoid
   overhead in the initial phase of the connection.

   Furthermore, the increased initial window mechanism[4] is also
   effective, especially for the transmission of small amounts of data,
   which is the behaviour commonly seen in such applications as
   Internet-enabled mobile wireless devices. For large data transfers,
   on the other hand, the effect of this mechanism is negligible. [6]
   describes evaluations of this mechanism by measurements.

   An initial congestion window size of two segments is recommended in
   RFC2581[3]. RFC2414[4] also considers the use of an initial window
   size larger than two segments. At the time of writing RFC2414 has
   been proposed to become a standards track RFC.

   Due to the fact that the delayed Ack mechanism is the standard, and
   that the increased initial window option is especially effective for
   the small data transfers that are common for mobile wireless
   devices, TCP over 2.5G/3G should use initial CWND (congestion
   window) = 2 segments. It may use a CWND > 2 segments between a
   gateway and a mobile node.

3.1.3 Limited Transmit

   RFC3042[27], Limited Transmit, extends Fast Retransmit/Fast Recovery
   for TCP connections with small congestion windows that are not
   likely to generate the three duplicate acknowledgements required to
   trigger Fast Retransmit. The mechanism calls for sending a new data

Internet-Draft    TCP over 2.5G and 3G Wireless Networks    October 2001


   segment in response to each of the first two duplicate
   acknowledgments that arrive at the sender. This mechanism is
   effective when the congestion window size is small or if a large
   number of segments in a window are lost. This may reduce the amount
   of retransmission due to TCP round trip timeout. Similar to the
   discussion in Section 3.1.2, this mechanism is useful for small
   amounts of data to be transmitted. TCP over 2.5G/3G implementations
   should implement Limited Transmit.

3.1.4 Large MTU

   One of the link layer parameters is MTU (Maximum Transfer Unit). In
   TCP, the slow start mechanism tries to find an adequate rate for the
   network path. A larger MTU allows TCP to increase the congestion
   window faster [10], because the window is counted in units of
   segments. In links with high error rates, a smaller link PDU size
   increases the chance of successful transmission. With layer two ARQ
   and transparent link layer fragmentation, the network layer can
   enjoy a larger MTU even in a relatively high BER (Bit Error Rate)
   condition. Without these features in the link, a smaller MTU is
   suggested. TCP over 2.5G/3G should allow freedom for designers to
   choose MTU values ranging from small values (such as 576 bytes) to a
   large value that is supported by the type of link in use (such as
   1500 bytes for IPv4 packets on Ethernet), although designers are
   generally encouraged to choose large values.

3.1.5 Path MTU discovery

   Path MTU discovery allows a sender to determine the maximum
   end-to-end transmission unit (without IP fragmentation) for a given
   routing path. RFC1191[19] and RFC1981[21] describe the MTU discovery
   procedure for IPv4 and IPv6 respectively. This allows TCP senders to
   employ larger segment sizes (without causing IP layer fragmentation)
   instead of assuming the small default MTU.  TCP over 2.5G/3G
   implementations should implement Path MTU Discovery. Path MTU
   Discovery requires intermediate routers to support the generation of
   the necessary ICMP messages. RFC1435[20] provides recommendations
   that may be relevant for some router implementations.

3.1.6 Selective Acknowledgments

   The selective acknowledgment option (SACK), RFC2018[7], is effective
   when multiple TCP segments are lost in a single TCP window[12]. In
   particular, if the end-to-end path has a large BDP and a certain
   packet loss rate, the probability of multiple segment losses in a
   single window of data increases. In such cases, SACK provides
   reliability beyond traditional and Reno TCP[8]. TCP over 2.5G/3G
   should support SACK.

Internet-Draft    TCP over 2.5G and 3G Wireless Networks    October 2001


3.1.7 Explicit Congestion Notification

   Explicit Congestion Notification, RFC3168[23], allows a TCP receiver
   to inform the sender of congestion in the network by setting the
   ECN-Echo flag upon receiving an IP packet marked with the CE bit.
   The TCP sender will then reduce its congestion window. Thus, the use
   of ECN is believed to provide performance benefits[22]. TCP over
   2.5G/3G may support ECN. RFC3168[23] also places requirements on
   intermediate routers (e.g. active queue management and setting of
   the CE bit in the IP header to indicate congestion). Therefore, the
   use of ECN is heavily dependent on the necessary support from the
   relevant routers.

4. Open Issues

   This section outlines additional mechanisms and parameter settings
   that may increase the end-to-end performance when running TCP across
   2.5G/3G networks. Note, that apart from the discussion of the RTO's
   initial value, those mechanisms and parameter settings are not part
   of any standards track RFC at the timing of writing, and can
   therefore not be recommended in general.

   Link layer mechanisms for increasing TCP performance include
   enhanced TCP/IP header compression schemes [16], and active queue
   management RFC2309[15]. Shortcomings of existing TCP/IP header
   compression schemes RFC1144[35], RFC2507[36] are that headers of
   handshaking packets (SYNs and FINs), and TCP option fields (e.g.,
   SACK or timestamps) are not compressed. In fact, the presence of
   timestamps effectively disables header compression based on RFC1144.
   Although RFC3095[34] does not yet address this issue, the ROHC
   working group is developing schemes to compress TCP headers,
   including options such as timestamps and selective acknowledgements.
   Especially, if many short-lived TCP connections run across the link,
   the compression of the handshaking packets may greatly improve the
   overall header compression ratio. Implementing active queue
   management is attractive for a number of reasons as outlined in
   RFC2309[15]. One important benefit for 2.5G/3G networks, is that it
   minimizes the amount of potentially stale data that may be queued in
   the network ("clicking from page to page" before the download of the
   previous page is complete). Avoiding the transmission of stale data
   across the 2.5G/3G radio link safes transmission (battery) power,
   and increases goodput (the ratio of useful data over total data
   transmitted). Another important benefit of active queue management
   for 2.5G/3G networks, is that it reduces the risk of a spurious
   timeout for the first data segment as outlined below.

   Finding ways to avoid the round-trip times required for TCP's
   connection setup and disconnect is particularly attractive for
   2.5G/3G networks since these networks are commonly characterized by
   high delays. This would be particularly beneficial for short-lived,
   transactional (request/response-style) TCP sessions that typically
   result from browsing the Web from a smart phone. However, existing
   solutions such as T/TCP RFC1644[14], have not been adopted due to
   its security concerns [31].

   Spurious timeouts, packet re-ordering, and packet duplication may
   reduce TCP's performance. Thus, making TCP more robust against those
   events is desirable. Solutions to this problem have been proposed
   [17], [26], [37], and standardization work within the IETF is
   ongoing at the time of writing. Those solutions include reversing
   congestion control state after such an event has been detected, and
   adapting the retransmission timer and duplicate acknowledgement


Inamura, et. al.         Expires April 17, 2002                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft    TCP over 2.5G and 3G Wireless Networks    October 2001


   threshold. The deployment of such solutions may be particularly
   beneficial when running TCP across wireless networks. This is since
   wireless access links may often be subject to handovers and resource
   preemption, or the mobile transmitter may traverse through a radio
   coverage hole. Such disrupting events may easily trigger a spurious
   timeout despite a conservative retransmission timer. Also, the
   mobility mechanisms of some wireless networks may cause packet
   duplication.

   The algorithm for computing TCP's retransmission timer is specified
   in [32]. The initial setting of the retransmission timeout value
   (RTO) is specified as 3 seconds. This value might be too low when
   running TCP across 2.5G/3G networks. In addition to its high
   latencies, those networks may be run at bit rates of as low as about
   10 kb/s which results in large transmission delays. In this case,
   the RTT for the first data segment may easily be beyond the initial
   retransmission timer setting of 3 seconds. This would then cause a
   spurious timeout for that segment. Hence, in such situations it may
   be advisable to set TCP's initial RTO to a value larger than 3
   seconds. Furthermore, due to the potentially large transmissions
   delays, a TCP sender might choose to refrain from initializing its
   RTO from the RTT measured for the SYN, but instead take the RTT
   measured for the first data segment.

5. Security Considerations

   In 2.5G/3G wireless networks, data is transmitted as ciphertext over
   the air and as cleartext between the Radio Access Network (RAN) and
   the core network. IP security RFC2411[29] or TLS RFC2246[28] can be
   deployed by user devices for end-to-end security. The use of a
   transport gateway as mentioned in Section 3.1.2 introduces conflicts
   with IPsec; however TLS can be used in such architectures.
