1. Introduction 

1.1. SEED 

   SEED is a national industrial association standard [TTASSEED] and is 
   widely used in South Korea for electronic commerce and financial 
   services that are operated on wired and wireless communications. 

   SEED is a 128-bit symmetric key block cipher that had been developed 
   by KISA(Korea Information Security Agency) and a group of experts 
   since 1998. The input/output block size of SEED is 128-bit and the 
   key length is also 128-bit. SEED has the 16-round Feistel structure. 
   A 128-bit input is divided into two 64-bit blocks and the right 64-
   bit block is an input to the round function with a 64-bit subkey 
   generated from the key scheduling. 

   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in 
   [ISOSEED] [SEED]. The SEED homepage, http://www.kisa.or.kr, contains 
   a wealth of information about SEED, including detailed specification, 
   evaluation report, test vectors, and so on. 

2. SEED encryption 

   Section 4.1.1 of [RFC3711] defines AES counter mode encryption, which 
   it refers to as AES-CM. SEED counter mode is defined in a similar 
   manner, and is denoted as SEED-CM respectively. The plaintext inputs 
   to the block cipher are formed as in AES-CM, and the block cipher 
   outputs are processed as in AES-CM. The only difference in the 
   processing is that SEED-CM use SEED. SEED-CM use a 112-bit salt as an 
   input, as does AES-CM.

3. SEED-CM PRF 

   Section 4.3.3 of [RFC3711] defines AES counter mode key derivation 
   function, which it refers to as "AES-CM PRF". The SEED PRF is defined 
   in a similar manner, and is denoted as SEED-CM PRF. The only 
   difference in the processing is that SEED-CM PRF uses SEED. SEED-CM 
   PRF uses a 112-bit salt as an input, as done the AES-CM PRF.

5. Security Considerations 

   No security problem has been found on SEED. SEED is secure against 
   all known attacks including differential cryptanalysis, linear 
   cryptanalysis, and related key attacks. The best known attack is only 
   an exhaustive search for the key. For further security considerations, 
   the reader is encouraged to read [CRYPTREC] and [SEED-EVAL].
