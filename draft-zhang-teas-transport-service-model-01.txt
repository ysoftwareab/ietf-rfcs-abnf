    A Service YANG Model for Connection-oriented Transport Networks
              draft-zhang-teas-transport-service-model-01

Abstract

   A transport network is a server-layer network designed to provide
   connectivity services for a client-layer network to carry the client
   traffic opaquely across the server-layer network resources.  A
   transport network may be constructed from equipments utilizing any of
   a number of different transport technologies such as the evolving
   optical transport infrastructure (Synchronous Optical Networking
   (SONET) / Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and Optical Transport
   Network (OTN)) or packet transport as epitomized by the MPLS
   Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).

   This draft provides a transport service YANG model that can be used
   together with the RESTCONF protocol for a northbound client to
   initiate service requests toward the transport network controllers
   via the RESTful interface between them so as to enable automated
   service interations.

1.  Introduction

   A transport network is a server-layer network designed to provide
   connectivity services, or more advanced services like Virtual Private
   Networks (VPN) for a client-layer network to carry the client traffic
   opaquely across the server-layer network resources.  It acts as a
   pipe provider for upper-layer networks, such as IP network and mobile
   networks.

   Transport networks, such as Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) /
   Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), Optical Transport Network (OTN),
   Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), and flexi-grid networks, are
   often built using equipments from a single vendor and are managed
   using private interfaces to dedicated Element Management Systems

   (EMS) / Network Management Systems (NMS).  All transport networks
   have high benchmarks for reliability and operational simplicity.
   This suggests a common, technology-independent management/control
   paradigm that is extended to represent and configure specific
   technology attributes.

   The YANG language [RFC6020] is currently the data modeling language
   of choice within the IETF and has been adopted by a number of
   industry-wide open management and control initiatives.  YANG may be
   used to model both configuration and operational states; it is
   vendor-neutral and supports extensible APIs for control and
   management of elements.

   This document, exploting the YANG language, provides a transport
   service model that can be used by a northbound client (e.g., an
   orchestrator, a client network controller etc.) to initiate service
   requests, as well as retrieving service states, toward the transport
   network via the RESTful interface provided by the transport network
   controller(s).  The model is currently scoped for connection-oriented
   transport networks and connection-less transport networks are out of
   scope.  To understand better what interfaces a service model can
   apply to in the transport SDN architecture (i.e., Abstract Control of
   Transport Networks (ACTN))and how service model relates to other YANG
   models defined in IETF in general, please refer to
   [I-D.zhang-teas-actn-yang]  for more detailed information.

2.  Terminology

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in the YANG data tree
   presented later in this draft is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc6087bis].  They are provided below for reference.

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

5.  General Considerations and Some Open Issues

   [I-D.liu-netmod-yang-schedule] defines a YANG data model for
   configuration scheduling.  A service model can also be scheduled,
   therefore the ietf-schedule model can be used to serve this purpose
   by specifying the appropriate object using xpath.

   Functions that are under considerations for updating the YANG model:

      1): Service delivery model augmentation: Information such as PIR/
      CIR pertaining to ETH service is needed and it is more appropriate
      to augment the base model; for OTN-based service model, signal-
      type information needs to be added;

      2): To add service-related notification, e.g.: service up; service
      down, service degraded etc.; Currently, there are two options
      available, one is using the method provided in [RFC5277], the
      other one is using the new mechanism proposed in
      [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push].

      3): To figure out how to deal with attributes such as bandwidth,
      schedule where it can be per node for non-P2P, but is per node
      pair for P2P;

      4): to add XRO/IRO constraints;

6.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.

7.  Manageability Considerations

   TBD

8.  Security Considerations

   Since the data model defined in this draft is manipulated via, for
   example, the interface between an orchestrator and a transport
   network controller.  The YANG module defined in this draft is
   designed to be accessed via the RESTCONF protocol defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf], or maybe via the NETCONF protocol
   [RFC6241].  As mentioned in Security Conserations Section of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf] that HTTPS defined in [RFC7230] can be
   used to provide security while accessing data.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., POST) to these
   data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   Editor note: to List specific subtrees and data nodes and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability.

   discussions that trigger the generation of this draft.  We would also
   like to thank Michael Scharf from Nokia for very useful comments to
   this draft and the model.
