1.  Terminology

   This document uses terms from [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework] and
   [RFC3428].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   The SIP MESSAGE method [RFC3428] is used for page-mode messaging.  In
   page mode, each individual message is sent independently and not as
   part of any session.  On the other hand, there are session-mode text
   messaging standards such as the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)
   [RFC4975] and Real Time Text (RTT) [RFC5194] where every message is
   part of an explicit session.

   Which mode to use in an emergency situation depends on what the
   endpoint is capable of.  Short Message Service (SMS), for example, is
   page-mode messaging.  If caller wants to use SMS to send emergency
   text messages, a page-mode mechanism must be used.  Some types of
   Instant Messaging (IM) systems work as page-mode messaging as well.

   This document describes how the SIP MESSAGE method is used to support
   emergency text messaging within the framework described in
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework].  The existing framework does not consider
   methods, such as the SIP MESSAGE method, that do not create a session
   or are not a part of it.  This document describes how to deliver
   multiple SIP MESSAGE requests consistently to the same call taker.
   It also describes how non-SIP text messaging content can be converted
   to SIP MESSAGE requests.

   Presence is beyond the scope of this document.

            Figure 1: Flow of Page-mode Emergency Text Messages

   This document assumes that the Emergency Services IP Network (ESInet)
   and Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) are SIP-based
   infrastructures.  The caller-facing access network may or may not be
   SIP-based or IP-based.  As shown in Figure 1, emergency text messages
   may be sent end-to-end from a SIP User Agent using SIP MESSAGE
   requests.  It may also be sent in a different format and protocol,
   such as SMS, and converted to SIP MESSAGE requests somewhere along
   the path towards the call taker.  Gateways, such as the SMS gateway
   shown in Figure 1, handles these conversions.  Conversion is
   described in Section 6.

   The SIP MESSAGE request is constructed as described in [RFC3428].
   The body of the request contains the text message to be delivered.
   Then the values for various emergency header fields are filled as
   stated in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework].  If the location information is
   appended to the body of the request, the caller's message and the
   location information must be inserted into the body of the request as
   multiple MIME attachments.  These are explained in more detail in
   Section 4.

   The main difference of this approach from both the traditional SIP
   MESSAGE request routing and the emergency framework is in the way the
   SIP MESSAGE request is handled along the signaling path.  In
   emergency handling, the path that the first SIP MESSAGE request takes
   is important.  Subsequent SIP MESSAGE requests from the same person
   or device must follow the same path as the first one so that they are
   delivered correctly to the same call taker.  Otherwise, if subsequent
   SIP MESSAGE requests are delivered to another call taker or another
   PSAP, there will be considerable confusion for both the sender and
   the receiver.  Therefore, the path of the first SIP MESSAGE request
   is determined by location and/or local policy, but all subsequent SIP
   MESSAGE requests must follow the path of the first request regardless
   of location or local policy.

   This means that entities within the signaling path that determine the
   next hop based on location or local policy need to keep track of SIP
   MESSAGE requests that it forwards.  Emergency Service Routing Proxy
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework] is an example of such entity.  How such
   proxy behaves is described in Section 5.  However, this behavior is
   not confined to proxies.  SIP UAs and call distributing entities
   within the PSAPs are also affected.  If the SIP UA does not keep
   track of SIP MESSAGE requests, then it would query LoST [RFC5222]
   every time a SIP MESSAGE is sent.  This is a big problem if the
   caller is moving while sending messages; the SIP UA may send the SIP
   MESSAGE requests to different PSAPs based on LoST query results.
   Call distributing entities need to keep track of SIP MESSAGE requests
   so that requests from one caller is forwarded consistently to one
   call taker.  For these entities, the same state-keeping mechanisms
   described in Section 5 can be used.

   When the call taker sends a reply to the caller, the reply follows
   the normal SIP routing path.  If the caller's original message was
   not SIP, then the replies from the call taker must also be converted
   from SIP MESSAGE requests to the original message format and
   transport protocol.  As an example, if the caller's original message
   was an SMS message, then the call taker's replies to be converted to
   an SMS message so that the caller can receive it on his/her cell
   phone.  There may be other protocols, such as proprietary IM
   protocols, that may need conversion.


4.  Caller UAC Processing

   Caller UAC follows the rules of SIP MESSAGE method[RFC3428] and those
   of [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework].  The following description of caller
   UAC processing is derived from the union of the two documents
   mentioned earlier.

   The UAC may include location information in the body as type "xml/
   pidf-lo" with a corresponding Geolocation header field, or include a
   reference to the location information in the Geolocation header field
   as specified in [I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance].  In the former
   case, the UAC needs to include both the sender's message and the
   location information in one body.  To do so, the UAC must use
   multipart MIME.  Here is an example:

   The UAC should resolve the location to a URI by querying LoST
   [RFC5222] and should include the URI in the Route header field.  This
   should be done only once for the initial SIP MESSAGE request to make
   sure that all subsequent SIP MESSAGE requests follow the same next-
   hop as the first request.  If the UAC is not able to resolve the
   location, then it should not include a Route header field.

Internet-Draft               Emergency Text                   April 2011


   If the UAC receives a non-200 response, it should notify the sender
   of the response and give the sender the option of dialing the
   emergency number instead of sending another SIP MESSAGE request.


5.  Proxy Processing

   As described in Section 3, proxies that determine the next hop of an
   emergency request based on location or local policy need to keep
   track of SIP MESSAGE requests they handle.  On the other hand,
   proxies that forward SIP MESSAGE requests statically, i.e., based on
   the To header field or the Route header field, do not need to keep
   track since the SIP MESSAGE requests will be delivered consistently.

   The proxies that need to track SIP MESSAGE requests, e.g., the
   Emergency Services Routing Proxy [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework], MUST
   perform additional record keeping for SIP MESSAGE requests if all of
   the following conditions are met.

   1.  The destination (obtained from the To header field) is
       urn:service:sos.

   2.  This is the first SIP MESSAGE request from a particular source
       (obtained from the From header field).  In other words, the proxy
       has no record of the source sending a SIP MESSAGE request to
       urn:service:sos.

   The record is a (source, next-hop, expiration timer) triplet.  The
   source is obtained from the From header field of the request.  The
   next-hop is determined by a LoST query [RFC5222] based on the
   location information or a reference to the location information
   within the first request.  Location information in subsequent
   requests do not affect the next-hop value.  The expiration timer is a
   value in seconds during which the record will be preserved in the
   proxy.  Each subsequent request resets the expiration timer.  For
   example, if the configured value of the expiration timer is 30
   seconds, then the countdown begins after the first request is
   processed.  When the second request comes in, the expiration timer is
   reset to 30 seconds and the countdown starts again.  If the timer
   falls to zero, the record is no longer valid.

   Proxies route all subsequent SIP MESSAGE request from the same source
   to the same next-hop while the expiration timer is greater than zero.
   Each subsequent SIP MESSAGE request resets the expiration timer to
   its maximum value.  This is to ensure that a 'conversation' between
   the caller and the call taker is consistent.

6.  Conversion to SIP MESSAGE

   The original message may not be SIP.  It may be an SMS message or an
   IM message in a proprietary format and protocol.  In these cases, the
   original format and protocol must be converted to a SIP MESSAGE
   request.

   The following is the minimum information needed to convert a non-SIP
   message to a valid SIP MESSAGE request.

   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | Type of      | Corresponding SIP MESSAGE element                  |
   | Information  |                                                    |
   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | Origination  | From header field                                  |
   | address or   |                                                    |
   | number       |                                                    |
   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | User message | In the body as type "text/plain"                   |
   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | Location     | Geolocation header field and in the body as type   |
   | information  | "xml/pidf-lo" (Geolocation header field only if    |
   |              | conveying location by reference)                   |
   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+

   The SIP URI for the From header field must be created by merging the
   origination address or number and the IP address and port of the
   converting entity.  The IP address and port of the converting entity
   is needed for reply message from the call taker to reach the caller.
   For example, let's say the origination address or number is 123-456-
   7890 and the IP address and port number of the converting entity is
   128.59.19.184:5060.  Then the SIP URI should be
   sip:1234567890@128.59.19.184:5060.

   The To header field must contain an emergency string such as
   "urn:service:sos".  The destination address or number, e.g., 9-1-1,
   in the original non-SIP message is retained and carried along with
   the SIP message in the History-Info header [RFC4244].  The
   destination address could be useful in post incident call analysis
   for PSAP personnel to identify network issues such as mis-routed text
   messages allowing more efficient trouble clearing with the
   appropriate network provider.

   The next hop entity should be determined by querying LoST with the
   provided location information and it should be included in the Route
   header field.

   If the converter receives a 200 OK response, it should send a success



Kim, et al.              Expires October 6, 2011                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               Emergency Text                   April 2011


   indicator to the original sender.  There may not be a one-to-one
   match between SIP responses and the original protocol, especially
   when non-200 responses are received.  In this case, the converter
   must indicate failure and may send the reason text as a message to
   the sender.

   The call taker's reply, which is another SIP MESSAGE request in the
   reverse direction, should be sent to the origination address or
   number in its original format.  The origination address or number can
   be extracted from the To header field.  The From header field may
   contain "urn:service:sos", in which case it must be replaced with the
   original emergency number or string.

   If the sender protocol allows provisional and final responses, the
   converter should make use of them to indicate the status of the call
   taker.  For example, the converter should send a 202 Accepted
   response upon receiving the call taker's SIP MESSAGE request, and
   then a 200 OK upon receiving the final success indication from the
   sender.  If the sender protocol does not allow such elaborate
   responses, the converter must send a 200 OK upon receiving the call
   taker's SIP MESSAGE request.
