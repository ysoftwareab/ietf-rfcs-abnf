<h1><br />A Scalable Addressing Allocation Architecture for IPv6<br />draft-azinger-scalable-addressing-01</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
	This document presents a scalable architecture for assigning and
	aggregating IPv6 address space.  The current IPv4 assignment and
	addressing architecture has been successful in helping to scale the
	IPv4 routing architecture.  This same architecture, when carried
	forward to IPv6, will help to ensure that the IPv6 routing
	architecture is sustainable.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
	This document presents a scalable architecture for assigning and
	aggregating IPv6 address space.  The current IPv4 addressing
	aggregation strategy was defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC1519'>[RFC1519]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Fuller, V., Li, T., Yu, J., and K. Varadhan, &ldquo;Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR): an Address Assignment and Aggregation Strategy,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1993.</span><span>)</span></a> (and
	updated in <a class='info' href='#RFC4632'>[RFC4632]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Fuller, V. and T. Li, &ldquo;Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR): The Internet Address Assignment and Aggregation Plan,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>) and the IPv4 address
	allocation architecture was defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC1518'>[RFC1518]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rekhter, Y. and T. Li, &ldquo;An Architecture for IP Address Allocation with CIDR,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1993.</span><span>)</span></a>.  A
	similar address allocation architecture was proposed for IPv6 in
	<a class='info' href='#RFC1887'>[RFC1887]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rekhter, Y. and T. Li, &ldquo;An Architecture for IPv6 Unicast Address Allocation,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1995.</span><span>)</span></a>.  The objective of this document is to
	update the previous documents and provide the best current guidance
	on an address allocation architecture to help manage the growth of
	routing tables in IPv6.
      
</p>
<p>
	The Internet has continued to evolve and the demands placed on its
	infrastructure continue to grow at an increasing rate. While there
	are a number of contributing factors, there are a few key elements
	that have led to a concerning escalation in routing table growth
	and have made scalability an area of serious concern for network
	operators.  Effort must be put forward to minimize the impact of
	IPv6 deployment to the routing subsystem. Two key aspects of this
	system include routing table churn composed of routing
	advertisements and withdrawals and the routing table size as
	measured by the number of entries in the DFZ, the Default-Free
	zone. While retaining current Internet practices, this document
	addresses the problem of routing table size by examining steps to
	minimize the impact of Multi-homing and Traffic Engineering, two
	widely implemented features that provide enhanced network
	resiliency and traffic path control.

Roberts, &ldquo;Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> is a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
	  between IETF and ICANN that delegates the technical work of
	  assignment and allocation of addresses to IANA (a function of
	  ICANN) on behalf of the IETF and IRTF (see sections 1 and 4.3).
	  The MoU directs IANA to comply with "the criteria and procedures
	  specified in RFCs, including Proposed, Draft, and full Internet
	  Standards and Best Current Practice documents" (section 4.1).
	
</p>
<p>
	  Technical disputes in this agreement are first directed to the
	  IESG, and if not resolved, arbitrated by the IAB (sections 4.1,
R	  4.2).
	
</p>
<p>
	  The document specifically stipulates that policy issues around IP
	  addressing are outside of the scope of the MoU (section 4.4).

<a name="rfc.section.2.3"></a><h3>2.3.&nbsp;
Technical issues vs. policy issues</h3>

<p>
	  The documents cited above make it clear that policy issues are
	  delegated from the IETF through ICANN and IANA to the RIRs.
	  The same documents make it equally clear that the IETF is still
	  responsible for technical matters and procedures.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The routing subsystem is a key component of the Internet.
	  Without routing, no packets are delivered.  The routing subsystem
	  consists of multiple routing protocols as well as the procedures
	  for utilizing these protocols to provide coherent and timely
	  routing services.  The procedures for deploying and operating the
	  routing subsystem are characterized in the routing architecture.
	  Specifying the routing architecture is a technical issue.
	
</p>
<p>
	  A key issue in the routing architecture is the scalability of the
	  architecture.  If the architecture fails to scale, then the
	  routing subsystem can fail, either in its basic functionality,
	  from a performance perspective, or from a cost perspective.  For
	  the routing architecture to scale, the amount of data propagated
	  within the routing subsystem must be limited, as the routing
	  subsystem must ultimately have a hardware instantiation, and
	  unlimited hardware simply does not exist.
	
</p>
<p>
	  As technology progresses over time, the intrinsic capabilities of
	  hardware improves.  There are multiple dimensions for
	  improvement, each with their own trend lines and projections.
	  Based on these trends, we can reasonably expect that hardware
	  scalability will improve over time, tracking these trends.  As a
	  result, for the routing architecture to scale, it must operate
	  within the growth rates of these trends.  Thus, ensuring that the
	  routing subsystem scales at no more than an appropriate rate of
	  growth is a technical issue.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The scalability of the routing subsystem is wholly dependent on
	  the addressing architecture for the network.  Routing views the
	  network as a graph composed of nodes and edges between those
	  nodes.  Carrying information about each node and edge of the
	  graph does not scale, so routing works by creating abstractions
	  of entire subgraphs.  The most productive abstractions happen
	  when the subgraph is closely topologically related, such as when
	  all of the nodes in the subgraph are interconnected by the edges
	  in the subgraph.  We can further create hierarchies of
	  abstractions to get further scalability.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Poorly chosen abstractions that do not align with the topology of
	  the network result in abstractions that do not reduce the data
	  burden on routing, as additional data is needed for path
	  computation.  Thus, the correct procedures for creating
	  abstractions in the topology are also a technical issue.
	
</p>
<p>
	  To manipulate data about the network in a convenient manner, we
	  give names to nodes in the network, where each name is an
	  address.  If names are assigned in a manner that is consistent
	  with the hierarchy of abstractions, then a single name can also
	  be used to represent a subgraph of the network, such as a single
	  site.  These types of names are known as prefixes or aggregates
	  and the overall procedure for assigning addresses to nodes and
	  aggregates to subgraphs is the addressing architecture for the
	  network.  Clearly, the correct application and operation of the
	  addressing architecture is central to the operation and ongoing
	  scalability of the routing architecture.
	
</p>
<p>
	  The operation of the addressing architecture involves both
	  technical issues and policy issues.  Procedures for determining
	  subgraph boundaries and subsequent prefix allocations are clearly
	  driven by the technical requirements of the architecture.  From a
	  technical perspective, the graph is composed of many different
	  types of nodes.  These include leaf nodes, multiply connected
	  nodes with a minimal number of edges, and densely connected
	  nodes.  Determining the current connectivity of a site is clearly
	  a technical issue.  Judging how that site might evolve in the
	  future and thus the role that the site should play in the
	  addressing architecture is a matter of policy.
	
</p>
<p>
	  These issues are simply examples.  There are likely to be many
	  more, some of which may be contentious.  Completely separating
	  the technical issues from the policy issues is decidedly
	  non-trivial and is most likely an inefficient exercise.  In
	  reality and for pragmatic purposes, it is necessary that all
	  issues be resolved in a consistent and compatible manner.  The
	  end goal is clearly shared: the successful operation of a
	  scalable routing and addressing architecture.
	
</p>
<p>
	  This document deals with the technical aspects of the addressing
	  architecture.

Contributing factors to the scalability problem</h3>

<p>
	There are several factors that work against routing table
	scalability.  A full description of the contributing factors and
	views can be read in
	<a class='info' href='#I-D.narten-radir-problem-statement'>[I&#8209;D.narten&#8209;radir&#8209;problem&#8209;statement]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T., &ldquo;On the Scalability of Internet Routing,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>. The exhaustion
	of the unassigned IPv4 address space is the principal motivator
	resulting in two of the key growth drivers. The first driver is the
	presence of increasingly longer prefixes in the DFZ.  Over the
	years the longest prefix generally accepted globally has increased
	from a relatively small number of classful prefixes to a
	preponderance of classless /24 CIDR prefixes. As IPv4 address
	availability diminishes, more Internet users are and will continue
	to push their providers to route even longer prefixes externally
	that in the past were filtered.  This is something that we must
	look to minimize and find ways to deter as much as possible for
	IPv6.
      
</p>
<p>
	The second driver resulting from IPv4 address exhaustion is the
	rapid uptake in IPv6 deployment by providers and end users. This
	adoption, while clearly in the best interest for the long term
	viability of the Internet, contributes a unique set of challenges
	that must be addressed to promote efficient routing table
	growth. Some of these challenges visible today are the liberal
	assignment of Provider Independent (PI) space to end users,
	micro-allocations, and critical network infrastructure allocations
	by the various RIRs.
      
</p>
<p>
	These drivers have increased the need for more guidance on the
	addressing architecture in order to limit the number of unnecessary
	entries in the global routing table. The future impact of this
	increased pressure on routing table growth is an area of immediate
	concern.

Aggregation</h3>

<p>
	The common method for reducing state on both internal and external
	routing tables is through aggregation of information.  Borrowing
	from experience gained in operating IPv4 networks, in order for
	aggregation to succeed in reducing the global routing system growth
	rate, the IPv6 address assignment process needs to make aggregation
	of routing information along topological lines.  In general, the
	topology of the network has not changed since IPv4 CIDR and even
	with IPv6 the topology of the network is still determined by the
	service providers who have built it.  Topologically significant
	address assignments are necessarily service-provider oriented.
      
</p>
<p>

	</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
	    The assignment of prefixes is intended to roughly follow the
	    underlying Internet topology so that aggregation can be used to
	    facilitate scaling of the global routing system.  One implication
	    of this strategy is that prefix assignment and aggregation is
	    generally done according to provider-subscriber relationships,
	    since that is how the Internet topology is determined.
	    [Section 3]
	  
</p>
<p>
	    Aggregation is simple for an end site that is connected to one
	    service provider: it uses address space assigned by its service
	    provider, and that address space is a small piece of a larger
	    block allocated to the service provider.  No explicit route is
	    needed for the end site; the service provider advertises a single
	    aggregate route for the larger block.  This advertisement
	    provides reachability and routeability for all the customers
	    numbered in the block.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    There are two, more complex, situations that reduce the
	    effectiveness of aggregation:
	    </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
		An organization that is multi-homed.  Because a multi-homed
		organization must be advertised into the system by each of
		its service providers, it is often not feasible to aggregate
		its routing information into the address space of any one of
		those providers.  Note that the organization still may
		receive its address assignment out of a service provider's
		address space (which has other advantages), but that a route
		to the organization's prefix is, in the most general case,
		explicitly advertised by all of its service providers.  For
		this reason, the global routing cost for a multi-homed
		organization is generally the same as it was prior to the
		adoption of CIDR.  A more detailed consideration of
		multi-homing practices can be found in
		<a class='info' href='#RFC4116'>[RFC4116]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Abley, J., Lindqvist, K., Davies, E., Black, B., and V. Gill, &ldquo;IPv4 Multihoming Practices and Limitations,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.
	      
</li>
<li>
		An organization that changes service provider but does not
		renumber.  This has the effect of "punching a hole" in one of
		the original service provider's aggregated route
		advertisements.  CIDR handles this situation by requiring
		that the newer service provider to advertise a specific
		advertisement for the re-homed organization; this
		advertisement is preferred over provider aggregates because
		it is a longer match.  To maintain efficiency of aggregation,
		it is recommended that an organization that changes service
		providers plan eventually to migrate its network into a
		prefix assigned from its new provider's address space.  To
		this end, it is recommended that mechanisms to facilitate
		such migration, such as dynamic host address assignment that
		uses <a class='info' href='#RFC2131'>[RFC2131]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Droms, R., &ldquo;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a>), be deployed wherever
		possible, and that additional protocol work be done to
		develop improved technology for renumbering.  [Section 4.1]

	    By allocating a contiguous power-of-two block address space to
	    the site (as opposed to multiple, independent prefixes), the
	    site's routing information may be aggregated into a single
	    prefix.  Also, since the routing cost associated with assigning
	    a multi-homed site out of a service provider's address space is
	    no greater than the old method of sequential number assignment
	    by a central authority, it makes sense to assign all end-site
	    address space out of blocks allocated to service providers.
	  
</p>
<p>
	    It is also worthwhile to mention that since aggregation may
	    occur at multiple levels in the system, it may still be
	    possible to aggregate these anomalous routes at higher levels
	    of whatever hierarchy may be present.  For example, if a site
	    is multi-homed to two relatively small providers that both
	    obtain connectivity and address space from the same large
	    provider, then aggregation by the large provider of routes from
	    the smaller networks will include all routes to the multi-homed
	    site.  The feasibility of this sort of second-level aggregation
	    depends on whether topological hierarchy exists among a site,
	    its directly-connected providers, and other providers to which
	    they are connected; it may be practical in some regions of the
	    global Internet but not in others.  [Section 4.1]

	There are several salient points that should be extracted
	from this table.  The first, and foremost, is that the
	routing table is now growing rapidly.  At 54% growth, this is
	faster than Moore's law would accommodate.  The roots are
	prefixes that have no 'less specifics' in the routing
	table. Even at 50% growth per year, this number exceeds
	Moore's law.  More specifics are typically injected to
	support traffic engineering or multi-homing.   
      
</p>
<p>
	The AS count growth shows the number of new organizations
	participating in BGP.  Transit ASes are routing domains that
	have multiple peer ASes.  Stub ASes are routing domains that
	have only a single peer AS.

<a name="rfc.section.6.1"></a><h3>6.1.&nbsp;
Analysis</h3>

<p>
	  These numbers show that 610 new organizations have joined IPv6
	  routing.  Of these new organizations, 85% are stub ASes.  The new
	  organizations are injecting 860 new prefixes.  Of these, 76% are
	  root prefixes.  Since any new AS must inject at least one prefix
	  into routing to be counted, there would appear to be a very high
	  correlation between new stub ASes and new root prefixes.  From
	  this, it seems reasonable to conclude that the bulk of the new
	  root prefixes are injected by stub ASes.  Further, since it seems
	  unlikely that most of these stub ASes will turn into transit ASes
	  in the future, it also seems reasonable to conclude that these
	  organizations are actually end-user organizations who are
	  injecting routes based on their PI address assignments.
	
</p>
<p>
	  Thus, the bulk of the routing table growth appears to be due to
	  PI prefix injection.

Projections</h3>

<p>
	  Given the high state of flux in the deployment of IPv6, it seems
	  difficult to conclude that the statistics from 2009 will be
	  representative of future routing table growth.  Thanks to the
	  influx of new users who are being forced onto IPv6 by the
	  impending IPv4 runout, there are plausible arguments that would
	  suggest that growth could accelerate.  There are also plausible
	  arguments that suggest that as IPv6 deployment reaches ubiquity,
	  that the growth might curtail in a logistic S-curve.  Lacking
	  more data, it is difficult to clearly argue that either of these
	  results is inevitable.
	
</p>
<p>
	  It is possible, however, to look at the implications of the
	  current growth rate, if it is sustained at the 2009 rate of 54%.
