Abstract 
    
   It is expected that future IP devices will have a variety of access 
   technologies to gain network connectivity. Currently there are 
   access-specific mechanisms for providing client information to the 
   network for authentication and authorization purposes. In addition 
   to being limited to specific access medias (e.g., 802.1x for IEEE 
   802 links), some of these protocols are also sub-optimal (e.g., PPP 
   due to its mandatory framing which is not always needed). The goal 
   of the PANA Working Group is to design a general network-layer 
   protocol to authenticate clients to the networks. The protocol will 
   run between a client's device and an agent device in the network 
   where the agent might be a client of the AAA infrastructure. The 
   protocol should be independent of the underlying access-type and not 
   overloaded with other aspects of the network access (e.g., framing). 
   This document defines the common terminology and identifies the 
   requirements for PANA.

 Internet Draft      PANA Requirements and Terminology        Feb 2002 
  
1. Introduction 
    
   Currently there are a variety of access technologies available to 
   the network clients. While most of the clients currently have single 
   interface, it is expected that in the future they will have multiple 
   interfaces of different types to access the network.  
    
   An authentication mechanism is needed in order to provide secure 
   network access to the legitimate clients. Some of the current 
   authentication mechanisms are access technology specific. For 
   example 802.1x [8021X] only works for IEEE 802 link layers. If a 
   client can have more than one type of interface, using access-
   specific authentication mechanisms leads to running a collection of 
   protocols on the client for the same purpose. It is clearly 
   advantageous to use a general protocol to authenticate the client 
   for network access on any type of technology. 
    
   The most widely used protocol for authenticating clients is the PPP 
   [PPP]. This protocol can run on various access types, but it is not 
   limited to authenticating the clients. It also provides mandatory 
   PPP framing. Since framing is already supported by certain link 
   types, having to use this extra framing creates sub-optimal network 
   access solutions. 
    
   There is currently no general protocol to be used by a client for 
   gaining network access, and the PANA Working Group will attempt to 
   fill that hole. The Working Group will design a protocol between a 
   client's device and an agent device in the network where the agent 
   might be a client of the AAA infrastructure. As a network-layer 
   protocol, it will be independent of the underlying access 
   technologies. The protocol design will also be limited to defining a 
   messaging protocol (i.e., a carrier) for providing the clients' 
   information to the network for authentication and authorization 
   purposes. It will not deal with the other aspects of network access 
   such as framing.  
    
   The Working Group will not invent new security protocols and 
   mechanisms but instead will use the existing mechanisms. In 
   particular, the Working Group will not define authentication 
   protocols, key distribution or key agreement protocols, or key 
   derivation. The desired protocol can be viewed as the front-end of 
   the AAA protocol or any other protocol/mechanisms the network is 
   running at the background to authenticate its clients. It will act 
   as a carrier for an already defined security protocol or mechanism. 
    
   As an example, Mobile IP Working Group has already defined such a 
   carrier for Mobile IPv4 [MIPV4]. Mobile IPv4 registration request 
   message is used as the carrier for authentication extensions (MN-FA 
   [MIPV4], or MN-AAA [MNAAA]) to receive forwarding service from the 
   foreign agents. In that sense, designing the equivalent of Mobile 
   IPv4 registration request messages for general network access is the

   goal of this work, but not defining the equivalent of MN-FA or MN-
   AAA extensions. 
    
   This document defines the common terminology and identifies the 
   requirements of a protocol for PANA. These terminology and 
   requirements will be used to define and limit the scope of the work 
   to be done in this group. 
    
 
2. Key Words 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS]. 
    
 
3. Terminology 
    
   Device Identifier (DI) 
    
         The identifier used by the network as a handle to control and  
         police the network access of a client. Depending on the access   
         technology, identifier might contain any of IP address, link- 
         layer address, switch port number, etc. of a device. PANA  
         authentication agent keeps a table for binding device  
         identifiers to the PANA clients. At most one PANA client  
         should be associated with a DI on a PANA authentication agent. 
    
   PANA Client (PaC) 
    
         The entity wishing to obtain network access from a PANA  
         authentication agent within a network. A PANA client is 
         associated with a network device and a set of credentials to  
         prove its identity within the scope of PANA.  
    
   PANA Authentication Agent (PAA) 
    
         The entity whose responsibility is to authenticate the 
         credentials provided by a PANA client and grant network  
         access service to the device associated with the client 
         and identified by a DI. 
 
    
4. Requirements 
    
4.1. Authentication 
    
  4.1.1. Authentication of Client 
    
   PANA MUST authenticate a PaC for network access. A PaC can be 
   identified by the credentials (identifier, authenticator) supplied 
   by one of the users of the device or the device itself. PANA MUST 
    
 Yegin (Editor), et.al.        Expires Aug 2002               [Page 4] 

 Internet Draft      PANA Requirements and Terminology        Feb 2002 
  
   only grant network access service to the device identified by the 
   DI, rather than granting separate access to multiple simultaneous 
   users of the device. Once the network access is granted to the 
   device, the methods used by the device on arbitrating which one of 
   its users can access the network is outside the scope of PANA. 
    
   PANA MUST NOT define new security protocols or mechanisms. Instead 
   it must be defined as a "carrier" for such protocols. PANA MUST 
   identify which specific security protocol(s) or mechanism(s) it can 
   carry (the "payload"). An example of a carrier would be the 
   registration request message of Mobile IPv4 [MIPV4] that carries MN-
   FA authentication extension.  
    
   Authentication and encryption of data traffic sent to and from an 
   authenticated PaC is outside the scope of PANA. Providing a complete 
   secure network access solution by also securing router discovery 
   [RDISC], neighbor discovery [NDISC], and address resolution 
   protocols [ARP] is outside the scope as well. 
    
    
  4.1.2. Authorization, Accounting and Access Control 
 
   In addition to carrying authentication information, PANA MUST also 
   carry a binary result (i.e., success or failure) of authorization 
   for network access to the PaC. Providing finer granularity 
   authorization is outside the scope of PANA. 
    
   Providing access control functionality in the network is outside the 
   scope of PANA. PAA MAY communicate the DI associated with a PaC to 
   other entities in the network to setup packet filters and access 
   control state. This interaction is outside the scope of PANA as 
   well. 
    
   Carrying accounting data is outside the scope of PANA. 
    
    
  4.1.3. Authentication Backend 
    
   PAA MAY use either a AAA backend, some other mechanism or a local 
   database to authenticate the PaC. PANA protocol MUST NOT make any 
   assumptions on the backend authentication protocol or mechanisms. 
   The interaction between the PAA and the backend authentication 
   entities is outside the scope of PANA. 
    
    
  4.1.4. Re-authentication 
    
   PANA MUST be capable of carrying out both periodic and on-demand re-
   authentication. Both the PaC and the PAA MUST be able to initiate 
   both the initial authentication and the re-authentication process.

 Internet Draft      PANA Requirements and Terminology        Feb 2002 
  
  4.1.5. Mutual Authentication 
    
   Both the PaC and the PAA MUST be able to authenticate each other for 
   network access. Providing capability of only PAA authenticating the 
   PaC is not sufficient. 
    
    
  4.1.6. Identifiers 
    
   PANA SHOULD allow various types of identifiers to be used for the 
   PaC (e.g., NAI, IP address, FQDN, etc.) 
    
   PANA SHOULD allow various types of identifiers to be used as the DI 
   (IP address, link-layer address, port number of a switch, etc.)  
    
   PAA MUST be able to create a binding between the PaC and the 
   associated DI upon successful PANA exchange. This binding is used
   for access control and accounting in the network as described 
   in section 4.1.2.

        
4.2. Network 
    
  4.2.1. Multi-access 
    
   Protocol MUST support PaCs with multiple interfaces, and networks 
   with multiple routers on multi-access links. 
    
    
  4.2.2. Disconnect Indication 
    
   PANA MUST NOT assume connection-oriented links. Links may or may not 
   provide disconnect indication. PANA SHOULD define a "disconnect" 
   indication to allow PaCs to notify the PAA of their departure from 
   the network. A similar indication SHOULD also be used to let PAA 
   notify a PaC about the discontinuation of the network access. Access 
   discontinuation can happen due to various reasons such as network 
   systems going down, or a change in access policy. 
    
    
  4.2.3. Location of PAA 
    
   PAA MAY be one or more hop away from the PaC. 
    
    
4.3. Interaction with Other Protocols 
    
   PANA MUST NOT handle mobility management of the PaC. But, it MUST be 
   able to co-exist and not interfere with various mobility management 
   protocols, such as Mobile IPv4 [MIPV4], Mobile IPv6 [MIPV6], fast 
   handover protocols [FMIPV4, FMIPV6], and other standard protocols 
   like IPv6 stateless address auto-configuration [ADDRCONF] (including

   privacy extensions [PRIVACY]), and DHCP [DHCP]. It MUST NOT make any 
   assumptions on the protocols or mechanisms used for IP address 
   configuration of the PaC.  
    
    
4.4. Performance 
    
   PANA design SHOULD give consideration to efficient handling of 
   authentication process. This is important for gaining network access 
   with minimum latency. As an example, a method like minimizing the 
   protocol signaling by creating local security associations can be 
   used for this purpose. 
    
 
4.5. Miscellaneous 
    
  4.5.1. IP Version Independence 
    
   PANA MUST work for both IPv4 and IPv6. 
    
    
  4.5.2. Reliability and Congestion 
    
   PANA MUST provide reliability and congestion control. It can do so 
   by using techniques like re-transmissions, cyclic redundancy check, 
   delayed initialization and exponential back-off. 
 
 
  4.5.3. Denial of Service Attacks 
   
   PANA MUST be robust against a class of DoS attacks such as blind 
   masquerade attacks through IP spoofing that swamp the PAA in 
   spending much resources and prevent legitimate clients∆ attempts of 
   network access. The required robustness is no worse than that for 
   TCP SYN attack.
