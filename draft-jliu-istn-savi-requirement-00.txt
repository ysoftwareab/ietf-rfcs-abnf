1.  Introduction

   Mega-constellations of low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites, such as
   Starlink [Starlink], Kuiper [Kuiper] and OneWeb [OneWeb] serve the
   area that the terrestrial networks cannot reach
   [Networking-in-Heaven].  LEO satellites have advantage of wide
   coverage [ITU-6G][Surrey-6G][Nttdocomo-6G] and low delay
   [Low-Latency-in-Space].

   LEO mega-constellations have Inter Satellite Links (ISLs) ,which
   enable traditional attacks extend from one-hop in satellite
   communication environment to the whole satellite networks.  Also,
   LEO's attributes, such as open access environment, limited Resources
   and dynamic topology, enable severe security threats.  These security
   threats yield diverse challenges on existing network security design.

   By analyzing security events occurred recently, we realized that
   typical LEO threats are Source Address Spoofing.  This memo outlines
   the major problems and requirements for improvement on source address
   validation mechanism in ISTN.

3.  Vulnerable Characteristics of ISTN

   A satellite constellation is composed of one or more satellite
   shells.  Each shell is organized by a large number of satellites
   distributed around the earth according to certain design strategies
   to ensure cooperative performance.  Kepler elements can be used to
   describe the orbit of a satellite.  Usually, satellites with an
   orbital altitude of 400-2000 km are called LEO satellites, and
   satellites with an orbital altitude of 2000-36000 km are MEO
   satellites.  GEO is a satellite in geosynchronous orbit, with an

   altitude of about 36000 km from the earth.  Satellites in different
   orbits have their own characteristics [LEO-MEO-GEO].  Table 1

3.1.  Inter-Satellite Links (ISLs)

   Comparing with previous satellite communication systems,ene of the
   most obvious feature of the mega constellation is the use of inter-
   satellite links.  ISL can reduce the delay of satellite network and
   improve network capacity by avoiding the ping-pong phenomenon and
   reducing the occupation of the link between the ground station (GS)
   and the satellite.  Although ISL is not used in the initial stage of
   Starlink deployment, it is still an important part of the future
   satellite network.  The first launche of 51 Starlink Block v1.5
   satellites took place in September 2021 [STARLINK-ISL].  The
   performance of trans-oceanic routes in networks with and without ISL
   is discussed in [Ground-Relays].  The conclusion is that ISL always
   have lower delay than ground relay.  The most typical configuration
   is to equip each satellite with four ISLs, which are respectively
   used to link the front and rear satellites in the same orbit and the
   two satellites in adjacent orbits [Internetworking].  In fact, ISL

Internet-Draft     ISTN SAVI Problems and Requirements      October 2021


   does not need to be restricted by grid topology.  It has become a new
   problem to design ISL configuration to maximize network bandwidth and
   minimize latency [Motif].

3.2.  Open Access Environment

   As transmission medium used by satellites, wireless microwave or
   laser channel, has inferior transmission quality comparing to wired
   channel.  Moreover, the communication between satellites and GSs will
   be affected by weather, atmospheric conditions, signal attenuation.
   The transmission channel can be disturbed easily due to the open
   environment.  In addition, the position description information, such
   as orbit of the satellite, is public.  Therefore the motion can be
   accurately predicted through calculation [GPS-Precision].  This will
   increase the possibility of premeditated attack.  Moreover, due to
   the global movement of the satellite, the majority of its cycle is in
   an uncontrolled environment, facing a large number of malicious hosts
   and users distributed all over the world.

3.3.  Dynamic Networks

   Due to the extremely fast speed of LEO satellites relative to the
   ground, it has short-lived coverage for terrestrial users (less than
   3 minutes).  What's more, under the minmax connection principle, a
   handover occurs in an average of about 40 seconds
   [In-Orbit-Computing].  The frequent handover between user terminals
   and LEO satellites will cause inevitable frequent updating of the IP
   address.

3.4.  Limited Resources

   Due to the limitation of rocket capacity, cost and manufacturing
   technology, satellite design will be subject to many restrictions.
   The processors on satellites also have worse performance than that of
   the terrestrial equipment.  Up-to-date onboard processor have a CPU
   frequency ranging from 100MHz to 500MHz, much lower than commercial
   processors.

   In particular, typical performance of spatial processor are as
   follows.  The Cobham GR740 [GR740] is a 65 nm CPU with a 32-bit quad-
   core architecture that operates at 250 MHz with estimated power
   dissipation of under 1.5 W.  The BAE Systems RAD5545 [RAD5545] is a
   45 nm CPU with a 64-bit quad-core architecture that operates at 466
   MHz with estimated power dissipation of under 20 W.  The Boeing
   Maestro [Maestro] is a 90 nm CPU with a 64-bit 49-core architecture
   that operates at 350 MHz with estimated power dissipation of under
   22.2 W.  A space-grade 32 nm CPU HPSC [HPSC] with 64-bit dual quad-
   core architecture is considered that is currently being developed by
   Boeing, which is estimated to operate at 500 MHz with power
   dissipation of under 10 W.

3.5.  Threat from Source Address Spoofing

   The report [GLOBAL-DDoS] shows that attacks occur increasingly in
   satellite systems.  In 2019, attacks on satellite systems increased
   255 percent.  Some hackers begun to attack the satellite
   constellations, rather than the previous ones on satellite monomers.
   DDoS attacks against satellite networks have feature of low-cost and
   low-detectability.  And by congesting of the target link, or
   exploiting some vulnerable characteristics, the satellite networks
   are as vulnerable to DDoS attacks as terrestrial networks [ICARUS].

   In the past, the attacks on satellite communication systems, such as
   eavesdropping, interference and frequency blocking mainly occur in
   the physical layer.  The use of the ISL in ISTN increases the
   vulnerability of network layer and above.  DDoS attack [DDoS-Attack]
   is one of the most common attack in network layer.  Cisco predicts
   that the number of DDoS attacks will increase to 154 million
   worldwide in 2023 [Cisco-Report].  Through the query and test of DNS
   services in 62000 autonomous domains around the world, it is found
   that more than half of the networks are in danger of being DDoS
   attacked because they do not validate the source address of packets
   [Dns-Security].

   Due to limited computing resource, lack of traceability, and exposure
   to the uncontrolled environment, source address spoofing attacks in
   ISTN are more severe than that in the terrestrial network.  To
   prevent this kind of attack, the most effective mechanism in
   terrestrial network is to filter the address spoofing packet and
   ensure the traceability of the packet through source address to
   locate the malicious users in the network
   [RFC5210][RFC7039][RFC7513][RFC8074].

Internet-Draft     ISTN SAVI Problems and Requirements      October 2021


   In the terrestrial network, source address validation mechanisms such
   as SAVI have been deployed and proved effective to a certain extent.
   However, due to the vulnerable characteristics of satellite
   constellations described in 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, SAVI mechanism cannot
   be used directly in ISTN.

4.  Problems of Source Address Spoofing in ISTN

4.1.  Understand The Necessity of Onboard Source Address Validation

   The most effective deployment scheme of SAVI is to deploy on the
   first hop switching device.  In the traditional satellite
   communication system, the satellite adopts "bent-pipe-only" model,
   that is, satellites only relay terrestrial users' radio signals to
   the fixed ground stations without ISLs or routing.  As ground station
   location is fixed, the storage location of anchor binding information
   is fixed accordingly.  Therefore, the SAVI mechanism can take effect
   stably at a low cost in terrestrial networks.

   ISTN is in a dilemma of vast global traffic and limited ground
   stations.  If the "bent-pipe-only" model is adopted, all traffic on
   the network will converge to the thimbleful of ground stations.  This
   will generate traffic convergence, resulting in bottlenecks and a
   sharp decline in network performance.  That explains why ISLs are put
   on the Starlink agenda and routers are the most expected device in
   the network infrastructure.  Further, in such a network structure,
   the source address validation mechanisms are naturally deployed on
   satellites.

   The source address validation scenario for mega constellations is
   shown in Figure 1.  It is divided into ground segment and satellite
   segment.  The ground segment includes user terminal, authentication
   server and ground gateway, and is connected to the Internet through
   ground gateway.  The space segment consists of satellites in the
   satellite Internet (support SAVI and ISL).

         Figure 1: The source address validation scenario for ISTN.

   However, in today's time-varying topology LEO satellite networks,
   SAVI mechanism faces the problem that the anchor binding information
   stored on the satellite is no longer stable.  The router in
   satellites moves at a high speed, therefore the mobility mechanism in
   the terrestrial network is no longer effective.  There are two
   possible terms of settlement as follows.  Each has its respective
   unacceptable weaknesses.

4.2.  Signaling Storm and Service Interruption

   Reauthentication in ISTN contains the following steps according to
   its network composition:

   1.  Considering the resource limitation and information security of
   satellites, the authentication server (such as RADIUS Server) storing
   user identity information needs to be accessed after reaching the GS
   through the ISL,

   2.  The LEO satellite initially accessed by the user terminal acts as
   an authenticator to initiate an identity authentication request to
   the authentication server and assign an address to the user terminal,

   3.  As LEO satellites keep moving at a high-speed relative to ground,
   user terminals need to switch access to satellites every dozens of
   seconds,

   4.  After the handover, the user needs to find a new satellite as the
   access point and perform the reauthentication and rebinding process
   to access the network.

   A.  Signaling Storm

   First, the user sends the authentication request to the NCC on the
   ground through the network for reauthentication process.  This
   process requires multiple signaling interactions between the user and
   the access satellite, between the access satellite and the NCC.
   Secondly, the authenticated user executes the address configuration
   process to obtain the trusted address.  In this process, multiple
   signaling interactions with specific servers or satellites will also
   occur according to the address configuration mechanism.  From the
   perspective of the whole network, a large amount of users need to
   perform reauthentication at every moment, and each reauthentication
   contains a large amount of signaling.  Therefore, as shown in
   Figure 2, if the number of users rises to 97000 under the scale of
   Starlink phase I, signaling storm occurs, which not only occupies the
   link bandwidth, but also generates the bottlenecks of NCC and cause
   bad deterioration of network performance.

   B.  Service Interruption

   The legitimacy of user identity and the authenticity of address are
   the premise of realizing the function of upper layer protocol.
   During the period from the handover to the successful rebinding, the
   user cannot use the services at the network layer or above.  This
   will cause interruption of the user's ongoing business.  Users need
   to wait until the completion of the reauthentication process.  This
   seriously affects user experience.

4.3.  Delay Deterioration and Bandwidth Occupation

   Tunnel forwarding in ISTN contains the following steps according to
   its network composition:

   1.  After disconnecting from the access satellite, the user forwards
   the data traffic to the satellite where the anchor binding
   information is located through the tunnel instead of reauthenticate
   or rebind,

   2.  After receiving the data packet, the satellite with anchor
   binding information unpacks it to obtain the user's original data
   packet, and then validates its source address.

   A.  Delay Deterioration

   Since source address validation is required before the packet is
   forwarded, it needs to be forwarded to the satellite where the anchor
   binding information is located, and then routed after validation.
   This causes traffic detour and additional delay.  Moreover, due to
   the periodicity of satellite movement, after disconnecting from the
   user, the satellite will gradually move away from the user in half a
   cycle, and even on the other side of the earth in the worst case.  It
   can be seen from Figure 3 and Figure 4 that the number of hops and
   time delay from the user are gradually increasing in the first half
   of the satellite cycle as the satellite brings the anchor binding
   information moves away.

                Figure 4: The delay from anchor to the user.

   The introduction of such a large additional delay has completely
   suppressed the low delay advantage of mega constellations.

   B.  Capacity Deterioration

   From the end-to-end perspective, the detour of data traffic causes
   delay.  From the network perspective, the detour of data traffic
   causes additional ISLs to be used.  Compared with the shortest path,
   tunnel forwarding needs to pass through more ISLs when delivering the
   same amount of end-to-end traffic, therefore occupying more
   bandwidth.  The reduction of ISL bandwidth leads to the decline of
   the overall network capacity.

5.  Requirements for Improvement on Source Address Validation for ISTN

   In order to implement source address validation mechanism in ISTN,
   the following requirements for improvement should be made:

Internet-Draft     ISTN SAVI Problems and Requirements      October 2021


5.1.  Scalability

   A reasonable source address validation mechanism should be able to
   deploy as many satellites and user nodes as possible in ISTN.  With
   the continuous development of constellation and user scale, network
   performance indicators such as delay and bandwidth should be
   discussed.  The focus is that there should be no bottleneck node for
   traffic aggregation in source address validation.

5.2.  Lightweight

   Due to on-board resources are very limited, source address validation
   mechanism should be lightweight.  At present, more and more Internet
   services, such as Content Delivery Network (CDN) [CDN-ISTN], are
   expected to be extended to satellites.  As a basic security function,
   source address validation mechanism should occupy less satellite
   resource and leave more computing power and memory capacity for upper
   layer services.

5.3.  Capacity

   The deployment of ISTN is a long-term activity with continuous launch
   and incremental deployment.  The design of source address validation
   mechanism should ensure that its functional integrity is not limited
   by the current completion degree of the constellation, and the
   mechanism should be considered as an indispensable part of load on
   the satellite design stage before launch.

5.4.  User Experience

   There should be an attribute that ensures the user to be unaware of
   the underlying physical handover.  The continuous Internet services
   on upper layers, such as video, conference and game services, should
   be able to maintain business continuity as well as low latency and
   high bandwidth provided by ISTN.
