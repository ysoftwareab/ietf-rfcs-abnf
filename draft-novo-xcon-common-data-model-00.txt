Internet-Draft          Common Conference Schema          September 2005


1.  Introduction

   This document defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema that
   represents the common conference information in a conferencing
   server.  The information is modeled as a series of elements, each of
   which contains children and attributes.

   The common conference information is a part of the Conference Object.
   The Conference Object contains two sections: the "Common Conference
   Information" section and the "Conference Template" section.  The
   common conference information section contains the XML schema, which
   is used to represent the core information that is utilized in any
   conference (capabilities, membership, roles, call control signalling,
   media, etc...) and specifies the set of rights, permissions and
   limitations pertaining to operations being performed on a certain
   Conference Object.

   This document gives an overview of the conference variables that have
   been introduced in various protocol drafts of the XCON working group
   to date and proposes to create a unified common conference
   information data model for XCON.

   [Editors Note: This document is still in early stages of development
   and is intended to trigger discussions.  It is not intended to
   provide a complete schema description at this stage, but rather
   explore a potential schema to accommodate the proposals made so far.]

   This document has been constructed in compliance with the XCON
   Framework [1] and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package
   for Conference State [5].  It also incorporates data elements
   proposed in several XCON WG and SIPPING WG drafts.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].

   This document uses the terminology defined in the XCON Conferencing
   Framework [1] and the SIPPING Conferencing Framework [3].  In
   addition, it uses definitions from The Binary Floor Control Protocol
   [6].


3.  Common Conference Data

Internet-Draft          Common Conference Schema          September 2005


3.1.  General

   The conference object data model document is an XML [4] document that
   MUST be well formed and SHOULD be valid.  Conference object data
   model documents MUST be based on XML 1.0 and SHOULD be encoded using
   UTF-8.

   A Common Conference information document begins with the root element
   tag <conference-info> of conference-type.  The <conference-info> has
   the attribute 'entity' that contains the conference URI that
   identifies the conference being described in the document.  The
   <conference-info> element has the <version> element.  This attribute
   is explained in section 5 of this draft.

   The <conference-info> element is comprised of <conference-
   description>, <host-info>, <conference-state>, <security-mechanism>,
   <Floor Information>, <users>, <sidebars-by-ref> and <sidebars-by-val>
   child elements.  A common conference document must at least include
   the <conference-description>, <host-info>, <conference-state> and
   <users> child elements.  Some of this information can be represented
   using the conference-info-type schema as defined in [5].

   Changes in the state of the conference should be communicated to the
   subscribers using a conference package subscribers (ex.  A Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Conference State).
   Critical changes should be communicated to specific subscribers,
   perhaps those with unique roles.

   The following non-normative diagram gives an example of the overall
   hierarchy used in this format.  The operator "!" preceding an element
   indicates that this element is MANDATORY in the data model.  The
   operator "*" preceding an element indicates that this element is
   introduced/proposed in this draft.

   The following sections describe these elements in detail.  The full
   XML schema is provided in Section 4.

3.2.  <conference-description>

   The <conference-description> element describes the conference in its
   entirely.  It SHOULD have an extra attribute 'xml:lang' to specify
   the language used in the contents of this element as defined Section
   2.12 of [4].  It is comprised of <display-text>, <subject>, <free-
   text>, <keywords>, <web-page>, <security-level>, <allow-sidebars>,
   <conference-time>, <conf-uris>, <service-uris>, <maximum-user-count>,
   and <available-media>.

   The child elements <display-text>, <subject>, <free-text> and
   <keywords> are used to describe the conference content.  These
   elements are defined in [5].

   The child element <web-page> is an optional element that points to a
   URI with additional information about the conference.  These elements
   are described in [7].  The child elements <security-level> and
   <allow-sidebars> describe the capabilities of the conference.  These
   elements are described in [7].

   The <conference-time> child element has information related to
   conference time and duration of the conference.  The <conf-uris> and
   <service-uris> are used to describe the conference-related URIs.  The
   <maximum-user-count> child element indicates the number of users that
   can be invited to the conference.  The <available-media> child
   element is used to describe the media characteristics of the

   conference.

   The following sections describe the remaining elements in more
   detail.  Other child elements can be used to extend <conference-
   description> in the future.

3.2.1.  <conference-time>

   The <conference-time> element contains the information related to
   conference time and duration of a conference.  The <conference-time>
   element contains one or more <entry> elements each defining the time
   information of a single conference occurrence.

   Every <entry> element contains a <mixing-start-time>, <mixing-stop-
   time>, <can-join-after>, <must-join-before>, and <request-user>.
   These elements are explained in section 4.3.3 of [7].

   The <entry> element also contains the <recurrence> child element.
   This element MAY be used if a conference is scheduled or active at
   multiple time.  It is envisioned that this element be populated by
   ical.

3.2.2.  <conf-uris>

   The <conf-uris> contains the URI to be used in order to access the
   conference by different signaling means.  It contains a sequence of
   <entry> child elements, each containing <uri>, <display-text>, and
   <purpose>.  These elements are described in [5].

3.2.3.  <service-uris>

   The <service-uris> describes auxiliary services available for the
   conference.  It contains a sequence of <entry> child elements, each
   containing <uri>, <display-text>, and <purpose>.  These elements are
   described in [5].

3.2.4.  <maximum-user-count>

   The <maximum-user-count> contains the overall number of users allowed
   to join the conference.  It contains a sequence of <entry> child
   elements.  An <entry> element MAY contain the <count> sub-element
   that provides the number of users with a specific role allowed to
   join the conference.

3.2.5.  <available-media>

   The <available-media> has the 'label' attribute that is the media
   stream identifier assigned by the conferencing server.  This element

Internet-Draft          Common Conference Schema          September 2005


   contains a sequence of <entry> child elements of conference-medium-
   type.  Each <entry> element contains the <type>, <display-text>,
   <status>, and <codecs> child elements.  The attribute 'label' and the
   <type>, <display-text>, and <status> elements are described in [5].
   The <codecs> element has a child element as explain in section 7.1.1
   of [8].

3.3.  <host-info>

   The <host-info> element contains information about the entity hosting
   the conference.  It contains the <display-text>, <web-page>, and
   <uris> child elements.  These child elements are explained in [5].

3.4.  <conference-state>

   The <conference-state> element and the <user-count>, <active>, and
   <locked> child element are explained in section 5.5 of [5].  The
   <allow-conference-state> is described in section 4.3.7.2 of [7].

3.5.  <security-mechanism>

   The <security-mechanism> element has a single mandatory attribute,
   'name'.  The 'name' attribute identifies a protocol the policy of
   each protocol element is referring to.  It contains a series of
   <entry-protocol> sub-elements.  Each <entry-protocol> sub-element
   contains the policy related to the usage of a particular protocol.

   [Editors Note: The <security-mechanism> element only has defined the
   feature for the SIP protocol.  Discussion about other protocols
   (PSTN, HTML, Jabber, H.323, etc...) are in the XCON WG mailing list.]

   The <entry-protocol> element has a series of child elements: methods,
   option-tags, feature-tags, and bodies.  These elements are described
   in sections 6.1, 6.2,6.3, and 6.4 of [8].

3.6.  <floor-information>

   The <floor-information> element has the <allow-floor-events>, <floor-
   request-handling>, and the <conference-floor-policy> child elements.
   Other elements from different namespaces MAY be present for the
   purposes of extensibility.  The <conference-floor-policy> element,
   its attributes, and the <conference-floor-policy> child element are
   described in Section 18.8 of [9].  The <allow-floor-events>, and
   <floor-request-handling> are described in section 4.3.7.2 of [7].
   This draft extends the <conference-floor-policy> element with a new
   attribute 'label'.  The 'label' attribute identifies the media that
   the floor is controlling.

3.7.  <users>

   The <users> element contains the <join-handling>, <dial-out-list>,
   <refer-list>, <privileges-control-list> and <user> child elements.
   The <join-handling> element is described in section 4.3.7.2 of [7].

   The following sections describe the remaining elements in more
   detail.  Other child elements can be used to extend <conference-
   description> in the future.

3.7.1.  <dial-out-list>

   The <dial-out-list> child element contains a list of user URIs, a
   role, or domain (*@example.com) that the focus uses to determine who
   to invite to join a conference.  The <dial-out-list> element includes
   zero or more <target> child element and zero or more <external> child
   element.  Those two child elements includes the mandatory 'uri'
   attribute.  The use of the <external> and <target> elements are
   described in section 4.3.4 of [7].

3.7.2.  <refer-list>

   The <refer-list> child element contains a list of resources that the
   focus needs to refer to the conference.  The <refer-list> is
   identical to the <dial-out-list> element and is described in section
   4.3.5 of [7].

3.7.3.  <privileges-control-list>

   The <privileges-control-list> refers to a virtual set of rights,
   permissions and limitations pertaining to operations.  This element
   contains the <data-access-rights> and the <conference-rules>.

3.7.3.1.  <data-access-rights>

   The <data-access-rights> element describes the read/write access
   privileges for accessing the Conference Object as a whole.  It is
   partially described in [1].  The <data-access-rights> contains a list
   of elements defined in the Conference Object.  Every element has two
   attributes: the attribute 'read-only' and the attribute 'read-write'.
   When the conferencing server receives a request for access to
   privacy-sensitive data it needs to match it against the 'read-only'
   and the 'read-write' attributes.  Each attribute of each individual
   element is evaluated and as a result it is determined if the user can
   access that element.  The attributes specify the minimum subscriber's
   role that can access or modify the element of the conference.
   Subscribers with a lower role cannot access or modify the element.
   If an element is not defined in the <data-access-rights> then the

Internet-Draft          Common Conference Schema          September 2005


   'read-only' attribute MUST be interpreted as a "participant" and the
   'read-write' attribute MUST be interpreted as an "administrator" by
   default.  It is possible to defined only one of the attributes of the
   element, the other attribute SHOULD be interpreted by default.  This
   draft does not define the set of possible conferencing roles.

   However, it can also be the case that conflicts can occur given a
   hierarchy of elements.  In that case, the lower-level element
   privileges predominate over the upper-level privileges element.

3.7.3.2.  <conference-rules>

   The <conference-rules> element is a set of <entry> child elements
   with specific authorization rules that indicate who is allowed to
   subscribe to conference-information notifications, see floors,
   request/grant floors, and so on.  It is partially described in [7]

   Every <entry> element is represent by the 'id' attribute, each of
   which identifies a rule inside the conference.  It contains the
   <condition> and <actions> sub elements.

3.7.3.2.1.  <condition>

   The <condition> element determines whether a particular privilege
   applies to a user, a role, or domain.

   The <condition> element has the <identity> and the <validity> child
   element.  These elements MUST NOT appear more than once in the
   condition part of a single rule.

   The <identity> element is already defined in Section 7.1 of [10].
   This draft explains the <id>, <domain>, <any-identity> and <except>
   child elements of the <identity> element and gives some examples.
   The absence of the <identity> element in a <condition> element
   indicates that the privilege applies to all unauthenticated
   identities.

   Other child elements of the <identity> element defined in [7] are the
   <external-list> (Section 4.3.7.1.4.2), <pseudonymous> (Section
   4.3.7.1.5), <has-been-referred> (Section 4.3.7.1.6), <has-been-
   invited> (Section 4.3.7.1.7), <has-been-in-conference> (Section
   4.3.7.1.8), <is-in-conference> (Section 4.3.7.1.9), <key-participant>
   (Section 4.3.7.1.10), <is-on-dialout-list> (Section 4.3.7.1.11), <is-
   on-refer-list> (Section 4.3.7.1.12), <floor-id> (Section 4.3.7.1.13),
   <participant-passcode> (Section 4.3.7.1.14), and <key-participant-
   passcode> (Section 4.3.7.1.15) child elements.

   The <validity> element expresses the validity period of the rule with

   a starting and a ending time.  The <validity> element and its child
   elements ,<from> and <until>, are defined in section 7.3 of [10].

3.7.3.2.2.  <actions>

   The <actions> element in the applied rule is a positive grant of
   permission to the conference data model or the conferencing system.
   The <actions> element has the following operations defined in [7]:

   <allow-refer-users-dynamically> defined in section 4.3.7.2.4, <allow-
   invite-users-dynamically> defined in section 4.3.7.2.5, <allow-
   remove-users-dynamically> defined in section 4.3.7.2.6, <show-floor-
   holder> defined in section 4.3.7.3.4, <show-floor-requests> defined
   in section 4.3.7.3.5, <provide-anonymity> defined in section
   4.3.7.3.6,

   There are defined the following operations as well in this document:

   <read-write>

   The <read-write> element represents a boolean action.  If set to
   TRUE, the identity is allowed to modify the element described inside
   the 'element' attribute in the conference policy.  If set to FALSE,
   any modifications to the element are rejected.

   <read-only>

   The <read-only> element represents a boolean action.  If set to TRUE,
   the identity is allowed to read the element described inside the
   'element' attribute in the conference policy.  If set to FALSE, any
   attempts to read the element are rejected.

3.7.4.  <user>

   The element <user> describes a single participant in the conference.

   The following elements as well as the attributes of <user> are
   defined in [5], section 5.6: <display-text>, <associated-aors>,
   <roles>, <languages>, <cascaded-focus>, <endpoint>, <display-text>,
   <referred>, <status>, <joining-method>, <joining-info>,
   <disconnection-method>, <disconnection-info>, <media>, <label>,
   <src-id>, <call-info>, <display-text>, <call-id>, <to-tag>, <from-
   tag>.

   Note that the <media> child element of the <endpoint> does not have
   the child elements <display-text> and <type> as is defined in [5].
   This elements are not included in <media> because they are already
   defined in the <available-media> element.

   The <provide-anonymity> is a child element of <roles> and provides
   anonymity to a specific identity.  It is defined in 4.3.7.3.6 of [7].
   When a user is defined then the role must be defined or set to
   "participant" by default.  This specification does not define the set
   of possible conferencing roles nor the semantics associated with
   each.

   The <authorization-mechanism> element defines how the participants
   should be authenticated.  It can also be set to none.  The password
   associated with each user in the Digest authentication is included in
   the optional 'Password' attribute.  This attribute is ignored if
   authentication is set to "none".  This element is defined in [9].
   The <sphere> element can be used to indicate the state (e.g., 'work',
   'home', 'meeting', 'travel') the user is currently in.  It is defined
   in section 7.2 of [10].

   The <allow-refer-users-dynamically>, <allow-invite-users-dynamically>
   and <allow-remove-users-dynamically> elements are defined in section
   4.3.7.2 of [7].

   The <floors> element is a container of <entry> child elements, each
   describing a floor that joins this participant in the conference.
   The <entry> element has the <show-floor-holder> and the <show-floor-
   requests> child element.  They are described in section 4.3.7.3 of
   [7].  The <entry> child elements is represent by the 'id' attribute,
   each of which identifies a floor inside the conference.

   [Editors Note: The <call-info> element only has defined the <sip>
   child element.  Discussion about other sub elements (PSTN, HTML,
   Jabber, H.323, etc...) in the XCON WG mailing list.]

3.8.  <sidebars-by-ref>

   The <sidebars-by-ref> element contains a set of <entry> child
   elements.  Each <entry> child element contains a <user> child element
   with a sidebar conference URI and a <display-text> child element.
   The <sidebars-by-ref> element is described in Section 5.9.1 of [5].

   Notice that the <sidebars-by-ref> child element does not include the
   attribute 'state' defined in [5].

3.9.  <sidebars-by-val>

   The <sidebars-by-val> element contains a set of <entry> child
   elements each containing information about a single sidebar.  Each
   <entry> has the OPTIONAL <conference-time> child element and the
   <users> child elements.  The <conference-time> child element has
   information related to conference time and duration of the

   conference.  The <conference-time> child element SHOULD fall within
   the timeframe of the conference.  This element is explained in the
   section 3.2.1 of this draft.  Notice the <recurrence> element is not
   defined in the <conference-time> child elements of the <sidebars-by-
   val> element.

   Notice as well that the <sidebars-by-val> and the <entry> child
   element do not include the attribute 'state' defined in [5].

   The <users> child element contains a set of <user> elements each
   containing a sidebar conference URI.  The <sidebars-by-val> element
   is described in Section 5.9.2 of [5].


4.  XML Schema

   In accordance with the XCON framework document [1], the Conference
   Object is a logical representation of a conference instance.  It is
   separated into two XML schemas, the common conference information
   schema and the conference template schema.  The common conference
   information schema, called common-conference-schema.xsd contains core
   information that is utilized in any conference.  The conference
   template schema contains the variable information part of the
   Conference Object.  The document [11] supplies a set of core media
   templates that SHOULD be used in conjunction with this data model.
   In this draft we have only defined the common-conference-schema.xsd.

   [Editors Note: Authors are working on this and will release a new
   revision of this draft with the full schema in the near future]


5.  XML Schema Extensibility

   The Common Conference Information Data Model defined in this document
   is meant to be extensible toward specific application domains.  Such
   an extension is accomplished by defining elements, child elements and
   attributes that are specific to the desired application domain.  Each
   extension MUST define its own namespace.  Points of extension MUST be
   defined in the schema, and SHOULD be done using the <any
   namespace="##other"> construct.

   A versioning procedure for this schema is provided.  The <version>
   element MUST be included in the root <conference-info> element.  The
   complete conference information, elements and attributes, are
   associated with this version number.  If new elements or attributes
   are associated to the data model, the data model will have a higher
   version number according with the new elements defined.

Internet-Draft          Common Conference Schema          September 2005


   Elements or attributes from unknown namespaces MUST be ignored.

   The common conference information schema as is defined in [1] MUST
   include an extension point to allow new templates to hook into the
   schema and SHOULD be done using the <any namespace="##other">
   construct.


6.  XML example

   The following is an example of a common conference information
   document.  In this example, there are currently 3 participants in a
   conference, one administrator, one moderator, and one participant.
   Note that sidebars are allowed in this conference and there is one
   sidebar in the conference.  Also note that there is one floor
   moderator for the audio and a different floor moderator for the
   video.

   Note that due to RFC formatting conventions, this documents splits
   lines whose content would exceed 72 characters.  Two backslash
   character marks where this lines folding has taken place.  These
   backslash would not appear in the actual XML data model.


7.  Security Considerations

   A malicious user can manipulate parts of the Conference Information
   Data Model privileges document giving themselves and others
   privileges to manipulate the data model.  It is very important that
   only authorized clients are able to manipulate the Conference
   Information Data Model document.  Any conference control protocol
   MUST provide authentication, confidentiality and integrity.
