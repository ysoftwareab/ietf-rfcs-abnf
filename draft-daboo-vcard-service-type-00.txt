                     vCard: Service Type Parameter
                   draft-daboo-vcard-service-type-00

Abstract

   This document defines a "Service Type" parameter for use on various
   vCard properties to help clients distinguish between different types
   of communication services that may be using the same protocol, yet
   are distinct.

Internet-Draft        vCard: Service Type Parameter           March 2010


1.  Introduction and Overview

   The vCard 4.0 [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev] specification defines a
   data format for contact information.  It includes an "IMPP" property
   that is used to list instant messaging and presence information for
   the entity represented by the vCard.  One problem with this is that
   instant messaging systems on the internet today use a wide variety of
   protocols (XMPP, AIM, IRC, etc).  In addition, two service providers
   using the same protocol may not allow communication between users on
   their separate systems.  As a result, when one user needs to
   communicate with another, they need knowledge of which service
   providers, or service types, exist for the other user's "IMPP"
   properties, so that they can match that with an equivalent one that
   they have.

   This specification adds a new "SERVICE-TYPE" property parameter to
   the "IMPP" property in vCard 4.0.  This property contains a text
   token indicating the service information for use of the "IMPP"
   address value.


2.  Open Issues

   1.  Should service type values be in a registry?

   2.  What about localization of names?

   3.  Should we state that service type can be used with other
       properties (e.g.  TEL, EMAIL)?


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


4.  SERVICE-TYPE Parameter

   Parameter Name:  SERVICE-TYPE

   Purpose:  Provides a text token to help distinguish between different
      types of instant message and presence services.

Internet-Draft        vCard: Service Type Parameter           March 2010


   Description:  This parameter allows different types of instant
      message and presence services to be differentiated when used with
      the "IMPP" property.

   Format Definition:

       service-param = "SERVICE-TYPE=" param-value

   Example(s):

       IMPP;SERVICE-TYPE=EXAMPLE-TALK:xmpp:cyrus@talk.example.com
       IMPP;SERVICE-TYPE=CHATTYBOX:xmpp:cdaboo@chatty.example.org


5.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not introduce any addition security
   considerations beyond those in [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev].


6.  IANA Consideration

   This document defines the following new vCard parameters to be added
   to the registry defined in Section 10.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev]:

               +-----------+---------+--------------------+
               | Parameter | Status  | Reference          |
               +-----------+---------+--------------------+
               | DISPLAY   | Current | RFCXXXX, Section 4 |
               +-----------+---------+--------------------+

              RFC 4151, October 2005.


Appendix A.  Common Service Types

   The table below provides a suggested set of service types that
   clients can use for the "SERVICE-TYPE" parameter when used with the
   "IMPP" property.  Also listed are the expected URI schemes used for
   the "IMPP" property value.  Where there is no formal protocol or
   scheme known for a particular service, the "tag" URI scheme [RFC4151]
   is listed instead as a suggested way to indicate the identifier
   needed for the service.
