1. Abstract
   
   This memo defines how label switching controlled Frame-Relay
   and ATM interfaces can be realized given the interface stacking 
   as defined in the MPLS-LSR and MPLS-TE MIBs.

2. Introduction
   
   This memo defines how label switching controlled Frame-Relay
   [RFC3034] and ATM [RFC3035] interfaces can be realized given  
   the interface stacking as defined in the MPLS-LSR [LSRMIB] 
   and MPLS-TE [TEMIB] MIBs.  This document also contains a
   MIB module that extends the MPLS-LSR MIB's 
   mplsInterfaceConfTable in such a way as to identify which
   MPLS-type interfaces have LC-ATM or LC-FR capabilities.

   Comments should be made directly to the MPLS mailing list at
   mpls@uu.net.
   
   This memo does not, in its draft form, specify a standard for the
   Internet community.
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2119, reference [RFC2119].


3. Terminology
   
   This document uses terminology from the document describing the
   MPLS architecture [RFC3031], as well as RFC3035 and RFC3034.  
   Specifically, the following terms will be used in this document.

   LC-FR   RFC3034 defines a label switching controlled Frame Relay 
           (LC-FR) interface a Frame-Relay interface controlled by the 
           label switching control component.  Packets traversing

           such an interface carry labels in the DLCI field


   LC-ATM RFC3035 defines a label switching controlled ATM (LC-ATM) 
          interface as an ATM interface controlled by the label 
          switching control component.  When a packet traversing such 
          an interface is received, it is treated as a labeled packet.
          The packet's top label is inferred either from the contents 
          of the VCI field or the combined contents of the VPI and VCI 
          fields. Any two LDP peers which are connected via an LC-ATM
          interface will use LDP negotiations to determine which of 
          these cases is applicable to that interface.

4. The SNMP Management Framework
   
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

5. Interface Stacking Relationship for MPLS
   
   The MPLS-LSR and MPLS-TE MIBs define the media-specific
   extensions to the Interfaces Group for managing MPLS interfaces.
   They also define the conceptual interface stacking as follows.

      +------------------------------------------------+
      | MPLS tunnel interface ifType = mplsTunnel(150) |
      +------------------------------------------------+
      | MPLS-interface ifType = mpls(166)              +
      +------------------------------------------------+
      | Underlying Layer...                            +
      +------------------------------------------------+
   
   In the above diagram, MPLS-enabled interfaces are 
   represented by an ifEntry with ifType set to mpls(166).
   This subinterface is conceptually stacked above some
   underlying layer. The "Underlying Layer..." refers to the 
   ifIndex of any interface type, which has been defined for MPLS
   interworking. Examples include ATM, Frame Relay, Ethernet, etc. 
   The top-most layer defines zero or more TE tunnel interfaces
   that are conceptually stacked above the MPLS-type interface
   that carries its traffic.

6. Interface Stacking of LC-ATM

   Since LC-ATM interfaces can carry labeled MPLS traffic,
   they too are considered MPLS subinterfaces with ifType =
   mpls(166). They differ slightly in their capability
   from a packet-oriented MPLS interface in that they may
   carry ATM or Frame-Relay encapsulated traffic. It is
   thus beneficial to identify them as such. To identify 
   them as such, two tables are defined which extend the
   MPLS-LSR MIB's mplsInterfaceConfTable (see section 7 for 
   LC-ATM or 8 for LC-FR).

12.   Security Considerations
   
   This module does not define any management objects. Instead, it
   defines two new ifTypes which may be used by other MPLS MIB
   modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects. Therefore, this document has
   no impact on the security of the Internet.
