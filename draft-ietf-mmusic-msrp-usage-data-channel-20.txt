                        MSRP over Data Channels
              draft-ietf-mmusic-msrp-usage-data-channel-20

Abstract

   This document specifies how the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)
   can be transported as a WebRTC data channel sub-protocol, using the
   SDP offer/answer generic data channel negotiation framework to
   establish such a channel.  Two network configurations are supported:
   connecting two MSRP over data channel endpoints; and a gateway
   configuration, connecting an MSRP over data channel endpoint with an
   MSRP over TCP or TLS endpoint.  This document updates RFC4975.

1.  Introduction

   The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) [RFC4975] is a protocol for
   transmitting a series of related instant messages in the context of a
   session.  In addition to instant messaging, MSRP can also be used for
   image sharing or file transfer.  MSRP was initially defined in
   [RFC4975] to work over TCP and TLS connections, and over a WebSocket
   subprotocol specified by [RFC7977].

   This document specifies the negotiation and transport of MSRP over a
   WebRTC data channel [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].  Negotiation is
   carried out as specified in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg] and
   MSRP is transported as a sub-protocol of a WebRTC data channel,
   without the TCP and TLS layers.

   Defining MSRP as a data channel sub-protocol has many benefits:

Internet-Draft           MSRP over Data Channels               June 2020


   o  provides to applications a proven protocol enabling instant
      messaging, file transfer, image sharing

   o  integrates those features with other WebRTC voice, video and data
      features

   o  leverages the SDP-based negotiation already defined for MSRP

   o  allows the interworking with MSRP endpoints running on a TCP or
      TLS connection

   Compared to WebSockets, which provide a message passing protocol to
   applications with no direct access to TCP or TLS sockets, data
   channels provide a low latency transport, leverage NAT-aware
   connectivity and security features of WebRTC, and are increasingly
   available not only in modern browsers but in other applications that
   use WebRTC for media or other purposes, such as IoT or telemetry in
   general, non-media data exchange, and so on.

   Considering an MSRP endpoint as an MSRP application that uses a
   WebRTC data channel, this document describes two configurations where
   the other endpoint is respectively either another MSRP over data
   channel endpoint (e.g., a WebRTC application) or an MSRP endpoint
   using either TCP or TLS transport.

   This document updates [RFC4975] as described in Section 7.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  WebRTC Data Channel Considerations

3.1.  MSRP Data Channel

   In this document, an MSRP data channel is a data channel for which
   the instantiated sub-protocol is "msrp", and where the channel is
   negotiated using the SDP-based external negotiation method defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg].

   The following WebRTC data channel property values
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] apply to an MSRP data channel:

              +--------------------------+------------------+

4.  SDP Considerations

   This section describes the SDP considerations which are specific to
   an MSRP data channel

4.1.  MSRP URI

   This document extends the MSRP URI syntax [RFC4975] by defining the
   new transport parameter value "dc":

     transport  /= "dc"
                   ; Add "dc" to existing transports per [RFC4975]

   MSRP design provides for new transport bindings, see Section 6 of
   [RFC4975], MSRP implementations are expected to allow unrecognized
   transports for which there is no need to establish a connection to
   the resource described by the URI, as it's the case of data channels
   (Section 4.4).

4.2.  msrp-scheme

   The msrp-scheme portion of the MSRP-URI that represents an MSRP data
   channel endpoint (used in the SDP path attribute and in the MSRP
   message headers) is always "msrps", which indicates that the MSRP
   data channel is always secured using DTLS as described in
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].

4.3.  Use of the dcmap Attribute

   An offerer and answerer SHALL, in each offer and answer, include a
   dcmap attribute line ([I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg]) within
   the media description of the SCTP association for each MSRP data
   channel session to be negotiated.

   The attribute includes the following data channel parameters:

   o  "label=" labelstring

   o  "subprotocol=" "msrp"

Internet-Draft           MSRP over Data Channels               June 2020


   The labelstring is set by the MSRP application according to
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg].

   The offerer and answerer SHALL NOT include the max-retr and the max-
   time attribute parameters in the dcmap attribute.

   The offerer and answerer MAY include the ordered attribute parameter
   in the dcmap attribute.  If included, the attribute parameter value
   SHALL be set to "true".

   Below is an example of the dcmap attribute for an MSRP session to be
   negotiated with stream-id=2 and label="chat":

   a=dcmap:2 label="chat";subprotocol="msrp"

4.4.  Use of the dcsa Attribute

   An offerer and answerer SHALL, in each offer and answer, include a
   dcsa attribute line ([I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg]) within
   the media description for the SCTP association for each MSRP-specific
   SDP attribute to be negotiated for each MSRP data channel being
   negotiated.

   An offerer and answerer SHALL include a dcsa attribute for each of
   the following MSRP-specific SDP attributes:

   o  defined in [RFC4975]: "path".

   o  defined in [RFC6714]: "msrp-cema".

   o  defined in [RFC6135]: "setup".  See Section 4.5

   It is considered a protocol error if one or more of the dcsa embedded
   attributes listed above are not included in an offer or answer.

   An offerer and answerer MAY include a dcsa attribute for any of the
   following MSRP-specific SDP attributes, following the procedures
   defined for each attributes:

   o  defined in [RFC4975]: "accept-types", "accept-wrapped-types" and
      "max-size"

   o  defined in [RFC4566]: "sendonly", "recvonly", "inactive" and
      "sendrecv"

   o  defined in [RFC5547]: all the parameters related to MSRP file
      transfer.  See Section 4.7.

Internet-Draft           MSRP over Data Channels               June 2020


   A subsequent offer or answer MAY update the previously negotiated
   MSRP subprotocol attributes while keeping the same subprotocol
   a=dcmap description.  The semantics for newly negotiated MSRP
   subprotocol attributes are per [RFC4975].

   When MSRP messages are transported on a data channel, the "path"
   attribute is not used for routing of the messages.  The MSRP data
   channel is established using the SDP offer/answer procedures defined
   in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg], and the MSRP messages are
   then transported on that data channel.  This is different from legacy
   MSRP [RFC4975] but similar to MSRP CEMA [RFC6714].  However, when an
   endpoint receives an MSRP message over a data channel, it MUST still
   perform the MSRP-URI comparison procedures defined in [RFC4975].

4.5.  Use of the dcsa embedded setup Attribute

   As described in Section 4.4, the usage of a dsca embedded setup
   attribute is mandated for MSRP sessions over data channels.  It is
   used to negotiate which MSRP session endpoint assumes the active role
   as per Section 4.2.2 of [RFC6135] and Section 5.4 of [RFC4975].  It
   has no relationship with the DTLS connection establishment roles
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp].

   The dcsa embedded setup attribute is of the form "a=dcsa:x
   setup:<role>", with x being the data channel's SCTP stream
   identifier, so that such attribute is explicitly associated with an
   MSRP session over a specific data channel.

4.6.  Session Closing

   An MSRP session is closed by closing the associated data channel,
   following the procedures in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg].

   The port value for the "m=" line SHOULD NOT be changed (e.g. to zero)
   when closing an MSRP session (unless all data channels are being
   closed and the SCTP association is no longer needed), since this
   would close the SCTP association and impact all of the data channels.
   In all cases in [RFC4975] where the procedure calls for setting the
   port to zero for the MSRP "m=" line in an SDP offer for TCP
   transport, the SDP offerer of an MSRP session with data channel
   transport SHALL remove the corresponding dcmap and dcsa attributes.

   The SDP answerer must ensure that no dcmap or dcsa attributes are
   present in the SDP answer if no corresponding attributes are present
   in the received SDP offer.

4.7.  Support for MSRP File Transfer Function

   SDP attributes specified in [RFC5547] for a file transfer "m=" line
   are embedded as subprotocol-specific attributes using the syntax
   defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg].

4.8.  Example SDP Negotiation

   The following is an example of an "m=" line for data channels in an
   SDP offer that includes the attributes needed to establish two MSRP
   sessions: one for chat and one for file transfer.  The example is
   derived from a combination of examples in [RFC4975] and [RFC5547].

5.1.  Session Mapping

   In this document, each MSRP session maps to one data channel exactly.

5.2.  Session Opening

   Section 4.5 describes how the active MSRP session endpoint role is
   negotiated.  The active MSRP session endpoint uses the data channel
   established for this MSRP session by the generic data channel opening
   procedure defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg].

   As soon as the WebRTC data channel is opened, the MSRP session is
   actually opened by the active MSRP session endpoint.  In order to do
   this the active MSRP endpoint sends an MSRP SEND message (empty or
   not) to the other MSRP endpoint.

5.3.  Session Closing

   The closure of an MSRP session SHALL be signaled via SDP following
   the requirements in Section 4.6

   If the data channel used to transport the MSRP session fails and gets
   torn down, the endpoints SHALL consider the MSRP session failed.  An
   MSRP endpoint MAY, based on local policy, try to negotiate a new MSRP
   data channel.

5.4.  Data Framing

   Each text-based MSRP message is sent on the corresponding SCTP stream
   using standard MSRP framing and chunking procedures, as defined in
   [RFC4975], with each MSRP chunk delivered in a single SCTP user
   message.  Therefore all sent MSRP chunks including the MSRP chunk
   header SHALL have lengths of less than or equal to the value of the
   peer's "a=max-message-size" attribute, which is associated with the
   data channel's SCTP association.

5.5.  Data Sending, Receiving and Reporting

   Data sending, receiving and reporting procedures SHALL conform to
   [RFC4975].

5.6.  Support for MSRP File Transfer Function

   [RFC5547] defines an end-to-end file transfer method based on MSRP
   and the SDP offer/answer mechanism.  This file transfer method is
   also usable by MSRP endpoints using data channels, with the following
   considerations:

   o  As an MSRP session maps to one data channel, a file transfer
      session maps also to one data channel.

   o  SDP attributes are negotiated as specified in Section 4.7.

   o  Once the file transfer is complete, the same data channel MAY be
      reused for another file transfer.

6.  Gateway Considerations

   This section describes the network configuration where one MSRP
   endpoint uses an MSRP data channel as MSRP transport, the other MSRP
   endpoint uses TLS/TCP connections as MSRP transport, and the two MSRP
   endpoints interwork via a gateway.

   Specifically, a gateway can be configured to interwork an MSRP
   session over a data channel with a peer that does not support data
   channel transport in one of two ways.

   In one model, the gateway performs as an MSRP B2BUA to interwork all
   the procedures as necessary between the endpoints.  No further
   specification is needed for this model.

   Alternately, the gateway can provide transport level interworking
   between MSRP endpoints using different transport protocols.  In
   accordance with Section 4.4, path attributes SHALL NOT be used for
   transport level interworking.

   When the gateway performs transport level interworking between MSRP
   endpoints, all of the procedures in Section 5 and Section 4 apply to
   each peer, with the following additions:

   o  The gateway SHALL use CEMA towards the non-data channel endpoint.

   o  If the non-data channel endpoint does not support CEMA, transport
      level interworking mode is not possible, the gateway needs to act
      as an MSRP B2BUA.

   o  The gateway SHALL NOT modify the path attribute received from data
      channel or from non-data channel endpoints.

   o  The gateway SHALL NOT modify the setup value received from data
      channel or from non-data channel endpoints.

   o  The endpoint establishing an MSRP session using data channel
      transport SHALL NOT request inclusion of any relays, although it
      MAY interoperate with a peer that signals the use of relays.

7.  Updates to RFC4975

   This document updates [RFC4975], by allowing the usage of the "msrps"
   scheme when the underlying connection is protected with DTLS.

8.  Security Considerations

   MSRP traffic over data channels is secured, including
   confidentiality, integrity and source authentication, as specified by
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel]

   Note that discussion in [RFC4975] on MSRP message attribution to
   remote identities applies to data channel transport.

9.  IANA Considerations

   NOTE to RFC Editor: Please replace all instances of all instances of
   RFCXXXX with the number of this RFC.

9.1.  msrps URI scheme

   This document modifies the usage of the msrps URI scheme, registered
   by [RFC4975], adding DTLS as a protected transport indicated by the
   URI scheme.

   A reference to RFCXXXX is added to the URI scheme "msrps" in the
   Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Schemes Registry.

9.2.  Subprotocol Identifier MSRP

   This document adds a reference to the subprotocol identifier "msrp"
   in the "WebSocket Subprotocol Name Registry"

9.3.  SDP Attributes

   This document modifies the usage of the SDP setup attribute, if this
   attribute is included in an SDP 'dcsa' attribute associated to an
   MSRP data channel.  The modified usage is described in Section 4.5.

   This document also adds a reference to the following attributes in
   the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters registry, if these
   attributes are included in SDP 'dcsa' attributes associated to an
   MSRP data channel.  Usage of these attributes is described in section
   Section 4.4:

   o  "path"

   o  "msrp-cema"

Internet-Draft           MSRP over Data Channels               June 2020


11.18.  Changes against 'draft-ietf-mmusic-msrp-usage-data-channel-01'

   o  In the abstract replacement of the first sentence "This document
      specifies how the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) can be
      instantiated as a data channel sub-protocol, using the SDP offer/
      answer exchange-based external negotiation defined in
      [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg]" with "This document
      specifies how the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) can be
      instantiated as a data channel sub-protocol, using the SDP offer/
      answer exchange-based generic data channel negotiation framework"
      in order to remove the reference from the abstract text.

   o  Addition of following sentence to the second paragraph in
      Section 1: "The MSRP protocol negotiation defined in this document
      is based on the generic SDP offer/answer exchange based data
      channel negotiation as specified in
      [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg]".

   o  In Section 3.1 replacement of sub-protocol identifier "msrp" with
      "MSRP" in order to make this consistent with the formal
      specification in Section 4.3.

   o  Throughout the text replacement of "shall" with "SHALL" etc where
      appropriate as per [RFC2119].

   o  In Section 4.3 replacement of sentence 'The max-retr, max-time and
      ordered parameters shall not be used.' with 'Ordered and reliable
      data channels MUST always be used, such that the "max-retr" and
      "max-time" parameters SHALL NOT be used.  If the "ordered"
      parameter is used, then its value MUST be equal to "true".'.

   o  In Section 4.3 removal of "(on default SCTP port 5000)" from the
      sentence preceding the example "a=dcmap" attribute line.

   o  In Section 4.4 first paragraph was "The SDP offer shall also
      include a dcsa attribute line (defined in
      [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg]) within the media
      description for the SCTP association for each MSRP-specific SDP
      attribute to be negotiated for each MSRP data channel being
      negotiated.".  Replacement of this paragraph with "The SDP offer
      SHALL also include within the media description for the SCTP
      association a dcsa attribute line (defined in
      [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg]) for each MSRP-specific SDP
      attribute to be negotiated for each MSRP data channel being
      negotiated.".

   o  Appended following sentence at the end of the first paragraph of
      Section 5.4: "Therefore all sent MSRP chunks MUST have lengths of

      less than or equal to the value of the peer's "a=max-message-size"
      attribute, which is associated with the data channel's SCTP
      association.".

   o  Addition of the previously missing colon to the "a=sctp-port"
      attribute line in Section 4.8.

   o  In Section 5.3 replacement of the first paragraph "Closing of an
      MSRP session is done using the generic data channel closing
      procedure defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg]." with
      'The closure of an MSRP session MUST be signaled via an SDP offer/
      answer exchange which removes the "a=dcmap:" and "a=dcsa:"
      attribute lines associated with the MSRP session from the
      associated DTLS/SCTP based media description.  This results in the
      associated data channel being closed as well as per
      [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg], where the actual data
      channel closure procedure is typically initiated by the SDP
      answerer right after having accepted the SDP offer.'.

11.19.  Changes against 'draft-ietf-mmusic-msrp-usage-data-channel-00'

   o  Additional reference to [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg] in
      list of normative references.

   o  Replacement of previous document title "MSRP over SCTP/DTLS data
      channels" with "MSRP over Data Channels" in order to align with
      the terminology used in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg].

   o  In "terminology", "WebRTC data channel" was defined as "A
      bidirectional channel consisting of paired SCTP outbound and
      inbound streams."  Replacement of this definition with "Data
      channel: A WebRTC data channel as specified in
      [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel]", and consistent usage of either
      "data channel" or "MSRP data channel" in the remainder of the
      document."

   o  In the introduction replacement of references to
      [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol] with a reference to
      [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].

   o  Consistent usage of '"m=" line' in whole document as per
      [RFC4566].

   o  In the gateway configuration section (Section 6) replacement of
      the first sentence "This section describes the network
      configuration where one endpoint runs MSRP over a WebRTC SCTP/DTLS
      connection, the other MSRP endpoint runs MSRP over one or more
      TLS/TCP connections, and the two endpoints interwork via an MSRP

      gateway" with "This section describes the network configuration
      where one MSRP endpoint uses data channels as MSRP transport, the
      other MSRP endpoint uses TLS/TCP connections as MSRP transport,
      and the two MSRP endpoints interwork via an MSRP gateway".

11.20.  Changes against 'draft-ejzak-mmusic-msrp-usage-data-channel-01'

   o  Removed empty spaces after ";" in the examples' "a=dcmap"
      attribute lines.

   o  In all examples, the "m=" line proto value "DTLS/SCTP" was
      replaced with "UDP/DTLS/SCTP" and the "a=fmtp" attribute lines
      were replaced with "a=max-message-size" attribute lines, as per
      draft-ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp-12.

11.21.  Changes against '-00'

   o  Transport parameter change for MSRP to allow MSRP RFC transports.

   o  Clarification on SDP offer/answer and removing duplicated
      procedures and refer them to draft-ejzak-mmusic-data-channel-
      sdpneg-02.
