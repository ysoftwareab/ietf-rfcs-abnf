Internet-Draft                 SIP Payment                  October 2006


1.  Introduction

   Service usage might require some form of compensation and this is
   also true for many communication systems where an entity receiving a
   call should be able to charge the caller.  This is necessary for
   allowing fair communication between two communicating parties and is
   a major strategy for reducing the viability of SPAM.  This draft
   proposes an approach for doing this in SIP using the Security
   Assertion Markup Language (SAML).  It relies on a third party to act
   as a payment provider and is designed for low value transactions.  It
   does not aim to provide the same capability as other authentication,
   authorization and accounting backend infrastructures.

   This document creates SAML profiles and bindings in addition to those
   specified in [1].  Although this document provides a very specific
   usage scenario for SAML usage within SIP it is written in a generic
   way to support other usage scenarios following the same communication
   pattern.  This approach is inline with the idea of SAML.  The
   abstract model allows a SAML assertion or an URI reference to a SAML
   assertion to be requested from a trusted third party via HTTP.  The
   SAML assertion or URI reference is returned to the requesting party.
   Then, it is conveyed in SIP to another party that is performing an
   authorization decision based on the received information.  To resolve
   a URI reference into a SAML assertion it is additionally necessary to
   contact the trusted third party using HTTP (see [1]).

   Section 1.1 shows the basic message exchange using SAML assertions
   and Section 1.2 shows a variation with URI references to SAML
   assertions.  Both message exchanges show the high-level SIP payment
   interaction where three parties are involved:
   o  a consumer who is the caller (or SAML requester),
   o  a merchant who is the person being called (or SAML responder),
   o  and the Payment Provider (or SAML Authority).

              Figure 1: Overview for SAML Assertion Handling

   The Customer (C) and the Merchant (M) interact with each other using
   SIP and the Customer uses HTTP to exchange messages with the Payment
   Provider (P).  Initially, C makes a call to M (1).  M determines that
   a payment is required and includes information about the payment in
   an Offer body of a 402 (Payment Required) response to C (2).  C looks
   at this Offer and decides to make a payment.  The Customer instructs
   its Payment Provider to make a transfer from the Customer's account
   to the Merchants's account (3) using a request for a SAML assertion
   with the extensions defined in this document.  The Payment Provider
   returns a receipt for this transfer (4).  This receipt is a SAML
   assertion.  C resubmits the call to M but this time provides the
   Receipt for the transaction (5).  If the authorization was
   successful, M determines whether the Receipt is valid (by checking
   the digital signature and the content of the assertion) and continues
   with the call processing.

   The Offer contains information about the parties P, that are
   acceptable to M, the amount of the transaction, the account
   identifier for M at P, and random data (carried in the merchantBits
   field) to make it easier for M to avoid replay attacks.  C includes
   this information when making the Request for Payment to P; adds its
   own account information and authorization password; and sends this to
   P, which produces a Receipt for the transaction if it is successful.
   This transfer from C to P is made across an encrypted, integrity
   protected channel.  The Receipt includes a timestamp when P made the
   transaction and protects the Receipt with a digital signature.  C
   resubmits the call to M with the Receipt from P. M can check for

   replay attacks using the timestamp and the merchantBits initially
   provided with the Offer.  M can then check the signature is valid
   using P's public key.

1.2.  SAML Payment Scenario using URI References

   This section shows a variation of the message exchange presented in
   Section 1.1 with the difference that C requests a URI reference
   rather than an assertion (see message 3).  The Payment Provider
   creates a SAML assertion after authentication and authorization and
   crafts a URI reference that points to it, which is then returned to C
   as part of a successful response message (see message 4).  This URI
   reference is then forwarded to M in message 5.  When M wants to
   resolve the URI reference to an assertion it uses the 'SIP SAML URI-
   based Assertion Fetch Profile' described in Section 6.1 of [1].  This
   exchange is shown in message 6 and 7.  The receipt is carried in a
   SIP header.

   Figure 1 and Figure 2 do not show the interaction between the
   Merchant and the Customer if refunding is necessary.  Additionally,

Internet-Draft                 SIP Payment                  October 2006


   the interaction between the Merchant and the Payment Provider to
   reconcile is not shown in these two figures.  Further message
   exchanges that are shown as transition scenarios (see Section 6.4)
   finish the message exchange.

   The proposal described in this document does not aim to provide
   functionality equivalent to AAA protocols.  For example, there is no
   guarantee or recourse if M does not provide the service after C
   transfers money into M's account.  The system is designed for low
   value transactions in which, if M cheats, C can choose to never deal
   with M again but the value of the transaction is lost.  This scheme
   is designed for systems whereby the communication between M and C and
   the communication between C and P can be executed in real time.
   While it is possible to develop schemes that deal with some of these
   problems, Payment Providers deploying them have not been willing to
   provide services for transaction fees on the order of one US cent.
   The authors believe that the simplified scheme presented here will
   make it easier to reach these low value transactions.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

   This work adopts the terminology from the framework in RFC 2801 [13].

   Additionally, the following terms are used:

   Customer:

      The entity that is paying for the call, typically the SIP User
      Agent Client (UAC) or a proxy in the same administrative domain as
      the UAC.

   Merchant:

      The entity wishing to be paid for the call, typically the SIP User
      Agent Server (UAS) or a proxy in the same administrative domain as
      the UAS.

   Payment Provider:

      The third party that handles the transfer of funds from Customer
      to Merchant.  The Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP) [13]
      refers to this as the Brand.

Internet-Draft                 SIP Payment                  October 2006


   Offer:


      The information sent from the Merchant to the Customer describing
      what payment is needed.

   Request for Payment:

      The information sent from the Customer to the Payment Provider
      describing the transfer of currency needed.  This request is
      implemented as a request for a SAML assertion.

   Receipt:

      The information sent from the Payment Service Provider to the
      Customer and passed on to the Merchant.  The Receipt is either a
      SAML assertion or a URI reference to a SAML assertion.  The
      Receipt tells the Customer that the payment transaction was
      successfully completed (if either a SAML assertion or a SAML URI
      reference is returned).  The Merchant receives an assurance that
      the transaction was successful after receiving the Receipt and
      verifying it succesfully.

   Currency:

      Could be a classical currency such as the Euro or US Dollar or
      could be a pseudo currency such as airline mileage points.

   Assertion:

      An assertion is an XML document that contains authentication
      statements, attribute statements and authorization decision
      statements.  In an authentication statement, an issuing authority
      asserts that a certain subject was authenticated by certain means
      at a certain time.  In an attribute statement, an issuing
      authority asserts that a certain subject is associated with
      certain attributes which has certain values.  In an authorization
      decision statement, a certain subject with a certain access type
      to a certain resource has given certain evidence that the identity
      is correct.  The assertion is digitally signed to protect it
      against unwanted modifications by third parties.

   HTTP-based SAML URI Reference:

      The SAML URI Binding specifies a means by which SAML assertions
      can be referenced by URIs and thus be obtained through resolution
      of such URIs.  These references point to a server that temporarily
      stores an assertion.  An advantage of SAML URI Bindings is that

      they may be placed into a SIP header by intermediate SIP proxy
      elements.

   For further terminology related to SAML the reader is referred to
   [3].


3.  Requirements, Assumptions and Goals

   This section lists some basic requirements and goals for the protocol
   presented in this document.  This document extends the SIP SAML
   profile and binding described in [1] and describes a usage scenario
   utilizing these extensions, namely SIP payment.  The goals and
   assumptions below refer to the application of SAML usage for SIP
   payment.

   o  Provide a system for callers to pay the person they are calling
      using a 3rd party clearing house.  A trust relationship between
      the Merchant and the Payment Provider and between the Customer and
      the Payment Provider must exist.  The Customer must be able to
      authenticate itself to the Payment Provider and to instruct the
      Payment Provider to transfer money from its account to another
      account (i.e., the account of the Merchant).  It is not necessary
      for the Customer and Merchant to have a direct relationship with
      each other.  The Payment Provider acts as a clearinghouse.
   o  The protocol must support multiple currencies and must offer the
      ability for the Customer to learn the price before initiating a
      transaction.
   o  Support various billing models including: flat rate, per unit
      time, per unit data
   o  The solution must be cost effective for low cost transactions.
   o  The solution must allow Customers to remain anonymous towards the
      Merchants.
   o  Support for a simple refund mechanism must be provided.


4.  Non-Goals

   There needs to be a mechanism for Customers and Merchants to enroll
   and transfer money in and out of their accounts.  The mechanisms to
   accomplish this functionality are outside the scope of this document.
   They can be provided by using web forms to enroll, obtain an account
   number, and provide the typical credit card mechanism to transfer
   money into the account.  Transfers out of the account could be done
   with the typical wire transfer mechanism to bank accounts.

5.  Extended SIP SAML Profile

   Several push-based SIP Request Methods are capable (and applicable)
   of carrying a SAML assertion or URI reference, including:
   o  INVITE,
   o  REGISTER,
   o  UPDATE, and
   o  MESSAGE,

   More than one SAML assertion or URI reference to a SAML assertion MAY
   be included in the same message body part.

   While the authors do not yet see a reason to have payment receipts
   carried in the ACK, PRACK, BYE, REFER and CANCEL Methods, we do not
   see a reason to prevent carrying a SAML assertion or a URI reference
   within these Method Requests as long as the SIP message meets the
   requirements stated within this document.

   SIP end points SHOULD use SIP Identity [4] to tie the SAML assertion
   to the SIP message end-to-end.  Furthermore, in addition to the
   protection provided by SIP Identity, the security protection
   equivalent to SIPS SHOULD be used (i.e., channel security hop-by-hop
   between the involved signaling entities).  This ensures that
   eavesdroppers located along the signaling path are unable to
   eavesdrop an assertion in transit.  This is mainly a mechanism to
   ensure privacy of the transmitted information.  Since SIP proxies are
   therefore still able to see the assertion in clear it is necessary to
   include enough information in the SAML assertion in order to prevent
   replay attacks.  For more information about replay attacks regarding
   SAML and SIP the reader is referred to Section 9 of [1].

   Self-signed certificates should only be used in combination with [5]
   for protecting a SAML assertion (or a URI reference).

   SIP Methods such as SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY (in combination with
   PUBLISH) are considered a pull-based mechanism, and will be discribed
   in a future version of this document.

5.1.  New Option Tags and a SAML Header Created

   This document creates and IANA registers two new option tags, "SAML"
   or "unable-SAML".  User agent clients who support this specification
   will indicate that support by including either of these option-tags
   in a Supported header.

   This document also creates and IANA registers a new SAML header.  The
   SAML header, if present, will have one of three header values defined
   by this document:



Jennings, et al.         Expires April 26, 2007                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                 SIP Payment                  October 2006


   o  a HTTP URI Reference to a SAML assertion
   o  a Content ID indicating where the SAML assertion or URI reference
      to a SAML assertion is within the message body
   o  a SAML based option tag

   A URI reference to a SAML assertion is a pointer to a record on a
   remote node containing the SAML assertion.

   If the SAML assertion is contained in a SIP message, a SAML header
   will be present in the message with a content-ID (cid-url) [6]
   indicating where in the message body a SAML assertion or a URI
   reference is for this UA.  This is to aid a node in not having to
   parse the whole message body or body parts looking for this body
   type.

   The Unknown-SAML option tag in a SAML header indicates a UA
   understands the concept of SAML conveyance, but does not have the
   desired SAML assertion to provide.  This can save error messages from
   being generated looking for an answer the UA does not have to give.
   It can also allow a processing entity the immediate knowledge it
   needs to act as if the UA will not learn SAML on its own, and perhaps
   call on another process to address the needs for that message.

   The new "SAML" header has the following BNF syntax:


    SAML               =  "SAML" HCOLON SAML-value *(COMMA
                          SAML-value)
    SAML-value         =  (addr-spec / option-tag / token)
    addr-spec          =  cid-url / absoluteURI
    option-tag         =  string
    token              =  token / quoted-string
    cid-url            =  "cid" ":" content-id /
    absoluteURI        =  SIP or SIPS-URI
    content-id         =  url-addr-spec
    url-addr-spec      =  addr-spec ; URL encoding of RFC 822 addr-spec

   The Content-ID (cid) is defined in [6] to locate message body parts.

   The absoluteURI is the SIP or SIPS URI of the reference, which points
   at a SAML of a UA in a record on a remote node.

   The following table extends the values in Table 2/3 of RFC 3261 [7].

   The SAML header MAY be added, or read if present in a Request message
   listed above.  A proxy MAY add the SAML header in transit if one is
   not present. [7] states message bodies cannot be added by proxies.  A
   proxy MAY read the SAML header in transit if present.

   It is RECOMMENDED that only one SAML header be in the same message,
   but this is not mandatory.

   Here is an example INVITE that includes the proper SAML and Supported
   headers (without the SAML message body part):


      INVITE sip:bob@biloxi.example.com SIP/2.0
      Via: SIP/2.0/TCP pc33.atlanta.example.com

Internet-Draft                 SIP Payment                  October 2006


      --boundary1--

   The SAML header from the above INVITE:


         SAML: cid:alice123@atlanta.example.com

   indicates the Content-ID SAML [6] within the multipart message body
   of were the SAML assertion is.

   If the SAML header were this instead:


         SAML: https://example.com/assns/?ID=abcde

   this would indicate that a URI reference to a SAML assertion was
   included in this message and no SAML body would be required.

5.2.  424 (Bad SAML Information) Response Code

   In the case that a UAS or SIP intermediary detects an error in a
   Request message specific to the SAML assertion supplied by-value or
   by-reference, a new 4XX level error is created here to indicate this
   is the problem with the request message.  This document creates the
   new error code:


         424 (Bad SAML Information)

   The 424 (Bad SAML Information) Response code is a rejection of the
   SAML contents, whether by-value or by-reference of the original SIP
   Request.  The server function of the recipient (UAS or intermediary)
   has deemed this URI reference to a SAML assertion or the SAML
   assertion to be bad.  No further action by the UAC is required.  The
   UAC can use whatever means it knows to verify/refresh its SAML
   information before attempting a new request.  There is no cross-
   transaction awareness expected by either the UAS or SIP intermediary
   as a result of this error message.

   This new error code will be IANA registered in Section 13.


6.  SIP Payment Protocol

6.1.  UAC Behavior (Customer)

   The UAC SHOULD indicate that it can accept the application/charge
   MIME type in SIP requests it sends.



Jennings, et al.         Expires April 26, 2007                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                 SIP Payment                  October 2006


   In the case where the UAC receives a 402 response containing an
   application/charge body, it MUST check that this offer is acceptable
   to the user of the UAC.  This could be done using a policy that was
   previously entered by the user.  If the offer contains a Payment
   Provider with which the user has an account and the offer is
   acceptable, then the UAC sends a Request for Payment to the Payment
   Provider.

   The UAC needs to look at the available Payment Providers, cost, and
   currency and select an appropriate one.  The UAC MUST copy the
   PaymentServiceProviderData fields from the offer into the Request for
   Payment parameters.  The UAC must look at the cost elements in the
   offer to decide how large a payment the user wishes to make and set
   the amount and currency parameters appropriately.  Finally, it needs
   to fill the CustomerData parameters.  It is critical that the UAC
   check the certificate of the HTTPS TLS connection as specified in RFC
   2818 [8] and RFC 2246 [9].

   After selecting and constructing the SAML request message it is sent
   over the HTTPS secured connection.  The detailed format of the
   request is shown in Section 10.

   The response will be either an error, a SAML assertion or a URI
   reference.  The user needs to be informed if an error is received and
   the transaction SHOULD NOT be retried unchanged.  When a valid
   response is received, the UAC SHOULD resubmit the SIP request that
   caused the 402 but this time by including the Receipt (i.e., the URI
   reference or the SAML assertion).

   The UAC needs to compute the amount of payment it wishes to make by
   looking at the cost information provided as part of the Offer.  The
   UAC is also responsible for determining when a new payment has to be
   made and refreshing the call with additional payments before this
   happens.  For example, the UAC could initially decide to provide
   enough payment for a 3 minute call.  After 2.5 minutes the UAC might
   decide to pay for an additional 3 minutes.  It would do this by
   issuing a new Payment Request to the Payment Provider for an
   additional 3 minutes' worth of resources and then sending the new
   receipt with a SIP Re-INVITE or UPDATE transaction to the UAS.

6.2.  UAS Behavior (Merchant)

   When the UAS receives a request it wishes to charge for, the UAS
   should check whether the UAC has set the Accept header to include
   application/charge.  If it has, it MAY reject the request with a 402
   and attach an application/charge to the response.  Note that the
   application/charge document can be attached on any failure response.
   For example, this could allow a UAS to combine the offer with a



Jennings, et al.         Expires April 26, 2007                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                 SIP Payment                  October 2006


   request for authorization in a 401 response.  It needs to include
   lists of all the Payment Providers that are acceptable to the UAS and
   include the identity of the Merchant.  It also needs to form a list
   of currencies that are acceptable and what the cost in each one is.
   The merchant may also specify a minimum cost and/or a maximum cost in
   the offer.  The costs are described in Section 6.3.

   When the UAS receives a request that contains a Receipt (as a SAML
   assertion) as defined in [1], the UAS MUST verify that the assertion/
   artifact is valid using the following steps.
   1.  Ensure that the amount of the payment is appropriate and if this
       receipt matches to a previous Offer to prevent replay attacks.
   2.  Check that the digital signature of the Receipt is valid.  This
       includes path validation and to check that the certificate of
       Payment Provider is still valid.
   3.  Check that the time between the payment and now is acceptably
       low.  This MUST be a configurable parameter and should default to
       30 seconds.  The UAS SHOULD support NTP RFC 1305 [14].  [Editor's
       Note: Is this mechanism really needed?]
   4.  The UAS MUST check that this receipt has not been previous used.
       The limited time window limits the amount of state the UAS must
       keep to make this check.  If several UASs are using the same
       merchant-id, this replay detection needs to be done across all
       the UASs.  The OfferData can be used with opaque encrypted data
       to help do this.

   If the payment is accepted, it the Merchant's responsibility to end
   the call after the amount paid becomes inadequate to cover the
   session.  The UAS SHOULD use a mechanism like that specified in SIP
   session timer [15].  The UAC MAY send a re-INVITE or an UPDATE
   message with a new receipt for a payment to prolong the session.

   There are certain cases where the Merchant may wish to offer a
   refund.  This could occur if the Customer has prepaid for a 10 minute
   session and the call terminates after 1 minute.  In this case, the
   Merchant may wish to provide a refund for the 9 minutes that were not
   used.  Alternatively, the Customer could provide a receipt to place a
   call but the destination is busy.  In this case, the Merchant would
   likely want to provide a full refund.

   The refund mechanism is simple and identical to the Payment Request
   procedure described in Section 6.1.  In this case, the Merchant posts
   a Payment Request to the Payment Provider specified in the Payment
   Receipt.

   If the call ends early or can not be completed, it may still be
   possible that the Customer has provided a receipt of payment where no
   service has been delivered.  This may have occurred due to an

Internet-Draft                 SIP Payment                  October 2006


   upstream proxy error or a network connectivity problem between the
   UAC and the UAS.  Since the receipt of payment was never delivered to
   the UAS, there is no immediate mechanism of delivering a refund to
   the Customer.

6.3.  Computing costs

   There are three types of costs:
   o  initial setup costs,
   o  costs per second, and
   o  cost per unit data.
   All three costs are added together to form the total cost and are
   assumed to be zero if not specified.  The cost of the first time unit
   block size worth of time and the first data unit block size of data
   are considered to be included in the initial connection or setup
   costs.

   For example, if a call costs 30 cents to connect and then 12 cents
   per minute and is billed in 15 second increments (rounded down), the
   cost would be set so that the currency was USD and the currency
   divisor (power of 10) was 1000 making the initial cost 300, the cost
   per unit time is 40, and the time unit size is 15000.  If the time is
   to be rounded up, then some extra to cover the price of the first
   increment would be added to the connect cost.

   Note that the additional specification of a currency divisor allows
   all currency amounts to be specified in fixed point.  In the above
   example, a currency divisor of 1000 means that all currency amounts
   are in tenths of a cent (USD).

6.4.  Transition Scenarios

   The deployment of the mechanisms described in this document might
   take place incrementally.  This section provides some information
   about two likely transition scenarios: Merchant Proxy and Customer
   Proxy.

6.4.1.  Merchant Proxy

   In this scenario, the Customer places a call to a Merchant where the
   Merchant's UAS does not implement this mechanism.  The Merchant's
   Proxy acts on behalf of the Merchant.  The key difference here is
   that the Merchant's proxy must use SAML URI references instead of
   SAML assertions and an extra step must be taken by the Proxy to
   validate the URI reference with the Payment Provider.

   Note: Many of the normal steps in a SIP call flow have been left out
   of this example to focus on the pertinent items.

   F1 INVITE: Customer -> Merchant Proxy

   The Customer sends a SIP INVITE which arrives at the Merchant's
   Proxy.

   F2 402 + Payment Offer: Merchant Proxy -> Customer

   The Merchant's Proxy, acting on behalf of the Merchant, sends a 402
   response with a Payment Offer back to the Customer.  The Payment
   Offer must indicate that the Payment Provider must provide a URI
   reference rather than a SAML assertion as a Receipt.

   F3 Request for Payment: Customer -> Payment Provider

   Based on the contents of the Payment Offer, the Customer makes a
   Request for Payment to one of the specified Payment Providers.  The
   Request for Payment specifies that the Payment Provider should return
   a URI reference.

   F4 Receipt (Artifact): Payment Provider -> Customer

Internet-Draft                 SIP Payment                  October 2006


   The Payment Provider transfers the appropriate funds to the
   Merchant's account and returns a URI reference to the Customer.

   F5 Invite + Receipt: Customer -> Merchant Proxy

   The Customer inserts a new header containing the URI reference into
   the INVITE request.

   F6 180: Merchant Proxy -> Customer

   The Merchant Proxy immediately sends a 180 response to the Customer
   indicating that the Receipt is being validated with the Payment
   Provider.

   F7 URI Reference: Merchant Proxy -> Payment Provider

   The Merchant Proxy, acting on behalf of the Merchant, requests the
   SAML assertion from the Payment Provider by providing the URI
   reference.

   F8 Assertion: Payment Provider -> Merchant Proxy

   The SAML assertion is returned to the Merchant Proxy.

   F9 INVITE: Merchant Proxy -> Merchant

   Since the SAML assertion was valid, and was not used before by this
   Merchant, the Merchant Proxy forwards the INVITE request to the
   Merchant.

6.4.2.  Customer Proxy

   In this example, the Customer endpoint does not implement this
   payment mechanism so the Customer's Edge Proxy acts on behalf of the
   Customer.  Note that the Merchant's Proxy has been left out of the
   example.

   F1 INVITE: Customer -> Customer Proxy

   The Customer sends an INVITE to the Customer's Edge Proxy (in the
   same administrative domain as the Customer).

   F2 100: Customer Proxy -> Customer

   The Customer's Proxy sends a 100 response to the Customer in order to
   quench retransmissions.

   F3 INVITE: Customer Proxy -> Merchant

   The Customer's Proxy forwards the request to the Merchant.  In most
   cases, the Merchant will also have a Proxy but this has not been
   indicated in this example.

   F4 402 + Payment Offer: Merchant -> Customer Proxy

   The Merchant sends back a 402 response with a Payment Offer to the
   Customer's Proxy.

   F5 Request Payment: Customer Proxy -> Payment Provider

   The Customer Proxy, acting on behalf of the Customer, makes a Request
   for Payment to the selected Payment Provider specifying that a URI
   reference is to be returned.  It is assumed that the Customer's Proxy
   would have the payment credentials and Payment Provider preferences
   for the Customer.

   F6 Receipt (URI Reference): Payment Provider -> Customer Proxy

   The Receipt is returned as a URI reference.

   F7 INVITE + Receipt: Customer Proxy -> Merchant

   The Customer Proxy now inserts the URI reference as a SIP header in
   the INVITE request to be sent to the Merchant.

   F10 Artifact: Merchant -> Payment Provider

   The Merchant pulls the URI reference from the INVITE and sends a
   request to the specified Payment Provider to return the SAML
   assertion.

   F11 Assertion: Payment Provider -> Merchant

   When the SAML assertion is verified, the Merchant completes the call
   and sends a 200 OK response.

6.5.  Payment Provider Behavior

   The primary function of the Payment Provider is to receive Requests
   for Payments over HTTPS, to transfer the currency from one account to
   another one, and to return a Receipt over HTTPS.

   A Payment Provider MUST support TLS to offer channel security (with
   integrity, replay and confidentiality protection).

   When a Payment Provider receives a Request for Payment, it performs
   the following steps:
   1.  Verify that the customer-id corresponds to a valid account and
       that the presented credentials are correct for the given account.
       If either the account is invalid or the authentication of the
       account holder was not succesfull then an error message MUST be

       returned.  The procedure for responding with error responses is
       described in the respective SAML specifications and the Payment
       Provider MUST respect the SAML specific message processing
       handling.
   2.  it MUST validate that the currency is acceptable by the Merchant
   3.  it MUST ensure that the Customer has sufficient funds, and
   4.  it MUST verify that the account identifier of the Merchant
       corresponds to a valid account.
   5.  it MUST create a Receipt as a SAML assertion (or a URI reference)
       by setting the corresponding fields in the assertion.
   6.  it MUST set the Date to the current time.
   7.  it MUST digitally sign the assertion.
   8.  it MUST transfer the money from the customer's account to the
       merchant's account.
   9.  it MUST return either the assertion or the Artifact back to the
       payment requesting entity (depending on the request).

6.6.   Merchant Fetching Public Key

   The Merchant needs to be able to fetch the Payment Provider's public
   key.  This MAY be done by an HTTPS request to a URI provided by the
   Payment Service Provider.  The Merchant MAY use some standard online
   certificate revocation mechanism to protect against the private key
   being compromised.  Note that the Payment Provider may wish to use
   signing certificates that are only valid for a short period of time.
   The duration should be determined by the Payment Provider based on
   the amount of money at risk.


7.   SIP Extensions

7.1.  Update response code 402

   This document updates the 402 response code in RFC 3261 [7] to mean
   that "A Payment is Required".  Other mechanisms are used to indicate
   what type of payment is required.  In this specification, a
   particular MIME body type indicates the type of payment required.  A
   single 402 may indicate that more than one type of payment is
   required.  Both proxies and UASs can issue a 402 response code.


8.  Syntax

8.1.  Payment Offer

   The Payment Offer contains a list of costs and a list of Payment
   Providers.  The Customer can choose to pay any one of the provided
   costs and can choose any one of the Payment Providers to use, as long



Jennings, et al.         Expires April 26, 2007                [Page 21]

   as the Payment Provider supports the currency for the chosen cost.  A
   Merchant can also specify a currency namespace with a particular
   cost.  This allows the Merchant to create non-standard currencies,
   e.g., airline mileage/points.  A cost can also specify an optional
   minimum and/or maximum cost.

   The currency is specified as 3 uppercase letters using the ISO
   currency code from ISO.4217.  All cost attributes (initialCost,
   costPerUnitTime, costPerUnitData, minCost, maxCost) are specified in
   currency units where the actual cost is to be divided by
   currencyDivisor.  All amounts are base 10 integers with no leading
   zeros and zero is not a valid entry.  The timeUnitSize is in
   milliseconds.  The dataUnitSize is in octets. merchantBits and
   pspBits are base 64 encoded data

   Each PaymentServiceProvider provided in a Payment Offer has a
   serviceUrl attribute which is where the PaymentRequest will be sent
   to.  There is also an optional url attribute which is a general HTTP
   URL that can provide information about the specific Payment Provider.

   A simple example is provided with a single charge for a single
   Payment Provider where the initial cost is $0.25 and the charge is
   0.06/minute charged in 6 second increments.

8.2.  Request for Payment

   In order to make the generation of the Request for Payment as simple
   as possible for both the Customer and the Payment Provider, the
   RequestForPayment is constructed as a SAML Request.  The Request for
   Payment consists of four components:

   o  The OfferData is copied from the Payment Offer from the Merchant.
   o  The PaymentServiceProviderData is selected from the possible
      Payment Providers by the Customer.




Jennings, et al.         Expires April 26, 2007                [Page 23]

Internet-Draft                 SIP Payment                  October 2006


   o  The amount that needs to be payed.
   o  Additionally, the Customer might provide authentication
      credentials as part of the SAML request.

   Note that it is up to the Customer to select a currency.

   The OfferData consists of the following fields from the Payment
   Request: offerExpiry and merchantBits.

   The PaymentServiceProviderData is copied from the chosen Payment
   Provider/Cost in the Payment Request consisting of the following
   fields: merchantId, serviceUrl, pspBits, currencyNamespace,
   currencyDivisor, and currency.

   The CustomerData is provided by the Customer and consists of the
   following fields: customerId, customerAuth, customerBillingCode and
   an amount.  The customerBillingCode is optional and could be stored
   by the PaymentServiceProvider and included in the transaction history
   for the convenience of the Customer.  The amount divided by
   currencyDivisor indicates the amount of funds being requested to be
   transferred from the Customer to the Merchant in currency units.  The
   customerId is a token identifying the Customer's account with the
   Payment Provider and the customerAuth is the authentication
   credentials.

   The SAML Request MUST be TLS protected.  Authentication of the client
   MUST be provided, either as part of the TLS handshake or using SAML
   specific mechanisms.

   The XML schema of the Payment Request is shown in Section 10.

   Below is an example 'Payment Request' based on the previous 'Offer'
   example with a payment of $0.30.

   The following XML instance document shows a AuthnRequest that was
   extended to carry the parameters for a payment request.

   document shown in Figure 13 can be found in Section 10.3.

8.4.  Refunds

   Refunds share the same syntax as a Request for Payment.  The refund
   fields populated from the Receipt are: offerId, offerExpiry,
   merchantBits, merchantId, serviceUrl, pspBits, currencyNamespace,
   currencyDivisor, and currency.  The customerId and customerAuth refer
   to the Merchant's account information referenced by the serviceUrl.
   The amount to refund is determined by the Merchant at the time of the
   refund.

   Editor's Note: Add an example here.

8.5.  Verifying the Receipt

   The Merchant MUST verify the signature in the Receipt by applying the
   following steps:
   1.  Check ReceiptData.Date.  If too old, reject.
   2.  Check whether receipt-id has been accepted in a previous payment
       since the TTL used by the UAS.  If so, reject.
   3.  Check whether Offer comes from this UAS.  If not, reject.
   4.  Perform RSA signature verification.  UAS chooses the public key
       based on PaymentServiceProvider-id.

9.  Usage Scenarios for SIP Payment

   This section shows the applicability of SIP payment for two example
   scenarios.

9.1.  SPAM

   Payment at risk has been suggested as part of a possible solution to
   SPAM in VoIP systems [16].  The idea is that A would call B. If A was
   not on B's white list, B could ask A to pay 5 cents for the privilege
   of ringing B's phone.  A could pay, and if B wished, B could refund
   the 5 cents by simply doing a second payment from B to A. The payment
   service provider would collect two transaction fees in this scenario.

   Another possible scenario is that B simply requests that A donate 5
   cents to one of B's favorite charities and show B the receipt for
   this transaction.

9.2.  Micro Billing

   In this scenario, a merchant running a PSTN GW may charge a customer
   5 cents to connect and operate for the first 90 seconds and then may
   charge 5 more cents for each additional minute.  The customer would
   initially transfer 5 cents and then, before the 90 seconds ran out,
   would transfer another 5 cents and keep on doing this until the call
   ended.


10.  XML Schemas

   This section defines the XML schema for the protocol introduced in
   this document.

10.1.  PaymentOffer XML Schema

   This section shows the XML schema for the PaymentOffer that the
   Merchant sends to the Customer.

                        Payment Receipt XML Schema


11.  HTTP Binding

   This section defines an HTTP [10] binding for the protocol between
   the Customer and the Payment Provider, which all conforming
   implementations MUST support.

   The three request messages are carried in this binding as the body of
   an HTTP POST request.  The MIME type of both request and response
   bodies should be "application/xml", except that a SAML assertion
   SHOULD have the MIME type "application/samlassertion+xml".

   The Payment Provider SHOULD populate the HTTP headers so that they
   are consistent with the contents of the message.  In particular, the
   "Expires" and cache control headers SHOULD be used to control the
   caching of any SAML assertion.  The HTTP status code SHOULD have the
   same first digit as any "contextResponse" or "error" body included,
   and it SHOULD indicate a 2xx series response when a SAML assertion is
   included.

   This binding also includes a default behaviour, which is triggered by
   a GET request, or a POST with no request body.  In this case, the
   Payment Provider MUST attempt to provide a SAML assertion.

   This binding MUST use TLS as described in [8].  TLS provides message
   integrity and confidentiality between the Customer and the Payment
   Provider.  The Payment Provider MUST use server-side authentication.
   Client authentication can either be provided as part of the TLS
   handshake or using HTTP specific mechanisms.


12.  Security Considerations

   The security properties of the proposed protocol depends on the
   security of the communication between the three parties.  The
   following threats and countermeasures have been considered:



Jennings, et al.         Expires April 26, 2007                [Page 34]

Internet-Draft                 SIP Payment                  October 2006


12.1.  Stolen Assertion

   Threat:

      An adversary can eavesdrop on the communication between the
      Customer and the Payment Provider and between the Customer and the
      Merchant and thereby learn the SAML assertion (Receipt).  The
      adversary could use this assertion to request a service from the
      Merchant on behalf of the legitimate Customer.

   Countermeasures:

      Two countermeasures are provided to deal with this treat.  The
      communication between the Customer and the Payment Provider must
      be confidentiality, integrity and replay protected.  The
      communication between the Customer and the Merchant SHOULD
      experience hop-by-hop protection (e.g., TLS in a hop-by-hop
      fashion between the Customer, SIP proxies and the Merchant) and
      end-to-end security using the SIP Identity mechanism.
      Furthermore, the content of the requested SAML assertion contains
      statements that prevent reusage of the SAML assertion in other
      contexts.  The Offer, for example, provides a merchantBits value
      that allows the Merchant to match the Offer to the Receipt.  The
      identities of the Customer and the Merchant are included in the
      Receipt and the lifetime might be limited.

12.2.  MitM Attack

   Threat:

      Since the SAML assertion is carried within a SIP message sent by
      the Customer towards the Merchant an intermedidate SIP proxy could
      use the assertion in order to impersonate the user towards the
      Merchant in future protocol sessions.

   Countermeasures:

      This document does not assume that the assertion is bound to a
      symmetric or an asymmetric key although SAML provides this
      capability using the holder-of-the-key concept.  If there is no
      such holder-of-the-key concept utlized with the assertion then
      only the content of the assertion can be used to prevent replay
      attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks.  Similarly to the threat
      described in Section 12.1 the content of the assertion limits its
      usage to particular endpoints, potentially for a particular
      duration, for a particular service and for certain amount of time.

12.3.  Forged Assertion

   Threat:

      A malicious Customer or a malicious intermediate SIP proxy could
      forge or alter a SAML assertion in order to communicate with the
      Merchant to lead to unexpected behavior or even to refunding to a
      preselected account.

   Countermeasures:

      To avoid this kind of attack, the Payment Provider must assure
      that proper mechanisms for protecting the SAML assertion is
      provided.  It is RECOMMENDED to protect the assertion using a
      digital signature.

12.4.  Replay Attack

   Threat:

      An adversary might eavesdrop an assertion in order to later replay
      it to gain access to resources (e.g., to access a SIP service).

   Countermeasures:

      When the Customer transmits a SIP message that requires payment
      then the Merchant creates an Offer that contains a merchantBits
      value.  The Offer will be used by the Customer to obtain an
      assertion by the Payment Provider and will again be presented to
      the Merchant.  The Merchant is therefore able to determine whether
      the merchantBits is still valid and that it can be associated with
      an Offer.  The Offer is only valid for a certain time.  Timestamp
      information carried inside the assertion might also indicate a
      validity timeframe.
