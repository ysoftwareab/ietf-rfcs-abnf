1.  Introduction

   With recent changes in the IETF and ways in which interested parties
   participate, there is a push to overhaul the mechanisms that are
   provided for remote participation and working group meeting
   archiving.

   For the past several years, two sessions have been multicast at two
   or more bit rates (low and high).  These sessions have also been
   recorded and made available relatively soon after the meeting.  More
   recently, experiments have been conducted in an attempt to add
   additional rooms with unicast support but only audio.

   At this point, the IETF is at a cross-roads.  Because of perceived
   changes in remote participant needs and funding availability, the
   IETF needs to decide what is needed in terms of service to users.
   Furthermore, an analysis needs to be done on what this service will
   cost and whether there is budget to support it.

   This document proposes one possible approach, intended to expand
   meeting coverage while reducing the volunteers required to support
   this effort.

2.  Historical Efforts

   Since IETF 49 the University of Oregon Videolab in collaboration with
   the University of California Santa Barba, various corporate partners
   the Secretariat and the IETF chair have scheduled and then multicast,
   the working groups that meet in 2 of the 6 to 8 parallel tracks
   scheduled every day while the IETF meets.

2.1  Equipment

   At present the resources required for each track recorded  are as
   follows:
   o  two cameras
   o  a VGA scan converter
   o  video source selector
   o  audio distribution amplifier
   o  3 cable runs of approximately 15-20M
   o  as many PCs to encode as source formats are required
   o  an ethernet switch attached to a multicast capable network
   o  a kvm switch, monitor keyboard and mouse
   o  1 Camera operator per track is required, in practice 2 to 3
      volunteers per track spell each other over the course  of the week
   o  1 person and an additional host computer are required  to monitor
      the encoder hosts and output for both tracks

2.2  Expenses

   Typically the University of Oregon has provided 2 to 3 persons and
   shipped the bulk of the equipment (Cameras reside with the
   secretariat).  Additional volunteers from UCSB and elsewhere have be
   funded through the IETF chair's ISOC funds or through the meeting
   local host, if provided  by them.  Domestically in the United States
   expenses run about $2000 per person for the duration of the meeting,
   internationally $3000 and up depending on the meeting location.
   Shipping equipment has cost anywhere from $5000 domestically to
   $10,000 internationally.

2.3  Shortcomings

   The current effort, despite all it successes has several obvious
   shortcomings:
   o  Multicast deployment is required at end sites in order to receive
      multicast sources.  While one of the University of Oregon's
      principle goals was and is multicast network deployment
      evangelism, many people who would like to receive the sources have
      little or no control over their network transport and are
      therefore unable to receive the sources.


Jaeggli                   Expires July 30, 2005                 [Page 4]
Internet-Draft                  IETFTV-NG                   January 2005

   o  Poor scaling properties.  While multicast delivery had decent
      scaling properties if audience size increases, covering one
      additional room under the current model requires a 50% increase in
      manpower and equipment.  covering all 8 tracks would require on
      the order of a 4 fold increase in manpower and equipment
   o  Equipment is expensive to ship and aging.  The cameras (purchased
      by the IETF chair) are close to 6 years old.  The kit of equipment
      provided by the University of Oregon is the third generation of
      equipment we have invested in, nevertheless  large parts of it are
      approaching 3 years old.  The kit is increasingly hard for The U
      of O to maintain.  Shipping it, (2 large and 1 small flight cases,
      about 200KG) represents the largest single expense  in supporting
      the IETF multicast
   o  Poor clarity of mission.  There are at least three major
      constituencies who are served by the multicast effort, none
      particularly well, remote participants and observers are placed at
      a disadvantage by the multicast requirements, the lack of complete
      meeting coverage and the subsequent gaps in the archive.  IETF
      attendees have expressed a desire, to be able to monitor the
      activities of one working group while participating in another,
      and likewise are not well served by an incomplete record.
      Consumers of the record only, obviously have the same limitations
      due to coverageas the previous two groups

3.  New Effort

   The new effort should meet three simple goals.  It should be
   accessible to people with or without multicast connectivity,
   including availability on  the wireless network for those attending
   the meeting, without adverse performance implications.  It should be
   able to cover as many tracks as are scheduled in parallel.  It should
   be sufficiently inexpensive that it can be funded as part of the
   ongoing operation of the IETF.

   The proposal Hinges on delivering a basic, audio-only  unicast stream
   using a purpose-built but off-the-shelf hardware kit, and remote
   servers, leveraging the reduction in production resources (hardware,
   camera operators, management) to control costs while expanding to
   cover the whole IETF meeting schedule.

3.1  Software Platform

   For IETF 60 and 61 we experimented in a  limited basis (4 rooms at
   60, 2 rooms at 61) with an application, MUSE <http://muse.dyne.org>
   that provided a command line, curses, and X11 interface to stream via
   unicast http an mp3 or ogg audio stream through an Icecast 1 or 2
   style server application or interoperable implementation such as
   Shoutcast or the Apple Darwin streaming server.  Client support for
   this type of unicast delivery appears broad, with most platform's
   native media players (Quicktime, Real, Winamp, Mplayer, Windows Media
   Player, etc) being able to handle the stream, allowing us to leverage
   the current popularity of MP3 streaming used by internet-radio
   applications.  Muse has several desirable properties:
   o  It is open source, and is under active development.
   o  As a command-line application it can be operated and monitored
      remotely relatively easily.
   o  It is capable of simultaneously streaming and recording the mp3
      audio stream.
   o  It can embed a limited amount of meta-data in the recording and
      the stream about the program being received

   It is envisioned that a single operator can simultaneously monitor
   all eight of the streaming boxes from a central location, experience
   gained during ietf60 suggest that this is feasible.

3.2  Hardware Platform

   The hardware platform will consist of small headless (no keyboard or
   monitor) computers running Linux capable of being centrally managed.
   For audio-only streaming the principle requirements are a supported
   full-duplex sound chipset with microphone and line-level inputs,
   ethernet and a local drive for recording.  Additionally form-factor


Jaeggli                   Expires July 30, 2005                 [Page 6]
Internet-Draft                  IETFTV-NG                   January 2005

   should dictate purchasing, it would be highly desirable if 8 of these
   units were sufficiently small the be packable as lugguage.  One
   possible configuration might be built around mini-itx platform
   (17x17cm motherboard) would contain a 1ghz via c3 processor 256MB of
   ram a 40GB drive and be approximately 170x50x250mm and 2kg.  Such
   units could be sourced for $500 or less each.  While that is
   approximately the cost of an inexpensive laptop, mini-itx computers
   are about 1/2 the volume and weight of a laptop offering.  A Dell
   Inspiron 1150 for example retails for $699 but is 45x329x275mm and
   about 3.5kg

   Miscellaneous additional hardware items needed to support recording
   are some kind of management workstation, (a laptop could be pressed
   into service there) cables to mate with the room mixer, various
   length ethernet jumpers and appropriate luggage for hardware to
   travel in.  In total initial equipment outlay ought to cost less than
   $5000.

   Equipment that will have have to be purchased immediatly, to be owned
   by the IETF:
   o  8 audio streaming hosts at $500ea
   o  Luggage style flight-case suitable to transport 8 hosts plus
      appropiate cable $500
   o  Misc cables to support various audio interconnects $200

   Equipment that can provided through volunteer efforts (Joel Jaeggli):
   o  Management workstation
   o  Room Length Ethernet runs
   o  Misc cables to support various audio interconnects

3.3  Server Resources

   Unlike the multicast services which requires no servers to deliver
   streams to clients, for the unicast streams sufficient server
   resources and transit bandwidth must be available to serve client
   demand.  As delivered mp3 audio streams will vary between 32 and
   64Kb/s multiplied by the number of clients joined.  During the IETF
   60 test, peak utilization of ~40 clients never exceeded 2.5Mb/s.
   While it is possible that servers could be located on the IETF
   conference network, doing so places an additional, possibly
   undesirable expectation on  the host, According the University of
   Oregon and ISI's Postel center have offered to host servers.  A
   server is a Linux or UNIX host running the Darwin Streaming Server or
   shoutcast 2 server, additional servers can be deployed when resources
   are insufficient on existing servers.  At present, the University of
   Oregon has two such servers available.

Internet-Draft                  IETFTV-NG                   January 2005

3.4  Meeting Room Requirements

   In some key respects, delivering unicast audio will reduce
   requirements on the secretariat, hosting entity, working group
   chairs, participants and multicast volunteers, it adds some
   requirements as well.
   o  Currently the secretariat schedules multicast rooms, this will no
      longer be required as all rooms will be covered.
   o  Currently the hosting  entity is responsible for providing an
      ethernet drop in each multicast room on a multicast enabled
      subnet, instead one drop per meeting room will be required,
      attached to either the terminal room or general conference
      network.  Meeting room connectivity can leverage the network built
      to support the wireless in most cases.
   o  A sound system will have to provided in all rooms  where recording
      is desired, presently one is provided in most rooms.  Costs of
      providing sound for additional rooms if necessary are best
      determined by the secretariat.
   o  Working group chairs and participants will need to enforce
      microphone discipline, stating their name for the record and using
      the microphone for meeting participation.

3.5  Volunteer Requirements

   The volunteer requirements ought to be as low as two person outside
   of the additional requirements placed on the secretariat and the
   host.  Two volunteers should all one person to monitor all 8 rooms
   and remote servers while the other is free for trouble-shooting and
   post production tasks.  Additional host requirements (more network
   drops) ought to be offset by the reduced complexity of the network
   and the fact that it leverages network assets that have to be
   deployed anyway

   Costs associated with funding volunteers should be similar to current
   expenses.  On a per-person basis, order of $2000 per meeting
   domestically in the United States (assuming volunteers originate from
   there).  Reimbursable expenses will be submitted through the IETF
   chair.

3.6  Post Production

   Currently post production of video captured during the IETF is quite
   an  involved process, and due to the size of the files created, and
   the overhead of delivering transcoded video  for the archive can
   require several weeks of volunteer effort.  The only post production
   the audio recording should require would be removal of any audio
   recorded prior to the commencement or after the completion of the
   meeting and the amending of timestamped filenames to a format that


Jaeggli                   Expires July 30, 2005                 [Page 8]
Internet-Draft                  IETFTV-NG                   January 2005

   allows the identification of each meeting.  It is envisioned that
   principle post production tasks for audio can be performed during the
   course of an IETF meeting and the finished product should be
   available to observers and attendees before the minutes are
   published, much as the raw unedited video files are now.

3.7  Expenditures

   This proposal has about $5000 in immediate expenditures related to
   hardware purchases.  Additionally, recurring costs to provide two
   volunteers to support the, effort are estimated at around $4000 per
   meeting.  This proposal may place finacial expectations on the
   secretariat if sound systems have to be provided in additional rooms
   above and beyond what would otherwise be provisioned.

   Summary of the IETF-TV BoF
      BoF Chair: Ole Jacobsen
      Notes taken by: Aaron Falk

   The purpose of the IETF-TV BoF was to discuss in what way multimedia
   capture of IETF meetings would best serve the community.  Multicast
   was used by volunteers to provide audio and digital whiteboard tools
   starting in 1992.  Tools and encoding formats evolved over the years
   until the present day where two rooms at each IETF are covered using
   MPEG-1 video and H.261/PCM audio four additional rooms with MP3 audio
   only.  The streams are made available using ASM and SSM multicast
   (some individuals provide unicast reflectors) and the files are
   post-processed and stored in an online repository for viewing after
   the meeting.

   At IETF-60, there were about 20 "viewers" per meeting (ed: IETF or wg
   meeting?) with a peak of about 70.  Feedback from the audio-only
   sessions was that it was hard to follow the meeting without some
   visual feedback, preferably the ability to view the slides.  There
   have been 100's to 1000's of downloads of online files.

   The staffing and travel and equipment expenses have been borne by
   University of Oregon (UofO) with some assistance from Cisco and the
   IETF Chair fund.  Typical requirements are 6 weeks/year for
   preparation; staffing and post-processing, 4-6 people (historically
   students) to operate the equipment during the IETF meeting; $10k for
   shipping (ed: per meeting?  per year?); bandwidth for streaming and
   download (broadband, real-time bandwidth and server requirements are
   non-trivial).  However, most of the expense is associated with the
   video capture: camera operators (labor and travel) and specialized
   equipment are required.  The UofO is unwilling to shoulder staffing,
   and has run out of Cisco-provided funding that allowed their staff to
   travel and ship their equipment.  The UofO never provided any
   significant financial support outside of staff.  Several questions
   therefore arise:

   What problem is being solved by this service?  Remote participation?
   Broadcast to a remote (non-participatory) audience?  Creating a
   public record?

   It is estimated that a professional staff would cost about
   ~$50k/meeting (based on similar hotel events).  Various strategies of
   cost recovery were discussed including increasing meeting fees
   (~$25), charging online viewers ($100), selling CDs (~$100ea) or
   finding sponsors (~$25k/yr).  There was a general conclusion that
   some form of service is useful and of interest but there were no
   clear recommendations identifying a primary audience or of cost
   recovery.

   No working group will be created from this BoF.

Appendix B.  Appendix 2 - Possible Hardware Configuration

   One of The lessons to be taken away from previous efforts is that
   shipping and maintenance of the equipment necessary to provide the
   former service was one of the most expensive and time-consuming parts
   of the effort.  With that mind, and the goal of simplifying the
   equipement, a more compact, rugged, and inexpensive computer is
   needed.  The actual cpu requirements for audio encoding are
   signficantly more lightweight than delivering mpeg-4 video, a great
   assistance in reducing the scale of the equipment necessary to
   support this effort.

   One possible configuration that would be appropriate for our
   application follows (all costs are approximate):
   o  Casetronic c134 aluminum chassis (dimesions 177 x 50 x 254mm) 60w
      external powesupply        $150
   o  Via epia m1000 mainboard integrated ethernet, sound, video,
      ieee1394, usb2 1ghz via c3 cpu $160
   o  256MB unbuffered pc2100 ddr dimm memory module $50
   o  40GB 2.5" laptop harddrive $80
   o  cable lock $20
   o  Total: $460
