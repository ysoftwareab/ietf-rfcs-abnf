   a security association with its Home Agent before it can start
   utilizing Mobile IPv6.  RFC 3775 requires that some or all of these
   parameters are statically configured.  Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping work
   aims to make this information dynamically available to the Mobile
   Node.  An important aspect of the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping solution
   is to support interworking with existing authentication,
   authorization and accounting infrastructure.  This document describes
   the MIPv6 bootstrapping using the Diameter Network Access Server
   (NAS) to home Authentication, Authorization and Accounting server
   (HAAA) interface.

Internet-Draft   Diameter MIPv6 NAS to HAAA Interaction         May 2007


1.  Introduction

   The Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) specification [1] requires a Mobile Node (MN)
   to perform registration with a Home Agent (HA) with information about
   its current point of attachment (Care-of Address).  The HA creates
   and maintains binding between the MN's Home Address and the MN's
   Care-of Address.

   In order to register with a HA, the MN needs to know some information
   such as the Home Link prefix, the HA address, the Home Address(es),
   the Home Link prefix Length and security association related
   information.

   The aforementioned set of information may be statically provisioned
   in the MN.  However, static provisioning of this information becomes
   an administrative burden for an operator.  Moreover, static
   provisioning does not address load balancing, failover, opportunistic
   home link assignment and assignment of local home agents in close
   proximity to the MN.  Also the ability to react on sudden
   environmental or topological changes is minimal.  Static provisioning
   may not be desirable, in light of the mentioned limitations.

   Dynamic assignment of MIPv6 home registration information is a
   desirable feature for ease of deployment and network maintenance.
   For this purpose, the AAA infrastructure, which is used for access
   authentication, can be leveraged to assign some or all of the
   necessary parameters.  The Diameter server in Access Service
   Provider's (ASP) or in Mobility Service Provider's (MSP) network may
   return these parameters to the AAA client.  Regarding the
   bootstrapping procedures, the AAA client might either be the NAS, in
   case of the integrated scenario, or the HA, in case of the split
   scenario [6].  The terms integrated and split are described in the
   terminology section and were introduced in [7] and [8].


2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [2].

   General mobility terminology can be found in [9].  The following
   additional terms, as defined in [7], are used in this document:

   Access Service Authorizer (ASA):

      A network operator that authenticates a MN and establishes the
      MN's authorization to receive Internet service.

   Access Service Provider (ASP):

      A network operator that provides direct IP packet forwarding to
      and from the MN.

   Mobility Service Authorizer (MSA):

      A service provider that authorizes MIPv6 service.

   Mobility Service Provider (MSP):

      A service provider that provides MIPv6 service.  In order to
      obtain such service, the MN must be authenticated and authorized
      to obtain the MIPv6 service.

   Split scenario:

      A scenario where the mobility service and the network access
      service are authorized by different entities.

   Integrated Scenario:

      A scenario where the mobility service and the network access
      service are authorized by the same entity.

   Network Access Server (NAS):

      A device that provides an access service for a user to a network.

   Home AAA (HAAA):

      An authentication, authorization and accounting server located in
      user's home network.


3.  Overview

   This document addresses the authentication, authorization and
   accounting functionality required by for the MIPv6 bootstrapping as
   outlined in the MIPv6 bootstrapping problem statement document [7].
   This document focuses on the Diameter based AAA functionality for the
   NAS to HAAA interface.

   In the integrated scenario MIPv6 bootstrapping is provided as part of
   the network access authentication procedure.  Figure 1 shows the
   participating entities.  This document, however, only concentrates on
   the NAS, possible local Diameter proxies and the home Diameter
   server.

      Figure 1: Mobile IPv6 Bootstrapping in the Integrated Scenario

   In a typical MIPv6 access scenario the MN is attached to an ASP's
   network.  During the network attachment procedure, the NAS/Diameter
   client interacts with the MN.

   During the time of authentication the Diameter server in the MSA
   detects that the user is also authorized for MIPv6 access.  Based on
   the MSA's policy, the Diameter server may return several MIPv6
   bootstrapping related parameters.

   Depending on the details of the bootstrapping solution interaction
   with the DHCPv6 server may be required, as described in [10].
   However, the Diameter based NAS to HAAA interface described in this
   document is not tied to DHCPv6 as the only possible MIPv6
   bootstrapping method.

4.  Commands, AVPs and Advertising Application Support

   This section describes command codes, defines AVPs and advertised
   application identifiers for the Diameter MIPv6 bootstrapping in the
   NAS to HAAA interface.

4.1.  Advertising Application Support

   Diameter nodes conforming to this specification MUST include the
   value of 1 (NASREQ application) or 5 (EAP application) in the Auth-
   Application-Id and the Acct-Application-Id AVP of the Capabilities-
   Exchange-Request / Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands [3].

4.2.  Command Codes

   This document re-uses the Diameter NASREQ application [4] and the EAP
   application commands [5].  The following commands are used to carry
   MIPv6 related bootstrapping AVPs:


   Command-Name             Abbrev.   Code     Reference  Application

   Diameter-EAP-Request      DER       268      RFC 4072   EAP
   Diameter-EAP-Answer       DEA       268      RFC 4072   EAP

   AA-Request                AAR       265      RFC 4005   NASREQ
   AA-Answer                 AAA       265      RFC 4005   NASREQ


     Figure 2: MIPv6 Bootstrapping NAS to HAAA Interface Command Codes

   When the Re-Auth-Request (RAR), Re-Auth-Answer (RAA), Session-
   Termination-Request (STR), Session-Termination-Answer (STA), Abort-
   Session-Request (ASR), Abort-Session-Answer (ASA), Accounting-Request
   (ACR), and Accounting-Answer (ACA) commands are used together with
   the MIPv6 bootstrapping NAS to HAAA interface, they follow the rules
   in the Diameter NASREQ [5], EAP [4] and RFC 3588 [3] applications.
   The accounting commands use the Application Identifier value of 3
   (Diameter Base Accounting); the others use 0 (Diameter Common
   Messages).

4.3.  Diameter-EAP-Request (DER)

   The Diameter-EAP-Request (DER) message [4], indicated by the Command-
   Code field set to 268 and the 'R' bit set in the Command Flags field,
   is sent by the NAS to the Diameter server to initiate a network
   access authentication and authorization procedure.  The DER message
   format is the same as defined in [4].  The message MAY include

                              * [ AVP ]

4.4.  Diameter-EAP-Answer (DEA)

   The Diameter-EAP-Answer (DEA) message defined in [4], indicated by
   the Command-Code field set to 268 and 'R' bit cleared in the Command
   Flags field, is sent in response to the Diameter-EAP-Request message
   (DER).  If the network access authentication procedure was successful
   then the response MAY include any set of bootstrapping AVPs.

   The DEA message format is the same as defined in [4] with an addition
   of optional MIPv6 bootstrapping AVPs:

     <Diameter-EAP-Answer> ::= < Diameter Header: 268, PXY >

                      ...
                    * [ AVP ]

4.6.  AA-Answer (AAA)

   The AA-Answer (AAA) message, indicated by the Command-Code field set
   to 265 and 'R' bit cleared in the Command Flags field is sent in
   response to the AA-Request (AAR) message for confirmation of the
   result of MIPv6 HA bootstrapping.  If the network access
   authentication procedure was successful then the response MAY include
   any set of bootstrapping AVPs.

   The AAA message format is the same as defined in [5] with an addition
   of optional MIPv6 bootstrapping AVPs:

     <AA-Answer> ::= < Diameter Header: 265, PXY >
                     < Session-Id >
                     { Auth-Application-Id }

4.7.  Attribute Value Pair Definitions

4.7.1.  Mobility-Agent-Info

   The Mobility-Agent-Info AVP (AVP code TBD) is type of Grouped and
   contains necessary information to assign a HA to the MN.  When the
   Mobility-Agent-Info AVP is present in a message, it MUST contain
   either a MIP6-Home-Agent-Address AVP or a MIP6-Home-Agent-FQDN AVP,
   but not both.  The grouped AVP has the following grammar:

4.7.2.  MIP6-Home-Agent-Address AVP

   The MIP6-Home-Agent-Address AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Address
   (see Section 4.3 in [3]) and contains the HA address.  The Diameter
   server MAY decide to assign a HA to the MN that is in close proximity
   to the point of attachment (e.g., determined by the NAS-Identifier
   AVP).  There may be other reasons for dynamically assigning HAs to
   the MN, for example to share the traffic load.

   This AVP MAY also be attached by the NAS when sent to the Diameter
   server in a request message as a hint of a locally assigned HA
   address.

4.7.3.  MIP6-Home-Agent-FQDN AVP

   The MIP6-Home-Agent-FQDN AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type UTF8String and
   contains the FQDN of a HA.  The usage of this AVP is equivalent to
   the MIP6-Home-Agent-Address AVP but offers an additional level of
   indirection via the DNS infrastructure.

4.7.4.  Mobility-Capability AVP

   The Mobility-Capability AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned64 and
   contains a 64 bits flags field of supported capabilities of the NAS/
   ASP.  Sending and receiving the Mobility-Capability AVP with value 0
   MUST be supported.

   The NAS MAY include this AVP to indicate capabilities of the NAS/ASP
   to the Diameter server.  For example, the NAS may indicate that a
   local home agent can be provided.  Similarly, the Diameter server MAY
   include this AVP to inform the NAS/ASP about which of the NAS/ASP
   indicated capabilities are supported or authorized by the ASA/MSA(/
   MSP).

   The following capabilities are defined in this document:

   MOBILITY_CAPABILITY (0x0000000000000000)

      The Mobility-Capability AVP MAY contain value 0 (zero) with the
      semantics that are defined in this document for the Mobile IPv6
      bootstrapping functionality.  This 'zero' flag is always
      implicitly set when the Mobility-Capability AVP is used.

   LOCAL_HOME_AGENT_ASSIGNMENT (0x0000000000000001)

      This flag is set by the NAS/ASP when a local home agent can be
      assigned to the MN.  This flag is set by the ASA/MSA(/MSP) when
      the use of a local HA is authorized.


5.  Example Message Flows

5.1.  EAP-based Authentication

   This section shows basic message flows of MIPv6 integrated scenario
   bootstrapping and dynamic HA assignment.  In Figure 3 network access
   authentication is based on EAP (e.g., 802.11i/802.1X).  The NAS
   informs the home Diameter server that it wishes to provide a locally
   assigned HA to the visiting MN.  The Diameter server assigns the MN a
   HA in the home MSP but also authorizes the assignment of local HA for
   the ASP.  The Diameter server then replies to the NAS with HA related
   bootstrapping information.  Whether the NAS/ASP then offers a locally
   assigned HA or the MSP assigned HA to the MN is based on the local
   ASP policy.

5.2.  Integrated Scenario and HA Allocation in MSP

   Diameter is used to authenticate and authorize the MN for the
   mobility service, and to send information about the allocated HA to
   the NAS.  In this example scenario the MN uses DHCP for its IP
   address configuration.

      Figure 4: Mobile IPv6 Integrated Scenario Bootstrapping and the
             allocation of HAs either in the ASP or in the MSP

   1) The MN executes the normal network access authentication procedure
      (IEEE 802.11i/802.1X, PANA, ...) with the NAS.  The NAS acts as an
      authenticator in "pass-through" mode.  The other endpoint of the
      authentication dialogue is the MN's home Diameter server.  This is
      a typical scenario for network access authentication using EAP
      methods.  The NAS includes at least one of the NAS to HAAA
      interface AVPs in the DER or in the AAR messages to indicate MIPv6
      bootstrapping capability.  For example, the NAS could include the
      Mobility-Capability AVP with a value 0.

   2) Depending on the Diameter server configuration and the user's
      subscription profile, the Mobility-Agent-Info AVP and/or the
      Mobility-Capability AVP may be carried in the DEA, assuming the
      home Diameter server has allocated a HA to the MN.  In case the
      MIP6-Home-Agent-FQDN AVP was returned within the Mobility-Agent-
      Info grouped AVP the MN ultimately needs to perform a DNS query in
      order to discover the HA's IP address.  For example, the home

Internet-Draft   Diameter MIPv6 NAS to HAAA Interaction         May 2007


      Diameter server could return the following AVPs:

      o  Mobility-Agent-Info grouped AVP containing:
         *  MIP6-Home-Agent-Address = 2001:db8:6000:302::1/64
         *  MIP6-Home-Agent-FQDN = ha.example.com

   3) the MN sends a DHCPv6 Information Request message to
      all_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers address.  In the OPTION_ORO,
      Option Code for the Home Network Identifier Option shall be
      included in that message [10].  The Home Network Identifier Option
      should have id-type of 1, the message is a request to discover
      home network information that pertains to the given realm, i.e.,
      the user's home domain (identified by the NAI of the MN).  The
      OPTION_CLIENTID is set by the MN to identify itself to the DHCP
      server.

   Steps 4 to 6 are not relevant from the NAS to HAAA Diameter interface
   point of view and are not described in this document.  The reader
   should consult [10] for a detailed description about the rest of the
   integrated scenario bootstrapping procedure.

5.3.  Integrated Scenario and HA Allocation in ASP

   This scenario is similar to the one described in Section 5.2 and
   illustrated in Figure 4.  There are slight differences in steps 2)
   and 3).

   2) The NAS/ASP wishes to allocate a local HA to the visiting MN.  The
      NAS/ASP will also inform the Diameter server about the HA address
      it has assigned to the visiting MN (e.g., 2001:db8:1:c020::1).  In
      this case the NAS includes the following AVPs in the DER or in the
      AAR messages:

      o  Mobility-Capability = LOCAL_HOME_AGENT_ASSIGNMENT
      o  Mobility-Agent-Info grouped AVP containing:
         *  MIP6-Home-Agent-Address = 2001:db8:1:c020::1

      Depending on the Diameter server configuration and user's
      subscription profile, the Diameter server either accepts or
      rejects the proposal of locally allocated HA in the NAS/ASP.  If
      the Diameter server accepts the proposal then the Mobility-
      Capability AVP with LOCAL_HOME_AGENT_ASSIGNMENT bit set is
      returned back to the NAS.  On the other hand if the Diameter
      server does not accept locally assigned HA, the Diameter returns
      the Mobility-Capability AVP with LOCAL_HOME_AGENT_ASSIGNMENT bit
      unset.  The Diameter server assigns a HA to the MN (e.g., 2001:
      db8:6000::1) in the ASA/MSA/(MSP) and returns the IP address back
      to the NAS/ASP.  In a case the home Diameter server accepted the

Internet-Draft   Diameter MIPv6 NAS to HAAA Interaction         May 2007


      NAS/ASP proposal of local HA the home Diameter server would
      return, for example, the following AVPs:

      o  Mobility-Capability = LOCAL_HOME_AGENT_ASSIGNMENT
      o  Mobility-Agent-Info grouped AVP containing:
         *  MIP6-Home-Agent-Address = 2001:db8:6000::1

   3) The type-id field in the Home Network Identifier Option is set to
      zero, indicating that a HA is requested in the ASP instead of in
      the MSP.  Depending on the result of the phase 2) the DHCP relay
      agent places in the OPTION_MIP6-RELAY-Option either the locally
      allocated HA information or the HA information that was returned
      (proposed) by home Diameter server.  The selection of local or
      home allocated HAs in based on the local policy in the ASP.  It is
      also possible that both local and home allocated HAs are available
      for the MN.  The policy and heuristics when to select the local HA
      and when the home HA are outside of this specification.

   Following the policies outlined in [1] new values with a description
   of their semantic for usage with the Mobility-Capability AVP together
   with a Token will be assigned after Expert Review initiated by the
   O&M Area Directors in consultation with the DIME working group chairs
   or the working group chairs of a designated successor working group.
   Updates can be provided based on expert approval only.  A designated
   expert will be appointed by the O&M Area Directors.  No mechanism to
   mark entries as "deprecated" is envisioned.  Based on expert approval
   it is possible to delete entries from the registry.


9.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the Diameter interaction required to
   accomplish the integrated scenario are described in [10].
   Additionally, the security considerations of the Diameter base
   protocol [3], Diameter NASREQ application [5] / Diameter EAP [4]
   application (with respect to network access authentication and the
   transport of keying material) are applicable to this document.  This
   document does not introduce new security vulnerabilities.
