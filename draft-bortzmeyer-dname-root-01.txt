     Using DNAME in the root for the delegation of special-use TLDs
                     draft-bortzmeyer-dname-root-01

Abstract

   This documents asks IANA to add DNAME records in the DNS root for
   TLDs which are in the Special-Use Domain Names registry, in order to
   ensure they receive an appropriate reply (NXDOMAIN) and that the root
   is not too bothered by them.

   REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: there is no obvious place to discuss this
   document.  May be the IETF DNSOP (DNS Operations) group, through its
   mailing list (the author reads it).  Or may AS112 operators mailing
   lists?  The source of the document, as well as a list of open issues,
   is currently kept at Github [1].

1.  Introduction and background

   The DNS root receives a lot of requests for TLDs which do not exist.
   See for instance [fujiwara-root-traffic] or [icann-l-root-stats] or
   [ssac-045].  In the spirit of [RFC7534], it would be good if they
   could be redirected to a sink such as AS112, to save root's
   resources.

   Some of these names, and specially one of the biggest offenders,
   .local ([RFC6762]), are registered in the Special-Use Domain Names
   registry [2] of [RFC6761].  They are obvious candidates for a
   delegation to the sink.

   It is proposed to use the new AS112, the one described by [RFC7535]
   to implement this sink.

   TODO: results of the discussion with AS112 people

1.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft                DNAME in root                   April 2016


2.  Rules

   Every TLD ([RFC7719], section 2) which is in the Special-Use Domain
   Names registry [3] ([RFC6761]) SHOULD be delegated by IANA through a
   DNAME to empty.as112.arpa as described in [RFC7535] if and only if
   the registration of this TLD say that resolvers should not or must
   not look them up in the DNS.

   It is important to notice that this document does not define a policy
   to decide if a TLD should be "delegated" or not.  Instead, it relies
   on the existing Special-Use Domain Names registry and its rules.

   RFC-EDITOR: remove before publication.  As of today, with these
   rules, .local ([RFC6762]) or .onion ([RFC7686]) would be delegated
   but not .example (its registration in [RFC6761] does not define
   special handling for resolvers) or .home or .belkin (this last one
   generates a huge traffic at the root but is not in the Special-Use
   Domain Names registry).

3.  Benefits

   The main benefit is less load on the root and a better efficiency of
   the caches, therefore helping the entire DNS ecosystem.

4.  Possible issues

   Of course, the solution described in this document requires a good
   support of DNAME by the resolvers.  Appendix A of [RFC7535] describes
   an experiment which was run in 2013 and which shows that, indeed, we
   can rely on DNAME (quoting the authors: "We conclude that there is no
   evidence of a consistent failure on the part of deployed DNS
   resolvers to correctly resolve a DNAME construct.").

   Regarding DNSSEC, do note the future DNAMEs in the root will be
   signed, but the target, empty.as112.arpa, is not.  See George
   Michaelson's message [4].  So, it will not be possible to validate
   the answers.  Not a problem since these requests should never have
   been sent to the root, anyway.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested (TODO what is the appropriate wording?) to add a
   DNAME in the root for every TLD which fits the rules of Section 2.

   RFC-EDITOR: remove before publication.  There is currently no DNAME
   in the root.  It is expected that the creation of the first one will
   require a top-down, multi-stakeholder, long and complicated process
   with a lot of meetings, reports by consultants and design teams.

6.  Security Considerations

   The requests for the TLD in the Special-Use Domain Names registry are
   typically NOT supposed to leak to the authoritative public name
   servers such as the ones of the root.  If they do, it means a
   misconfiguration somewhere.  The leak is independant on whether the
   name is delegated to AS112 or not.  See section 8 of [RFC7534] for an
   analysis.  Some people believe there are added risks, because the
   queries will be seen by AS112 servers which, unlike the root, are
   managed by many "random people".

7.  Acknowledgments

   Thanks to Paul Hoffman to say that it may be a good idea and for Ted
   Lemon to give the final impulse, with his [I-D.tldr-sutld-ps].
