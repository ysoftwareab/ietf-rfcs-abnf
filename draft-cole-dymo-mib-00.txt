1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of the
   Dynamic MANET On-demand (DYMO) routing [I-D:ietf-manet-dymo] process
   on a router.  The DYMO MIB also reports state information, i.e.,
   Routing Information Base (RIB) entries, performance metrics, i.e.,
   counter of the number Routing Messages, and notifications.  In
   addition to configuration, this additional state and performance
   information is useful to management stations troubleshooting routing
   problems.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The DYMO routing protocol allows routers in a Mobile Ad-Hoc network
   (MANET) setting to discover forwarding paths through the network.
   The DYMO routing protocol is an On-Demand protocol in the sense that
   it only discovers paths when there is end system data traffic to
   transmit.  When a Source Node (SN) has traffic to send to a Target
   Node (TN), the SN floods the MANET with a route_request (RREQ)
   message containing the SN and TN addresses.  Intermediate Nodes (IN)
   rebroadcast the RREQ message, appending path information as the
   message propagates throughout the MANET.  When the RREQ message
   reaches the TN, it replies with a route_reply (RREP) message to the
   SN.  Once the SN receives the RREP message from the TN, path
   information in the form of path entries in the Source, Intermediate

   and Target nodes' Routing Information Base (RIB) is embedded and
   affords packet forwarding of the data packets.  Further, off-path
   forwarding information towards the SN is embedded as the RREQ
   messages propagate throughout the MANET.

   As nodes move about, links to next hop nodes along routing paths will
   break.  In this case intermediate nodes can issue route_error (RERR)
   messages to notify nodes relying on the broken forwarding path to
   discover new paths.  Hence, DYMO nodes are required to monitor the
   availability of next hop links being used in forwarding paths.  This
   may be accomplished via the Next Hop Discovery Protocol (NHDP) [I-D:
   ietf-manet-nhdp].

   Routers can be configured to run the DYMO routing protocol over all
   or a subset of local interfaces.  Further, DYMO routers can be
   configured to trigger RREP messages based upon receiving any data
   destine to all unknown TN addresses or only to a subset of addresses.
   DYMO routers can act as proxy, gateway nodes between DYMO routing
   domains and non-DYMO routing domains.  Finally, the DYMO protocol
   process can be tuned through a set of configurable settings.  Hence,
   DYMO routers are configured to maintain:

   o  A list of potential DYMO target addresses for route discovery,

   o  A list of DYMO-enabled local interfaces,

   o  A list of addresses to act as a proxy gateway, and

   o  A set of configurable parameters, e.g., timers, to tune the
      performance of the routing protocol.

   Once in operation, the DYMO routers will maintain a set of state
   information, which is temporal in nature.  E.g., to prevent the
   creation of routing loops, DYMO routers maintain, increment and
   append sequence numbers to Routing Messages (RMs).  The current
   router sequence number is an example of local state information.
   Further, as the router discovers and overhears path information to
   various TNs in the MANET, the DYMO router populates this knowledge in
   it's local Routing Information Base (RIP).  Entries in the RIB tell
   the local routing the next hop and interface to forward data packets
   destine for a given TN.  The DYMO routers are responsible for
   tracking the availability of the next hop links which are registered
   in their RIB.  Hence, DYMO routers dynamically maintain a set of
   state objects, including:

   o

   Routing in a MANET is a tricky endeavor.  The DYMO routing process

Internet-Draft                The DYMO MIB                 February 2008


   contains numerous configurable parameters which impact the overall
   performance of the MANET.  Hence, the DYMO MIB defines a set of
   Performance and Notification objects to aid network administrators to
   track the overall health of the routing process and to aid in fault
   isolation and correction of routing related problems.

4.1.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB.

   o  Tunable Configuration Objects - objects whose values affect timing
      or attempt bounds on the DYMO protocol.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values which define the
      current operating state of the DYMO protocol process in the
      router.

   o  Performance Objects - automatically generated values which help an
      administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the
      DYMO protocol process on the router and the overall routing
      performance within the DYMO routing domain.

4.2.  Organization

   This document is organized as ...

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the DYMO MIB module.  The
   objects are arranged into the following groups:

   o  General Information Group - ...

   o  Configuration Group - ...

   o  State Group - ...

   o  Performance Group - ...

   o  Notification Group - ...

   Protocol Tuning Configuration Parameters:

   o  MAX_HOPLIMIT - 10 hops ([I-D:ietf-manet-dymo], sect. 5.3.1)

   o  BUFFER_SIZE_PACKETS, 50 packets

   o  BUFFER_SIZE, 1500 * BUFFER_SIZE_PACKETS

   o  PACKET_RATE_THROTTLE - ([I-D:ietf-manet-dymo], sect. 5.9)

   Timer Configuration - ([I-D:ietf-manet-dymo], sect. 5.2.3):

   o  ROUTE_TIMEOUT - 5 seconds ([I-D:ietf-manet-dymo], sect. 6)

   o  NET_TRANSVERSAL_TIME - 1000 msec ([I-D:ietf-manet-dymo], sect. 6)

   o  ROUTE_DELETE_TIMEOUT - 2*ROUTE_TIMEOUT

   o  UNICAST_MESSAGE_SENT_TIMEOUT - 1 sec ([I-D:ietf-manet-dymo], sect.
      6)

   Configuration Tables:

   o  LocalHosts - If RESPONSIBLE_ADDRESSES is set to other than self
      address, then the DYMO router must be configured with the set of
      local host addresses for which it is to generate RREP messages.

   o  TargetAddresses - If RREP_GENERATION is set to other than all,
      then the DYMO router must be configured with a set of addresses
      for which it is to generate RREQ messages.

   o  DymoInterfaces - If DYMO_INTERFACES is set to other than all, then
      the DYMO router must be told which interfaces to run the DYMO
      protocol over.  ([I-D:ietf-manet-dymo], sect. 5.9).  This would be
      a table containing the interfaces and associated information.

Internet-Draft                The DYMO MIB                 February 2008


   o  GatewayResponsibleAddresses - If IS_GATEWAY is set, then the DYMO
      router requires Dymo-gateway configuration parameters, e.g.,
      addresses to proxy RM ([I-D:ietf-manet-dymo], sect. 5.8).  This
      would be a table containing the addresses and associated
      information.

5.4.  The State Group

   The State Subtree reports current state information, including
   forwarding tables.  State information falls into 'General', 'Routing
   Information Base (RIB)', and 'Current Neighbors Table'.  These are
   separately discussed below.

   (Note: these will serve as the object descriptions once they are
   discussed and refined.)

5.4.1.  General State Information

   General state information could include:

   o  DYMO Version Number -

   o  Current Sequence Number - ([I-D:ietf-manet-dymo], sect. 3)

5.4.2.  Routing Information Base

   The Routing Information Base (RIB) - ([I-D:ietf-manet-dymo], sect.
   4.1), includes table entries with the following mandatory objects,
   i.e.,

   o  Route.Address

   o  Route.SeqNum

   o  Route.NextHopAddress

   o  Route.NextHopInterface

   o  Route.Broken

   and the following optional objects, i.e.,

   o  Route.Distance

   o  Route.Prefix

   One consideration is how to handle RREQ which are in progress.  The
   DYMO-MIB may want to populate a row in the RIB with the target

   address and have an indication that a RREQ is pending.  Another
   option is to have a separate table containing pending information.

5.4.3.  Current NextHop Table

   The current nexthop table - ([I-D:ietf-manet-dymo], sect. 5.5.1),
   includes a table of active (i.e., currently found as Next Hop
   addresses in the router's RIB) links to neighbors.  This table could
   be populated by various means, including the use of the NHDP [I-D:
   ietf-manet-nhdp].

5.5.  The Performance Group

   Reports values relevant to system performance.  These will serve as
   the object descriptions once they are discussed and refined.)

   Not sure this is something that would be useful to network managers.
   But it may be useful to have a set of performance related counters
   available through the DYMO-MIB.  These could also be potentially
   useful in conjunction with traps or informs.

   One set of potential performance counters can be derived from the
   various configuration limits and timeout values.  These performance
   counters would register the number of faults related to these
   configurable parameters.  These would potentially aid in parameter
   tuning and routing protocol optimization.

   Another specific example would be the number of data packets awaiting
   a route, or a counter indicating the number of buffer overflows, etc.

   Another set, is the initial set of performance parameters written
   into this version of the DYMO-MIB draft are counters related to the
   number of RMs, RREQs, RREPs, and RERR messages.  We could expose only
   aggregate information in the form of counters as shown below.  Or
   could build tables indexed by InetAddress of targets.

5.6.  The Notifications Group

   The Notifications Subtree contains the list of notifications
   supported within the DYMO-MIB and their intended purpose or utility.
   What would be a potential list of notifications for the DYMO-MIB,
   e.g.,

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   [TODO]: The text of this section specifies the relationship of the
   MIB modules contained in this document to other standards,
   particularly to standards containing other MIB modules.  Definitions
   imported from other MIB modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be
   implemented in conjunction with the MIB module contained within this
   document are identified in this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The DYMO-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   [TODO] This section is included as an example; If the MIB module is
   not an adjunct of the Interface MIB, then this section should be
   removed.

6.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   [TODO]: Citations are not permitted within a MIB module, but any
   module mentioned in an IMPORTS clause or document mentioned in a
   REFERENCE clause is a Normative reference, and must be cited
   someplace within the narrative sections.  If there are imported items
   in the MIB module, such as Textual Conventions, that are not already
   cited, they can be cited in text here.  Since relationships to other
   MIB modules should be described in the narrative text, this section
   is typically used to cite modules from which Textual Conventions are
   imported.

   The following DYMO-MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], and IF-MIB
   [RFC2863]

8.  Security Considerations

   [TODO] Each specification that defines one or more MIB modules MUST
   contain a section that discusses security considerations relevant to
   those modules.  This section MUST be patterned after the latest
   approved template (available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html).  Remember that the
   objective is not to blindly copy text from the template, but rather
   to think and evaluate the risks/vulnerabilities and then state/
   document the result of this evaluation.

   [TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-create objects, please
   include the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] writeable MIB objects that could be especially disruptive
      if abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the associated
      security risks MUST be spelled out; RFC 2669 has a very good
      example.

   o  [TODO] list the writable tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] else if there are no read-write objects in your MIB module,
   use the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   [TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include the
   following boilerplate paragraph.

Internet-Draft                The DYMO MIB                 February 2008


   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] you must explicitly list by name any readable objects that
      are sensitive or vulnerable and the associated security risks MUST
      be spelled out (for instance, if they might reveal customer
      information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
      European Union if exposed to unathorized parties)

   o  [TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the
   information should have.  The following three boilerplate paragraphs
   should not be changed without very good reason.  Changes will almost
   certainly require justification during IESG review.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   [TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
   http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
   submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
   Considerations section.  The requirements for this section vary
   depending what actions are required of the IANA. see RFC4181 section

Internet-Draft                The DYMO MIB                 February 2008


   3.5 for more information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module
   document.

   [TODO] select an option and provide the necessary details.

   Option #1:


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
   MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in a draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

10.  Contributors

   This MIB document uses the template authored by D. Harrington which
   is based on contributions from the MIb Doctors, especially Juergen
   Schoenwaelder, Dave Perkins, C.M.Heard and Randy Presuhn.

   Not applicable to draft 00

   1.

Appendix B.  Open Issues

   This section contains the set of open issues related to the
   development and design of the DYMO-MIB.  This section will not be
   present in the final version of the MIB and will be removed once all
   the open issues have been resolved.

   1.   Agree on set of configuration options to be supported, e.g.,
        Gateway config, local hosts, responsible addresses, etc.

   2.   Will DYMO require an InstanceID for running multiple, concurrent
        DYMO domains within a single router?

   3.   Is support for addresses-less interfaces required?

        objects, but not sensitive objects (true?).

   10.  Work on the relationship to other MIBs, IF-MIB, NHDP-MIB.

   11.  Identify all objects requiring non-volatile storage in their
        DESCRIPTION clauses.

   12.  Incorporate parameter relationship conditions into their
        DESCRIPTION clauses.

   13.  Work up a better management model in the textual description of
        the DYMO-MIB.  Perhaps include management usecases.

   14.  Cleanup all the [TODOs] from the MIB template.
