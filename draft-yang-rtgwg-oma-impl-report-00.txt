2.  Terminology

   o  Reverse Shortest Path First Tree (RSPF Tree): A directed acyclic
      graph containing all the shortest path from the node of the
      network toward the root.

   o  Link L: An edge in the network connecting node a to b will shut
      down and its metric value is K when link L is up.

   o  X set: A node set contains the node impacted by the removal of a
      link L such that each node in X set must change its forwarding
      paths to avoid link L.

   o  Y set: A node set contains all destination nodes in that may be
      concerned by the down event of the link L.

   o  D(Yj,Xi): The shortest distacnce from node Xi to Yj when link L is
      up.

   o  D'(Yj,Xi): The shortest distacnce from node Xi to Yj when link L
      is down.

   o  COST(Yj,Xi,max): If node Xi switches its optimal path to Yj, the
      reasonable upper metric of link L can be adjusted is
      COST(Yj,Xi,max),COST(Yj,Xi,max) = MIN(COST(Yj,Xk,min)),where Xk is
      the father of node Xi in case of link L being up.

   o  COST(Yj,Xi,min): If node Xi switches its optimal path to Yj, the
      reasonable lower metric of link L can be adjusted is
      COST(Yj,Xi,min), COST(Yj,Xi,min) = D'(Yj,Xi)- D(Yj,Xi) + K.

   o  R = (R_min,R_max): Here R_min equals COST(Yj,Xi,min) and R_max =
      COST(Yj,Xi,min).  When the link L!_s metric is set in the range of
      (R_min, R_max), node Xi can be switched to its optimal path to Yj
      without forwarding loop.

   o  Seq(Yj): A metric range sequence for Yj contains all metric ranges
      of source nodes Xi affected by the removal of a link L.When link
      L' s metric set to a value in each metric range of sequence
      Seq(Yj) in order, each node Xi will to its optimal path to Yj
      without forwarding loop.

3.  Overview of Algorithm

   The Internet is the most popular network, which is a distributed
   system.  Depend on its configuration, each network device
   communicates with its neighbor, calculate routes and generate the FIB
   individually, finally, the packet will be forwarded hop by hop.  But

   due to the difference of each device hardware capabilities and
   internal/external environments, the route calculation cannot be
   scheduled at same time, then micro-loop occur.

   In draft [I-D.zxd-rtgwg-ordered-metric-adjustment] we introduces a
   method to prevent forwarding loop by adjusting link metric gradually
   for several times.  In this section we will give an overview of
   algorithm and here we just talk about link down event and results
   computed in down event are also appropriate to link up event.  We
   suppose link L connecting node A to B referenced in the following
   sections will shut down.

   First of all, we have some definitions.  Set X consist of Xi which on
   sub-tree below A in RSPF tree with root B such that each node in X
   must change its forwarding paths to Yj to avoid link L.  And the
   notation Y that gives the set of "affected destinations".  This set
   contains all destination nodes that may be concerned by the change of
   the link L and set Y consist of Yj which on sub- tree below B in RSPF
   tree with root A.  In Figure 1, we have X = {A, C, F, G, H} and Y=
   {B, D, E}

3.1.  Calculating the adjustment range of link metric for each node

   This part is used to calculate a reasonable adjustment metric range
   for each node Xi to switch its optimal path to a destination Yj
   without forwarding loop.  Each metric range of Xi related to Yj make
   up of a metric range sequence for Yj.

   For destination Yj, we calculate the RSPF tree with root Yj when link
   L is up and down to determine the values of two variables R_min =
   COST(Yj,Xi,min) and R_max = COST(Yj,Xi,max).  When the link L's

   metric is set in the range of (R_min,R_max), node Xi can switch to
   its optimal path to the root node Yj without forwarding loop.

   Then metric ranges of Xi computed above make up of a metric range
   sequence for Yj recorded as Seq(Yj).  Then the metric of link L can
   be set to a value in each range of sequence in order .For example, in
   figure 1, we have seq(B) ={[100,120],[80,100],[60,80]} and if we set
   the metric of link L to 60, 81 and 101, each node Xi will switch to
   its optimal path to the B without forwarding loop.

3.2.  Merge different Seq(Yj) into a global sequence

   According to section 1.1, we have different metric range sequence
   corresponding to each destination Yj.  However, nodes need to react
   to the change of a link weight for all affected destinations.  This
   part will show how to merge different sequences of each destination
   into a minimal sequence effectively, then multiple nodes in set X
   simultaneously switch optimal path to each root node without
   forwarding loop.

   Compare the metric range of each Seq(Yj) and choose range R =
   (R_min,R_max) with largest lower bound in these metric ranges.  Then
   remove the metric range with upper bound larger than the lower bound
   R_min of R in all sequence.  Repeat operation above when the sequence
   of all destination is empty, then algorithm terminates.

   When the algorithm finishes, remaining metric ranges
   (R_1min,R_1max),(R_2min,R_2max),... (R_nmin,R_nmax) are what we want.
   In case of link L going to up, the adjustment process of metric of
   link L can be set to R_1min+1,R_2min+1,... ,R_nmin, and configuration
   value K.  In case of link L going to down, the adjustment process of
   metric of link L can be set to configuration value K,
   R_nmin+1,R_((n-1)min)+1,... , and R_1min.

   In figure 1, In case of link L going to down, the adjustment process
   of metric of link L can be set to {10,41,61,81,101}, in proper order,
   then there is no forwarding loop during this adjustment.

4.  Innovation point of algorithm

   There are several different algorithms solving forwarding loops by
   adjusting link metric gradually.  Compared with other solution, we
   put forward two innovation points in each part of our algorithm.

   First innovation point of our algorithm is to check whether
   destination Yj is affected actually due to the down link.  In part 1
   of algorithm, if the size of set Y is |Y|, we need to compute 2|Y|
   times RSPF tree and its complexity is in |N|log|N|+|E| per times in



Yang, et al.              Expires May 28, 2016                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          OMA Implementation Report          November 2015


   the best case.  We just compute an RSPF tree when link L is up
   firstly.  According to the Dynamic Dijsktra Algorithm, we know that
   nodes only on sub- tree below A in RSPF tree with root Yj will change
   its optimal paths to destination if link L change.  Obviously, if it
   is empty on sub- tree below A in RSPF tree with root Yj, only node A
   will change its optimal path to root so that no forwarding loop for
   destination Yj can occur when link L down.  We call it "Unaffected
   destination" and in this case we can delete destination Yj from the
   set Y.  If there are |m| destinations are unaffected, we just need |
   2|Y|-|m|| times computation.

   The second innovation of our algorithm is that using metric range
   express the reasonable adjustment metric range for each node to
   change their optimal path to the root node and using a common range
   instead of several overlapping ranges to reduce the operation.  In
   part 2 of algorithm, we merge different range sequences into a global
   sequence, however, many ranges overlap with each other so if merge
   overlapping ranges into a common range, adjusting link metric several
   times can be instead of one time.  Like this we can reduce a large
   number of metric ranges in a reasonably short time and the final
   global sequence will include a few ranges.

   Through these two points, we have a minimal metric sequence length
   with the fastest computing time among the similar algorithms.

5.  Simulation of Algorithm

   This section aims at evaluating the performance of our algorithm from
   two aspects: sequence length and the time required to compute them on
   real IP networks.  Firstly, we present the topologies we used in our
   algorithms.  Then present the results of our simulation, analyzing
   the reasonable length, as well as the efficiency of our optimizations
   on computing times.

5.1.  Environment Setup

   Table I summarizes the main characteristics of our simulation
   topologies. |N| and |E| respectively represent the number of nodes
   and links in the graph. d_m is the maximum degree, and &#969; gives
   the weight distribution.  Networks 1-6 of Table I are Rocketfuel
   inferred topologies obtained with traceroute campaigns
   [inferring-link-weight-e2e].  Networks 7-10 are generated obey power-
   law distribution.  Networks 9 and 10 are topologies with special
   shape.  Network 9 is a star topology and network 10 is a circle
   consists of several small circles.  Networks 4 and 5 come with
   inferred IGP weights and other topologies come with random weights in
   [1,100].

5.2.  Measurement and Methods

   In the results of simulation we focus on the length of metric
   sequence and computing time.  The shortest sequence length, the less
   operation will we do.  Thus we expect to get a minimal sequence and
   computing time is as short as possible.

   Firstly we have a loop-risk test on all simulation networks.  We
   carry on 1000 times tests on each network making a link fail
   randomly, recording the total number that we need to use our
   algorithm to reconfigure fail link.  This test will show that in most
   topologies the risk of loop will occur frequently when a link fail.
   So it is very important to search an efficient algorithm to prevent
   micro-loop.

   Then we carry on |E| times tests in each network mentioned above
   ensuring that every link in topology will fail once, recording the
   sequence length and computing time each time and analysis it.

5.3.1.  Micro-loop risk

   Table 2 shows that possibility of micro-loop occurrence is more 50%
   in most topology.  So it is very important to search an efficient
   algorithm to prevent forwarding loop.

5.3.2.  Sequence length and computing time

   Tables 2 and 3 respectively give an overview of metric sequence
   length and computing time observed on our set of simulation networks.

   Minimal Metric Sequence Length: The length of the sequence we
   obtained in most cases are relatively short.  The actual network
   topology of 1-4,6 and 11, for more than half of the cases, no
   intermediate metric is needed, as the size of the sequence is equal
   to 0 and more than 90% of the cases, less than two intermediate
   metrics are needed to ensure a loop-free convergence in case of a
   link removal.  For all networks, in most case approximately less than
   ten intermediate metrics can solve micro-loop during the convergence.

   For all networks, there are several factors which influence the
   length of the metric sequence: 1) network size: Apparently when the
   size becomes larger, the number of source and destination nodes
   significantly increased, so more intermediate state are needed.  In
   our simulation, network 10 is the biggest which has 500 nodes and
   2000 links and we can notice that it need more intermediate state
   than others. 2) network shape: a ring network is easy to form a deep
   , so there can be many nodes on the ring forward its packets along
   the same direction to destination.  When an upstream link is closed,
   if all these nodes go backward to avoid a failed link, it will
   produce a number of cycles, as the length of the sequence is longer
   than others certainly.  Results of network 12 prove it. 3) weight
   distribution: When a network with a large weight range, there may be



Yang, et al.              Expires May 28, 2016                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          OMA Implementation Report          November 2015


   less overlap range.  So the common range remained will be more thus
   we get a longer sequence such as network 5.

   Although in a few cases the length of metric sequence is a little
   long, but most of our sequence have a very reasonable size.

   Computing Time: We will show that compared with others, our algorithm
   has the shortest computing time.  Here we focus on a similar
   algorithm [lightweight-algorithm-minimal-operation-impact] (We call
   it to "Graceful" for short in the following content) and give a
   contrast between them.  Table III gives computing time percentiles
   including worst-cases results.

   According to the statistical, for all networks except network 10, the
   maximum computation time for calculating a sequence is below a few
   hundred milliseconds.  Compared with the Graceful algorithm, there is
   no significant difference when network size is small.  However, with
   network size increasing our algorithm performs better significantly
   which can be completed in a shorter time.  That is because two
   innovative points in our algorithm.  It can reduce the computation
   time effectively.

6.  Conclusion

   In document [I-D.zxd-rtgwg-ordered-metric-adjustment] we introduces a
   method to prevent forwarding loop by adjusting link metric gradually
   for several times.  In this document we mainly give the simulation
   data.  We have a simple review firstly then focus on the innovation
   in our algorithm.  Then give the simulation results such that our
   algorithm have the best performance among the current mainstream
   algorithms to prevent forwarding loop.
