1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

  For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
  Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
  RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. Managed objects are accessed via a virtual 
  information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  
  MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network 
  Management Protocol (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
  mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI). 
  This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, 
  which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 
  [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 

2. Terms 

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 
  [RFC2119]. 

3. Overview 

  This memo defines a registry of the IPPM working group metrics. It 
  assigns an OBJECT IDENTIFIER to each metric currently standardized by 
  the IPPM WG. It defines the rules for the identification of the 
  metrics standardized in the future. 

4. The IPPM Framework 

  The IPPM Framework consists in four major components:

      + A general framework for defining performance metrics 
        described in the Framework for IP Performance Metrics RFC2330 
        [RFC 2330]; 

      + A set of standardized metrics, which conform to this 
        framework. 

      + Emerging metrics which are being specified in respect of this 
        framework;

Internet Draft           IPPM metrics registry              January 2004


      + The IPPM-REPORTING-MIB for reporting the results of the 
        measures and for interfacing heterogeneous measurement systems
        with management entities. 


5. Overview 

  This memo defines a registry of the current metrics and a framework 
  for the integration of future metrics for the following reasons: 

      + to permit metrics to be clearly referenced by MIBs or other data
        models; 

      + Metrics identifiers are needed to allow measurement 
        interoperability; 

      + As specification of new metrics is a continuous process, special
        care must be taken for the integration of future standardized
        metrics; 

      + As the intent of the IPPM WG is to cooperate with other 
        appropriate standards bodies and other areas of IETF to promote
        consistent metrics, there is a need to permit registration of 
        such metrics. 


6. IPPM metrics Registry framework 

  MIBs need OBJECT INDENTIFIERs to refer precisely to the standardized 
  metrics. The registry associates an OBJECT IDENTIFIER with each 
  metric. As an example oneWayDelay and oneWayDelayPoissonStream have 
  different identifiers. 

  The registry has 2 root branches. The category of the document 
  determines the node which branch the metric is identified in: 

      + Metrics defined in a RFC are identified in the 'rfc' tree; 
      + Metrics defined in cooperation with other bodies may be 
        identified in the 'otherBodies' tree. 

  The name of the metric in the registry must respect the SMIv2 rules 
  for descriptors ([RFC2578], section 3.1) and should be easily 
  readable. Consequently the following is applied to adapt the name 
  used in the metric definition: 

      + The first letter is forced to lower case; 
      + '-' are removed; 
      + The letter following a '-' is forced to upper case; 
      + 'Type-P' prefix is removed.

Internet Draft           IPPM metrics registry              January 2004


  This document defines an initial registry of the existing metrics. 
  Documents defining metrics in the future will include a registry 
  section to clearly identify these metrics.  


6.1. Metrics registry template 

  Each memo includes a registry which identifies the metrics. The 
  registry is defined using a MODULE-IDENTITY macro. The name of the 
  module must be unique. Each metric is identified in the registry 
  using an OBJECT-IDENTITY macro defining the metric name, status, 
  reference and OBJECT IDENTIFIER.  

  The registry is defined in a dedicated section of the memo. 

  As an example, consider an improbable IPPM WG draft that defines 4 
  metrics in the sections 4, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively: 

      + Type-P-Packet-Speed metric; 
      + Type-P-Average-Packet-Speed metric; 
      + Type-P-Minimum-Packet-Speed metric; 
      + Type-P-Maximum-Packet-Speed metric. 

  Following is the registry that may be included in the document:

      + The name of the section is 'IPPM Packet Speed metrics registry';
      + The name of the module is ippmPacketSpeedMetricsRegistry; 
      + 'N' is the node assigned by IANA to the registry module; 
      + The next free node of the sub tree ippmMetricsRegistry.rfc(1) is
        '34'.

6.2. Initial IPPM metrics registry creation

Internet Draft           IPPM metrics registry              January 2004


  The initial registry identifies the metrics currently defined in the 
  RFCs produced in the IPPM WG. 

  By now, the IPPM WG defined 33 metrics related to 7 topics: 

      + IPPM Metrics for Measuring Connectivity, RFC 2678 [RFC2678]; 
      + One-way Delay Metrics, RFC 2679  [RFC2679]; 
      + One-way Packet Loss Metrics, RFC 2680 [RFC2680]; 
      + Round-trip Delay Metrics, RFC 2681 [RFC2681]; 
      + One-way Loss Pattern Sample Metrics, RFC 3357 [RFC3357]; 
      + IP Packet Delay Variation Metric, RFC 3393 [RFC3393]; 
      + IPPM Metrics for periodic streams, RFC 3432 [RFC3432]; 

They are registered in the node rfc(1). They are numbered using the RFC 
order and the metrics definitions order in each memo. The node assigned 
to a metric is definitive and cannot be reused. 

6.3. Future IPPM metrics registration 

  When the IPPM WG draft is considered mature enough: 

      + The chair of the IPPM WG, or someone proposed by the directors 
        of the Transport Area, assigns to each metric a sub node chosen
        in the tree rfc(1) of the IPPM-METRICS-REGISTRY; 

      + Authors insert a registry template in their document. Then they
        create an OBJECT-IDENTITY instance per metric and complete the 
        instance with the assigned sub nodes. 

  That helps to prepare the final version of the draft. Moreover it 
  facilitates software integration and interoperability measurement 
  during the specification process. 

6.4. Metric defined in cooperation with other bodies 

  Such metrics may be registered in the node otherBodies(2). 

  Nothing prevents these bodies from registering metrics in their own 
  object identifier trees.

12. Security Considerations 

  All the items specified in this MIB module are defined using the 
  macro OBJECT-IDENTITY. This macro does not have a MAX-ACCESS clause. 

  There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have 
  a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this 
  MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an 
  intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB 
  module via direct SNMP SET operations.

  It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as 
  provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
  including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
  authentication and privacy). 

  Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
  RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
  enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
  instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to 
  the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
  rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
