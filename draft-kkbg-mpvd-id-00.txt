Internet-Draft             PVD Identification              February 2014


1.  Introduction

   The MIF working group is producing a solution to solve the issues
   that are associated with nodes that can be attached to multiple
   networks based on the Multiple Provisioning Domains (MPVD)
   architecture work [I-D.ietf-mif-mpvd-arch].  This document describes
   a format for carrying identification information along with a few
   alternatives for reasonable sources for PVD identification.  Since
   the PVD IDs are expected to be unique, the identification sources
   provide some level of uniqueness using either a hierarchical
   structure (e.g.  FQDNs and OIDs) or some form of randomness (e.g.
   UUID and ULAs).  Any source that does not provide either guaranteed
   or probabilistic uniqueness is probably not a good candidate for
   identifying provisioning domains.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Provisioning domain identity format

   The identity of the PVD is independent of the configuration protocol
   used to communicate it and is formatted as follows.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    id-type    |   id-length   |                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               +
   +                    PVD identity information                   +
   .                       (variable length)                       .
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

Internet-Draft             PVD Identification              February 2014


    o  id-type: Describes the type of identification information.
       This document defines six types of PVD identity information
         0x01: UUID [RFC4122]
         0x02: UTF-8 string
         0x03: OID [OID]
         0x04: NAI Realm [RFC4282]
         0x05: FQDN
         0x06: ULA Prefix [RFC4193]
         Further types can be added by IANA action.

    o  id-length: Length of the PVD identification  in octets
       not including the id-type and id-length fields.

    o  PVD identity information: The PVD identification that is
       based on the id-type.


4.  Security Considerations

   An attacker may attempt to modify the PVD identity provided in a
   configuration protocol.  These attacks can be prevented by using the
   configuration protocol mechanisms such as SEND [RFC3971] and DHCPv6
   AUTH option [RFC3315] that detect any form of tampering with the
   configuration.

   A compromised configuration source, on the other hand, cannot easily
   be detected by a configuration client.  The only real way to avoid
   this is that the PvD identification is directly associable to some
   form of authentication and authorization information from the owner
   of the PvD (e.g. an FQDN can be associated with a DANE cert).  Then,
   this attack can be detected by the client by verifying the
   authentication and authorization information provided inside the PVD
   container option after verifying its trust towards the PvD owner
   (e.g. a certificate with a well-known/common trust anchor that).


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates a new registry for PVD id types.  The initial
   values are listed below

         0x01: UUID [RFC4122]
         0x02: UTF-8 string
         0x03: OID [OID]
         0x04: NAI Realm [RFC4282]
         0x05: FQDN
         0x06: ULA Prefix [RFC4193]
