1. Introduction
   The existing drafts perform control packets snooping during the
   course of address assignment to set up bindings between IP addresses
   and corresponding anchors. But referring to [SAVI Analysis], there
   are various circumstances which will cause a data packet's address
   unbound at the first SAVI device of its forwarding path. Therefore,
   when a SAVI device receives a data packet with unbound source
   address, it SHOULD perform data triggered binding creation process,
   instead of directly discarding the packet.

   This document describes a procedure of data packet triggered binding
   creation, which is suitable for DHCP assigned addresses, stateless
   address and manually configured addresses. This procedure can help 
   minimize loss of legitimate packets as well as prevent the use of 
   forged or spoofed addresses. This solution provides a kind of
   supplemental binding process for existing drafts ([SAVI DHCP] and
   [SAVI Stateless]).

   Control Packet - In this document, packets that may cause state
                    transit are classified into control packets,
                    including DHCPv4/v6 Request, DHCPv6 Confirm, DHCPv6
                    Solicitation with Rapid Commit option, DAD NS and
                    gratuitous ARP. Whenever a SAVI device receives a
                    control packet from its SAVI-Validation anchor, it
                    will start binding creation process for the source
                    address or target address of the packet.

   Data Packet    - All other packets are considered to be data packets
                    in this document. Every data packet received by the
                    SAVI-Validation anchor MUST be checked. If the
                    source address of the data packet matches an entry
                    of FT, this packet MUST be forward; if not, the data
                    packet triggered binding creation process SHOULD be
                    started.

3. Mechanism Overview

   The mechanism specified in this document is designed to provide a 
   possible approach about how to deal with data packets with unbound
   addresses. When the SAVI device receives a data packet with unbound
   address from its SAVI-Validation anchor, it will perform Address
   Reachability Detection to detect the address's activity, and
   communicate with other SAVI devices in the same subnet to check the
   address's binding status. If the detection and the check are
   successful, the SAVI device will add an entry for the address in its
   local FT.

4. Modified Data Structures

   This section describes the possible two data structures used in this 
   mechanism. The two data structures follow the structures defined in 
   existing drafts, with a MAC address field added.

   This small modification is necessary and has the following goods:
   * Validate IP addresses as well as MAC addresses
   * Use MAC addresses besides switch ports as binding anchors
   * Serve the Address Reachability Detection specified in section 7

5. Binding States Description

   This section describes the binding states added in this mechanism.

   Probe: When a SAVI device performs Address Reachability Detection for
   a binding or bound address, the corresponding entry's State in local
   BST MUST be set to Probe.
   
   Add: When a SAVI device communicates with other SAVI devices in the 
   same subnet to check an address's binding status, the corresponding 
   entry's State in local BST MUST be set to Add.

6. Additional Anchor Attributes

   This section specifies the anchor attribute added in this mechanism.
   
   SAVI-AddBinding: If and only if an anchor with SAVI-Validation 
   attribute can have SAVI-AddBinding attribute. The SAVI device MUST 
   change the anchor's attribute from SAVI-Validation to
   SAVI-AddBinding, when data packet triggered binding process is
   performed on this anchor. An anchor with SAVI-AddBinding attribute
   will discard any data packets with unbound addresses.

7.1. Send a Data Packet

   Host-X sends a data packet, and the packet is received by SAVI-X from
   an SAVI-Validation anchor, which is marked Anchor-X. The source
   address of this packet MAY be a legal address that Host-X got from
   normal address assignment, or MAY be an illegal address for malicious
   purpose.
   
7.2. Source Address Check

   SAVI-X reads the data packet's source MAC address (MAC-X) and source
   IP address (IP-X), and then queries local FT for IP-X and MAC-X:
   - If IP-X is in FT, but the entry's MAC address is not MAC-X, then
     the data packet MUST be discarded, and the binding creation process
     is terminated here.
   
   - If IP-X is in FT, and the entry's MAC address is MAC-X, and the 
     entry's anchor is Anchor-X, then the data packet MUST be forwarded,
     and the binding creation process is terminated here.
   
   - If IP-X is in FT, and the entry's MAC address is MAC-X, but the
     entry's anchor is Anchor-Z, then the data packet SHOULD be
     discarded and Anchor-X's attribute MUST be set to SAVI-AddBinding.
     After that, go to subsection 7.3..

   - If IP-X is not in FT, then the data packet SHOULD be discarded and
     Anchor-X's attribute MUST be set to SAVI-AddBinding. After that, go
     to subsection 7.4..

7.3. Bound Address Reachability Detection

   This subsection is aimed to detect whether the bound address in FT is
   still reachable through the port it was bound. The detecting entry in
   FT is as Figure 4 shows:
             +----------+---------+-------------+
             |  Anchor  | Address | MAC Address |
             +----------+---------+-------------+
             | Anchor-Z |   IP-X  |    MAC-X    |
             +----------+---------+-------------+
          Figure 4 the Detecting Entry in FT of SAVI-X

   SAVI-X sends an Echo Request Message towards Host-Z through Anchor-Z,
   using IP-X as source IP address and MAC-X as source MAC address. 
   Then, SAVI-X waits for the reply.

   The case that an Echo Reply Message is received from Anchor-Z implies
   the bound address is still reachable. SAVI-X can get the fact that
   Host-X is spoofing the source address of Host-Z. Therefore, SAVI-X

Internet-Draft       data-packet-triggered-binding           August 2010


   MUST set Anchor-X's attribute back to SAVI-Validation and terminate
   the binding creation process here.

   The case that no Echo Reply Message is received implies the bound
   address is not reachable now. This situation is probably resulted by
   the host's moving from Anchor-Z to Anchor-X, or by link topology
   change. Then SAVI-X will perform the following subsections. Before
   that, SAVI-X MUST delete the entry about IP-X in FT and update the
   entry about IP-X in BST as Figure 5 shows:

   +----------+---------+-------------+-------+---------------+-------+
   |  Anchor  | Address | MAC Address | State |   Lifetime    | Other |
   +----------+---------+-------------+-------+---------------+-------+
   | Anchor-X |   IP-X  |    MAC-X    | Probe | MAX_PROBE_    |DHCP or|
   |          |         |             |       | RESPONSE_TIME |NO_DHCP|
   +----------+---------+-------------+-------+---------------+-------+
        Figure 5 the Updated Entry about IP-X in BST of SAVI-X

   The DHCP or NO_DHCP is kept to mark the address assignment method is
   DHCP or not DHCP.

7.4. Binding Address Reachability Detection

   This subsection is aimed to detect whether the source address of the
   data packet received in subsection 7.1 is a communicational and
   active address.

   SAVI-X sends an Echo Request Message towards Host-X through Anchor-X,
   using IP-X as source IP address and MAC-X as source MAC address.
   Then, SAVI-X waits for the reply.

   The case that no Echo Reply Message is received from Anchor-X implies
   IP-X or MAC-X is inactive. SAVI-X can get the fact that Host-X is
   using forged addresses. Therefore, SAVI-X MUST set Anchor-X's
   attribute back to SAVI-Validation and terminate the binding creation
   process here. In addition, the entry about IP-X in BST MUST be
   deleted, if there is one.

   The case that an Echo Reply Message is received implies IP-X and
   MAC-X are active. SAVI-X needs to make a decision now.

   - If this subsection is arrived after successfully performed
     subsection 7.3., SAVI-X MUST update the entry about IP-X in BST as
     Figure 6 shows, and insert an entry about IP-X into FT (as Figure 7
     shows). Finally, SAVI-X MUST set Anchor-X's attribute back to
     SAVI-Validation to finish the data packet triggered binding
     creation process.

     Before that, an entry about IP-X MUST be inserted into BST (as

7.5. Send SAVI Multicast Query Message

   SAVI-X sends a SAVI Multicast Query Message to the SAVI multicast
   address, with querying address IP-X and MAC-X inside. The SAVI
   multicast address is the address of the multicast group that every
   SAVI device joined.

7.6. Query Address from FT

   SAVI-Y receives the SAVI Multicast Query Message, gets the querying
   address IP-X and MAC-X. Then SAVI-Y queries local FT for IP-X and
   MAC-X:

   - If IP-X is not in FT, SAVI-Y will do nothing and keep silent.

   - If IP-X is in FT, but the entry's MAC address is not MAC-X, SAVI-Y
     will send a SAVI-MReply-AddrError Message to SAVI-X, with IP-X
     inside. Then go to subsection 7.9..

   - If IP-X is in FT, and the entry's MAC address is MAC-X, SAVI-Y
     will perform the next subsection.

7.7. Bound Address Reachability Detection

   This subsection is aimed to detect whether the bound address in FT of   
   SAVI-Y is still reachable through the port it was bound. The
   detecting entry in FT is as Figure 9 shows:

              +----------+---------+-------------+
              |  Anchor  | Address | MAC Address |
              +----------+---------+-------------+
              | Anchor-Y |   IP-X  |    MAC-X    |
              +----------+---------+-------------+
          Figure 9 the Detecting Entry in FT of SAVI-Y

   SAVI-Y sends an Echo Request Message towards Host-Y through Anchor-Y,
   using IP-X as source IP address and MAC-X as source MAC address.

7.8. SAVI Query Reply

   If SAVI-Y receives an Echo Reply Message from Anchor-Y, SAVI-Y will
   send a SAVI-MReply-Reachable Message to SAVI-X, with IP-X inside.

   If SAVI-Y does not receive any Echo Reply Message, SAVI-Y will send a
   SAVI-MReply-Unreachable Message to SAVI-X, with IP-X inside. SAVI-Y
   will also delete the entry about IP-X in local FT and BST.

7.9. Update BST and FT

   SAVI-X waits and collects the SAVI Reply Messages: 

   If SAVI-X receives a SAVI-MReply-AddrError Message, it can get the
   fact that Host-X is spoofing the IP address of Host-Y. SAVI-X MUST
   delete the entry about IP-X in local BST, and set Anchor-X's
   attribute back to SAVI-Validation. The data packet triggered binding
   creation process finishes.

   If SAVI-X receives a SAVI-MReply-Reachable Message, it can get the
   fact that Host-X is spoofing the IP address and MAC address of 
   Host-Y. SAVI-X MUST delete the entry about IP-X in local BST, and
   set Anchor-X's attribute back to SAVI-Validation. The data packet
   triggered binding creation process finishes.

   If SAVI-X receives a SAVI-MReply-Unreachable Message, it can get the
   fact that IP-X had been bound at another SAVI device. This situation
   is probably resulted by the host's moving from SAVI-Y to SAVI-X, or
   by link topology change. SAVI-X MUST update the entry about IP-X in

   BST as Figure 10 shows and insert an entry about IP-X into FT (as
   Figure 7 shows). SAVI-X MUST also set Anchor-X's attribute back to
   SAVI-Validation. The data packet triggered binding creation process
   finishes.

   +----------+---------+-------------+-------+---------------+-------+
       Figure 10 the Updated Entry about IP-X in BST of SAVI-X

   If SAVI-X does not receive any SAVI Reply Message, it can get the
   fact that IP-X has not appeared in the subnet before. This situation
   is probably resulted by control packets loss or SAVI state loss or it
   MAY be an invalid address. SAVI-X will perform different actions
   according to the value of Other field in BST:

   - If the Other in BST is DHCP, SAVI-X SHOULD delete the entry about
     IP-X in local BST, and set Anchor-X's attribute back to
     SAVI-Validation. The data packet triggered binding creation process
     finishes.

   - If the Other in BST is NO_DHCP, SAVI-X SHOULD update the entry
     about IP-X in BST as Figure 10 shows and insert an entry about IP-X
     into FT (as Figure 7 shows). SAVI-X MUST also set Anchor-X's
     attribute back to SAVI-Validation. The data packet triggered
     binding creation process finishes.

8. Arguments & Backup Approach in DHCP Network

8.1. Arguments in DHCP Network

   Subsection 7.5.~7.9. described the mechanism of SAVI Multicast Query,
   which is perfectly light and effective in both DHCP and SLAAC
   network. However, there is a tiny shortcoming when implement it in
   DHCP network.

   In the procedure of SAVI Multicast Query, a SAVI device sends a SAVI
   Multicast Query Message to all SAVI devices to query certain
   addresses. Every SAVI device receiving the message will reply to the
   message sender in case it finds the querying addresses in its local
   FT. In this way, if the SAVI Multicast Query Message sender does not
   get any reply, it will understand that the querying addresses have
   not appeared in the subnet before. However, the exactly SAVI device
   which has the record of the querying addresses may reboot or get off
   the link. This extreme case can also cause the no-reply result



Yang                 Expires March 04, 2011                    [Page 11]

Internet-Draft       data-packet-triggered-binding           August 2010


   described above. 

   Ignoring the extreme case, SAVI Multicast Query mechanism regards the
   set of recorded IP addresses in all SAVI devices' FTs as the set of
   IP addresses that DHCP server has authorized. In other words, an IP   
   address is a forged address, if it has never appeared in any SAVI
   devices' FTs. So, a SAVI device will delete the corresponding entry
   in BST when it does not receive any SAVI Reply message during
   subsection 7.9., which well reflects the rigorous feature of SAVI
   Multicast Query mechanism. Obviously, this treatment is based on the
   assumption that the extreme case would not happen. Once the extreme
   case unfortunately happened, SAVI device would make false judgments.

8.2. Backup Approach in DHCP Network

   The following part of this section designs a mechanism named SAVI
   Center Query as a backup approach of SAVI Multicast Query in DHCP
   network. SAVI Center Query mechanism needs a SAVI Center Server to
   store the binding statuses of the whole subnet. SAVI Center Server
   can implement on the DHCP server or DHCP Relay. In case the SAVI
   devices reboot or get off the link, SAVI Center Server will still
   provide reliable binding statuses about querying addresses. SAVI
   Center Server holds a SAVI Info Table (SIT):

          +---------+-------------+--------------+----------+
          | Address | MAC Address | SAVI address |  Anchor  |
          +---------+-------------+--------------+----------+
          |  IP-1   |    MAC-1    |    SAVI-1    | Anchor-1 |
          +---------+-------------+--------------+----------+
          |  IP-2   |    MAC-2    |    SAVI-2    | Anchor-2 |
          +---------+-------------+--------------+----------+
                   Figure 11 Instance of SIT

   Every SAVI device in the subnet will report the new bound address
   when it creates an entry in its local FT, and will report the new
   deleted address when it removes an entry in its local FT. An address
   is a forged address if it isn't recorded in SIT.

   The following subsections specify the procedure of data packet
   triggered binding creation based on SAVI Center Query.

Figure 12 Data Packet Trigger Binding Process Based on SAVI Center Query

   The Host-X is the host sends the data packet; the SAVI-X is the SAVI
   device that Host-X connected to; the Host-Z is the host bound at
   SAVI-X through anchor Anchor-Z; the SAVI-Y represents any SAVI
   device except SAVI-X in the subnet; the Host-Y is the host bound at
   SAVI-Y through anchor-Y; SAVI Center is the SAVI Center Server.

8.2.3. Bound Address Reachability Detection

   Refer to subsection 7.3..

8.2.4. Binding Address Reachability Detection

   Refer to subsection 7.4..

8.2.5. Send SAVI Center Query Message

   SAVI-X sends SAVI Center Query Message to SAVI Center Server, with
   querying address IP-X and MAC-X inside.

8.2.6. Query Address from SAVI Info Table

   SAVI Center Server receives the SAVI Center Query Message, gets the
   querying address IP-X and MAC-X. Then SAVI Center Server queries SIT
   for IP-X and MAC-X:

   - If IP-X is in SIT, but the entry's MAC address is not MAC-X, or
     IP-X is not in SIT, SAVI Center Server will send a
     SAVI-CReply-AddrError Message to SAVI-X, with IP-X and MAC-X
     inside. Then go to subsection8.2.11..

   - If SAVI Center Server finds an entry about IP-X as Figure 13 shows,
     it will perform the following subsections.

         +---------+-------------+--------------+----------+
         | Address | MAC Address | SAVI address |  Anchor  |
         +---------+-------------+--------------+----------+

8.2.7. SAVI Uncast Query

   SAVI Center Server sends a SAVI Uncast Query Message to SAVI-Y, with
   IP-X, MAC-X and Anchor-Y inside.

8.2.8. Bound Address Reachability Detection

   This subsection is aimed to detect whether the address bound at
   SAVI-Y is still reachable through the port it was bound.

   SAVI-Y receives the SAVI Uncast Query Message, reads the querying
   address IP-X and MAC-X and querying port Anchor-Y. Then it sends an
   Echo Request Message towards Host-Y through Anchor-Y, using IP-X as
   source IP address and MAC-X as source MAC address.

8.2.9. SAVI Query Reply

   If SAVI-Y receives an Echo Reply Message from Anchor-Y, SAVI-Y will
   send a SAVI-CReply-Reachable Message to SAVI Center Server, with
   IP-X inside. Besides, if there is not any entry about IP-X in its
   local BST or FT, SAVI-Y will also add one there.

   If SAVI-Y does not receive any Echo Reply Message, SAVI-Y will send a
   SAVI-CReply-Unreachable Message to SAVI Center Server, with IP-X
   inside. Besides, SAVI-Y will also delete the entries about IP-X in
   local FT and BST, if there is any.

8.2.10. SAVI Center Reply

   If SAVI Center Sever receives a SAVI-CReply-Reachable Message, it can
   get the fact that Host-X is spoofing the IP address and MAC address
   of Host-Y. Then, SAVI Center Server sends a SAVI-CReply-Prohibit
   Message to SAVI-X.

   If SAVI Center Server receives a SAVI-CReply-Unreachable Message, it
   can get the fact that the original bound address is not reachable
   through its anchor now. This situation is probably resulted by the
   host's movement or by link topology change. SAVI Center Server MUST
   delete the entry about IP-X in SIT, and then sends a
   SAVI-CReply-Permit Message to SAVI-X.

   If SAVI Center Server does not receive any reply from SAVI-Y, we can
   guess that SAVI-Y is off the link now. SAVI Center Server MUST delete
   the entry about IP-X in SIT, and then sends a SAVI-CReply-Permit
   Message to SAVI-X.

8.2.11. Update BST and FT

   SAVI-X waits and collects the SAVI Center Reply Messages:
   If SAVI-X receives a SAVI-CReply-AddrError Message or a
   SAVI-CReply-Prohibit Message, it will delete the entry about IP-X in
   local BST, and set Anchor-X's attribute back to SAVI-Validation. The
   data packet triggered binding creation process finishes.

   If SAVI-X receives a SAVI-CReply-Permit Message, SAVI-X will update
   the entry IP-X in BST as Figure 10 shows, and insert an entry about
   IP-X into FT as Figure 7 shows, and set Anchor-X's attribute back to
   SAVI-Validation. The data packet triggered binding creation process

   finishes.

9. Constants

   MAX_PROBE_RESPONSE_TIME:  The time that a SAVI device waits for Echo
   Reply Message during Address Reachability Detection.

   MAX_SAVI_QUERY_TIME: The time that a SAVI device waits for reply
   message from other SAVI devices or SAVI Center Server during SAVI
   Multicast Query or SAVI Center Query. 

10. Security Considerations

   This solution needs some policies to ensure that all devices in the
   protection perimeter and all SAVI devices in the subnet are legal and
   honest. If the Backup Approach (SAVI Center Query) is implemented,
   some strategies are needed to authenticate the identity of SAVI
   Center and SAVI devices during their communication. 

11. IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA consideration currently.
