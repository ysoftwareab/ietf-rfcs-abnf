1.  Introduction

   This document defines three YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] modules: the first
   defines features and groupings common to both TLS clients and TLS
   servers, the second defines a grouping for a generic TLS client, and
   the third defines a grouping for a generic TLS server.

   Any version of TLS may be configured.  TLS 1.0 [RFC2246] and TLS 1.1
   [RFC4346] are historic and hence the YANG "feature" statements
   enabling them are marked "status obsolete".  TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] is
   obsoleted by TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] but still in common use, and hence its
   "feature" statement is marked "status deprecated".  All the feature
   statements for 1.0, 1.1, and 1.3 have "description" statements
   stating that it is NOT RECOMMENDED to enable obsolete protocol
   versions.

   It is intended that the YANG groupings will be used by applications
   needing to configure TLS client and server protocol stacks.  For
   instance, these groupings are used to help define the data model for
   HTTPS [RFC2818] and NETCONF over TLS [RFC7589] based clients and
   servers in [I-D.ietf-netconf-http-client-server] and
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-netconf-client-server] respectively.

   The client and server YANG modules in this document each define one
   grouping, which is focused on just TLS-specific configuration, and
   specifically avoids any transport-level configuration, such as what
   ports to listen-on or connect-to.  This affords applications the
   opportunity to define their own strategy for how the underlying TCP
   connection is established.  For instance, applications supporting
   NETCONF Call Home [RFC8071] could use the "tls-server-grouping"
   grouping for the TLS parts it provides, while adding data nodes for
   the TCP-level call-home configuration.

1.1.  Relation to other RFCs

   This document presents one or more YANG modules [RFC7950] that are
   part of a collection of RFCs that work together to, ultimately,
   enable the configuration of the clients and servers of both the
   NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040] protocols.

   The modules have been defined in a modular fashion to enable their
   use by other efforts, some of which are known to be in progress at
   the time of this writing, with many more expected to be defined in
   time.

1.2.  Specification Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Adherence to the NMDA

   This document is compliant with the Network Management Datastore
   Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].  For instance, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors] and [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore],
   trust anchors and keys installed during manufacturing are expected to
   appear in <operational>.

1.4.  Conventions

   Various examples used in this document use a placeholder value for
   binary data that has been base64 encoded (e.g., "BASE64VALUE=").
   This placeholder value is used as real base64 encoded structures are
   often many lines long and hence distracting to the example being
   presented.

2.  The "ietf-tls-common" Module

   The TLS common model presented in this section contains features and
   groupings common to both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The "hello-
   params-grouping" grouping can be used to configure the list of TLS
   algorithms permitted by the TLS client or TLS server.  The lists of
   algorithms are ordered such that, if multiple algorithms are
   permitted by the client, the algorithm that appears first in its list
   that is also permitted by the server is used for the TLS transport
   layer connection.  The ability to restrict the algorithms allowed is
   provided in this grouping for TLS clients and TLS servers that are
   capable of doing so and may serve to make TLS clients and TLS servers
   compliant with local security policies.  This model supports both
   TLS1.2 [RFC5246] and TLS 1.3 [RFC8446].

   Thus, in order to support both TLS1.2 and TLS1.3, the cipher-suites
   part of the "hello-params-grouping" grouping should include three
   parameters for configuring its permitted TLS algorithms, which are:
   TLS Cipher Suites, TLS SignatureScheme, TLS Supported Groups.  Note
   that TLS1.2 only uses TLS Cipher Suites.

2.1.  Data Model Overview

   This section provides an overview of the "ietf-tls-common" module in
   terms of its features, identitiesm and groupings.

2.1.1.  Features

   The following diagram lists all the "feature" statements defined in
   the "ietf-tls-common" module:

   Features:
     +-- tls-1_0
     +-- tls-1_1
     +-- tls-1_2
     +-- tls-1_3
     +-- hello-params

      |  The diagram above uses syntax that is similar to but not
      |  defined in [RFC8340].

2.1.2.  Identities

   The following diagram illustrates the relationship amongst the
   "identity" statements defined in the "ietf-tls-common" module:

   Comments:

   *  The diagram shows that there are two base identities.
   *  One base identity is used to specific TLS versions, while the
      other is used to specify cipher-suites.
   *  These base identities are "abstract", in the object oriented
      programming sense, in that they only define a "class" of things,
      rather than a specific thing.

2.1.3.  Groupings

   The "ietf-tls-common" module defines the following "grouping"
   statement:

   *  hello-params-grouping

   This grouping is presented in the following subsection.

2.1.3.1.  The "hello-params-grouping" Grouping

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] illustrates the "hello-params-
   grouping" grouping:

     grouping hello-params-grouping
       +-- tls-versions
       |  +-- tls-version*   identityref
       +-- cipher-suites
          +-- cipher-suite*   identityref

   Comments:

   *  This grouping is used by both the "tls-client-grouping" and the
      "tls-server-grouping" groupings defined in Section 3.1.2.1 and
      Section 4.1.2.1, respectively.

   *  This grouping enables client and server configurations to specify
      the TLS versions and cipher suites that are to be used when
      establishing TLS sessions.

   *  The "cipher-suites" list is "ordered-by user".

2.1.4.  Protocol-accessible Nodes

   The "ietf-tls-common" module defines only "grouping" statements that
   are used by other modules to instantiate protocol-accessible nodes.

2.2.  Example Usage

   This section shows how it would appear if the "hello-params-grouping"
   grouping were populated with some data.

3.1.  Data Model Overview

   This section provides an overview of the "ietf-tls-client" module in
   terms of its features and groupings.

3.1.1.  Features

   The following diagram lists all the "feature" statements defined in
   the "ietf-tls-client" module:

   Features:
     +-- tls-client-keepalives
     +-- client-ident-x509-cert
     +-- client-ident-raw-public-key
     +-- client-ident-psk
     +-- server-auth-x509-cert
     +-- server-auth-raw-public-key
     +-- server-auth-psk

      |  The diagram above uses syntax that is similar to but not
      |  defined in [RFC8340].

3.1.2.  Groupings

   The "ietf-tls-client" module defines the following "grouping"
   statement:

   *  tls-client-grouping

   This grouping is presented in the following subsection.

3.1.2.1.  The "tls-client-grouping" Grouping

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] illustrates the "tls-client-
   grouping" grouping:

             +-- max-attempts?   uint8

   Comments:

   *  The "client-identity" node, which is optionally configured (as
      client authentication MAY occur at a higher protocol layer),
      configures identity credentials, each enabled by a "feature"
      statement defined in Section 3.1.1.

   *  The "server-authentication" node configures trust anchors for
      authenticating the TLS server, with each option enabled by a
      "feature" statement.

   *  The "hello-params" node, which must be enabled by a feature,
      configures parameters for the TLS sessions established by this
      configuration.

   *  The "keepalives" node, which must be enabled by a feature,
      configures a "presence" container for testing the aliveness of the
      TLS server.  The aliveness-test occurs at the TLS protocol layer.

   *  For the referenced grouping statement(s):

      -  The "local-or-keystore-end-entity-cert-with-key-grouping"
         grouping is discussed in Section 2.1.3.6 of
         [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].
      -  The "local-or-keystore-asymmetric-key-grouping" grouping is
         discussed in Section 2.1.3.4 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].
      -  The "local-or-keystore-symmetric-key-grouping" grouping is
         discussed in Section 2.1.3.3 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].
      -  The "local-or-truststore-certs-grouping" grouping is discussed
         in Section 2.1.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors].
      -  The "local-or-truststore-public-keys-grouping" grouping is
         discussed in Section 2.1.3.2 of
         [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors].
      -  The "hello-params-grouping" grouping is discussed in
         Section 2.1.3.1 in this document.

3.1.3.  Protocol-accessible Nodes

   The "ietf-tls-client" module defines only "grouping" statements that
   are used by other modules to instantiate protocol-accessible nodes.

3.2.  Example Usage

   This section presents two examples showing the "tls-client-grouping"
   grouping populated with some data.  These examples are effectively
   the same except the first configures the client identity using a
   local key while the second uses a key configured in a keystore.  Both
   examples are consistent with the examples presented in Section 2 of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors] and Section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].

   The following configuration example uses local-definitions for the
   client identity and server authentication:

4.  The "ietf-tls-server" Module

   This section defines a YANG 1.1 module called "ietf-tls-server".  A
   high-level overview of the module is provided in Section 4.1.
   Examples illustrating the module's use are provided in Examples
   (Section 4.2).  The YANG module itself is defined in Section 4.3.

4.1.  Data Model Overview

   This section provides an overview of the "ietf-tls-server" module in
   terms of its features and groupings.

4.1.1.  Features

   The following diagram lists all the "feature" statements defined in
   the "ietf-tls-server" module:

     +-- client-auth-x509-cert
     +-- client-auth-raw-public-key
     +-- client-auth-psk

      |  The diagram above uses syntax that is similar to but not
      |  defined in [RFC8340].

4.1.2.  Groupings

   The "ietf-tls-server" module defines the following "grouping"
   statement:

   *  tls-server-grouping

   This grouping is presented in the following subsection.

4.1.2.1.  The "tls-server-grouping" Grouping

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] illustrates the "tls-server-
   grouping" grouping:

   Comments:

   *  The "server-identity" node configures identity credentials, each
      of which is enabled by a "feature".

   *  The "client-authentication" node, which is optionally configured
      (as client authentication MAY occur at a higher protocol layer),
      configures trust anchors for authenticating the TLS client, with
      each option enabled by a "feature" statement.

   *  The "hello-params" node, which must be enabled by a feature,
      configures parameters for the TLS sessions established by this
      configuration.

   *  The "keepalives" node, which must be enabled by a feature,
      configures a flag enabling the TLS client to test the aliveness of
      the TLS server, as well as a "presence" container for testing the
      aliveness of the TLSi client.  The aliveness-tests occurs at the
      TLS protocol layer.

   *  For the referenced grouping statement(s):

      -  The "local-or-keystore-end-entity-cert-with-key-grouping"
         grouping is discussed in Section 2.1.3.6 of
         [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].
      -  The "local-or-keystore-asymmetric-key-grouping" grouping is
         discussed in Section 2.1.3.4 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].
      -  The "local-or-keystore-symmetric-key-grouping" grouping is
         discussed in Section 2.1.3.3 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].
      -  The "local-or-truststore-public-keys-grouping" grouping is
         discussed in Section 2.1.3.2 of
         [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors].
      -  The "local-or-truststore-certs-grouping" grouping is discussed
         in Section 2.1.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors].
      -  The "hello-params-grouping" grouping is discussed in
         Section 2.1.3.1 in this document.

4.1.3.  Protocol-accessible Nodes

   The "ietf-tls-server" module defines only "grouping" statements that
   are used by other modules to instantiate protocol-accessible nodes.

4.2.  Example Usage

   This section presents two examples showing the "tls-server-grouping"
   grouping populated with some data.  These examples are effectively
   the same except the first configures the server identity using a
   local key while the second uses a key configured in a keystore.  Both
   examples are consistent with the examples presented in Section 2 of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors] and Section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].

   The following configuration example uses local-definitions for the
   server identity and client authentication:

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  The "iana-tls-cipher-suite-algs" Module

   The "iana-tls-cipher-suite-algs" YANG module defines a data model
   that is designed to be accessed via YANG based management protocols,
   such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these
   protocols have mandatory-to-implement secure transport layers (e.g.,
   SSH, TLS) with mutual authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   This YANG module defines YANG identities, for a public IANA-
   maintained registry, and a single protocol-accessible read-only node
   for the subset of those identities supported by a server.

   YANG identities are not security-sensitive, as they are statically
   defined in the publicly-accessible YANG module.

Internet-Draft    Groupings for TLS Clients and Servers    December 2021


   The protocol-accessible read-only node for the algorithms supported
   by a server is mildly sensitive, but not to the extent that special
   NACM annotations are needed to prevent read-access to regular
   authenticated administrators.

   This module does not define any writable-nodes, RPCs, actions, or
   notifications, and thus the security consideration for such is not
   provided here.

5.2.  The "ietf-tls-common" YANG Module

   The "ietf-tls-common" YANG module defines "grouping" statements that
   are designed to be accessed via YANG based management protocols, such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols
   have mandatory-to-implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS)
   with mutual authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   Since the module in this document only define groupings, these
   considerations are primarily for the designers of other modules that
   use these groupings.

   None of the readable data nodes defined in this YANG module are
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in network environments.  The NACM
   "default-deny-all" extension has not been set for any data nodes
   defined in this module.

   None of the writable data nodes defined in this YANG module are
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in network environments.  The NACM
   "default-deny-write" extension has not been set for any data nodes
   defined in this module.

   This module does not define any RPCs, actions, or notifications, and
   thus the security consideration for such is not provided here.

5.3.  The "ietf-tls-client" YANG Module

   The "ietf-tls-client" YANG module defines "grouping" statements that
   are designed to be accessed via YANG based management protocols, such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols

   with mutual authentication.

6.2.  The "YANG Module Names" Registry

   This document registers four YANG modules in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].  Following the format in [RFC6020], the following
   registrations are requested:

   name:         iana-tls-cipher-suite-algs
   namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:iana-tls-cipher-suite-algs
   prefix:       tlscsa
   reference:    RFC FFFF

   name:         ietf-tls-common
   namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tls-common
   prefix:       tlscmn
   reference:    RFC FFFF

   name:         ietf-tls-client
   namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tls-client
   prefix:       tlsc
   reference:    RFC FFFF

   name:         ietf-tls-server
   namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tls-server
   prefix:       tlss
   reference:    RFC FFFF

6.3.  The "iana-tls-cipher-suite-algs" Module

   IANA is requested to maintain a YANG module called "iana-tls-cipher-
   suite-algs" that shadows the "TLS Cipher Suites" sub-registry of the
   "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Parameters" registry
   [IANA-CIPHER-ALGS].

   This registry defines a YANG identity for each cipher suite
   algorithm, and a "base" identity from which all of the other
   identities are derived.

   An initial version of this module can be found in Appendix A.1.

   *  Please note that this module was created on June 2st, 2021, and
      that additional entries may have been added in the interim before
      this document's publication.  If this is that case, IANA may
      either publish just an updated module containing the new entries,
      or publish the initial module as is immediately followed by a
      "revision" containing the additional algorithm names.

   *  Please also note that the "status" statement has been set to
      "deprecated", if the "RECOMMENDED" column in the registry had the
      value 'N', and to "obsolete", if the "References" column included

Appendix A.  YANG Modules for IANA

   The module contained in this section was generated by scripts using
   the contents of the associated sub-registry as they existed on June
   2nd, 2021.

A.1.  Initial Module for the "TLS Cipher Suites" Registry

A.1.1.  Data Model Overview

   This section provides an overview of the "iana-tls-cipher-suite-algs"
   module in terms of its identities and protocol-accessible nodes.

A.1.1.1.  Identities

   The following diagram lists the base "identity" statements defined in
   the module, of which there is just one, and illustrates that all the
   derived identity statements are generated from the associated IANA-
   maintained registry [IANA-CIPHER-ALGS].

   Identities:
     +-- cipher-suite-alg-base
       +-- <identity-name from IANA registry>

      |  The diagram above uses syntax that is similar to but not
      |  defined in [RFC8340].

A.1.1.2.  Protocol-accessible Nodes

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] lists all the protocol-
   accessible nodes defined in the "iana-tls-cipher-suite-alg" module:

   module: iana-tls-cipher-suite-algs
     +--ro supported-algorithms
        +--ro supported-algorithm*   identityref

   *  Protocol-accessible nodes are those nodes that are accessible when
      the module is "implemented", as described in Section 5.6.5 of
      [RFC7950].

A.1.2.  Example Usage

   The following example illustrates operational state data indicating
   the TLS cipher suite algorithms supported by the server:

   <CODE ENDS>

Appendix B.  Change Log

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

B.1.  00 to 01

   *  Noted that '0.0.0.0' and '::' might have special meanings.

   *  Renamed "keychain" to "keystore".

B.2.  01 to 02

   *  Removed the groupings containing transport-level configuration.
      Now modules contain only the transport-independent groupings.

   *  Filled in previously incomplete 'ietf-tls-client' module.

   *  Added cipher suites for various algorithms into new 'ietf-tls-
      common' module.

B.3.  02 to 03

   *  Added a 'must' statement to container 'server-auth' asserting that
      at least one of the various auth mechanisms must be specified.

   *  Fixed description statement for leaf 'trusted-ca-certs'.

Internet-Draft    Groupings for TLS Clients and Servers    December 2021


B.4.  03 to 04

   *  Updated title to "YANG Groupings for TLS Clients and TLS Servers"

   *  Updated leafref paths to point to new keystore path

   *  Changed the YANG prefix for ietf-tls-common from 'tlscom' to
      'tlscmn'.

   *  Added TLS protocol verions 1.0 and 1.1.

   *  Made author lists consistent

   *  Now tree diagrams reference ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams

   *  Updated YANG to use typedefs around leafrefs to common keystore
      paths

   *  Now inlines key and certificates (no longer a leafref to keystore)

B.5.  04 to 05

   *  Merged changes from co-author.

B.6.  05 to 06

   *  Updated to use trust anchors from trust-anchors draft (was
      keystore draft)

   *  Now Uses new keystore grouping enabling asymmetric key to be
      either locally defined or a reference to the keystore.

B.7.  06 to 07

   *  factored the tls-[client|server]-groupings into more reusable
      groupings.

   *  added if-feature statements for the new "x509-certificates"
      feature defined in draft-ietf-netconf-trust-anchors.

B.8.  07 to 08

   *  Added a number of compatibility matrices to Section 5 (thanks
      Frank!)

   *  Clarified that any configured "cipher-suite" values need to be
      compatible with the configured private key.

B.9.  08 to 09

   *  Updated examples to reflect update to groupings defined in the
      keystore draft.

   *  Add TLS keepalives features and groupings.

   *  Prefixed top-level TLS grouping nodes with 'tls-' and support
      mashups.

   *  Updated copyright date, boilerplate template, affiliation, and
      folding algorithm.

B.10.  09 to 10

   *  Reformatted the YANG modules.

B.11.  10 to 11

   *  Collapsed all the inner groupings into the top-level grouping.

   *  Added a top-level "demux container" inside the top-level grouping.

   *  Added NACM statements and updated the Security Considerations
      section.

   *  Added "presence" statements on the "keepalive" containers, as was
      needed to address a validation error that appeared after adding
      the "must" statements into the NETCONF/RESTCONF client/server
      modules.

   *  Updated the boilerplate text in module-level "description"
      statement to match copyeditor convention.

B.12.  11 to 12

   *  In server model, made 'client-authentication' a 'presence' node
      indicating that the server supports client authentication.

   *  In the server model, added a 'required-or-optional' choice to
      'client-authentication' to better support protocols such as
      RESTCONF.

   *  In the server model, added a 'local-or-external' choice to
      'client-authentication' to better support consuming data models
      that prefer to keep client auth with client definitions than in a
      model principally concerned with the "transport".

Internet-Draft    Groupings for TLS Clients and Servers    December 2021


   *  In both models, removed the "demux containers", floating the
      nacm:default-deny-write to each descendant node, and adding a note
      to model designers regarding the potential need to add their own
      demux containers.

   *  Fixed a couple references (section 2 --> section 3)

B.13.  12 to 13

   *  Updated to reflect changes in trust-anchors drafts (e.g., s/trust-
      anchors/truststore/g + s/pinned.//)

B.14.  12 to 13

   *  Removed 'container' under 'client-identity' to match server model.

   *  Updated examples to reflect change grouping in keystore module.

B.15.  13 to 14

   *  Removed the "certificate" container from "client-identity" in the
      ietf-tls-client module.

   *  Updated examples to reflect ietf-crypto-types change (e.g.,
      identities --> enumerations)

B.16.  14 to 15

   *  Updated "server-authentication" and "client-authentication" nodes
      from being a leaf of type "ts:certificates-ref" to a container
      that uses "ts:local-or-truststore-certs-grouping".

B.17.  15 to 16

   *  Removed unnecessary if-feature statements in the -client and
      -server modules.

   *  Cleaned up some description statements in the -client and -server
      modules.

   *  Fixed a canonical ordering issue in ietf-tls-common detected by
      new pyang.

B.18.  16 to 17

   *  Removed choice local-or-external by removing the 'external' case
      and flattening the 'local' case and adding a "client-auth-
      supported" feature.

   *  Removed choice required-or-optional.

   *  Updated examples to include the "*-key-format" nodes.

   *  Augmented-in "must" expressions ensuring that locally-defined
      public-key-format are "ct:tls-public-key-format" (must expr for
      ref'ed keys are TBD).

B.19.  17 to 18

   *  Removed the unused "external-client-auth-supported" feature.

   *  Made client-indentity optional, as there may be over-the-top auth
      instead.

   *  Added augment to uses of local-or-keystore-symmetric-key-grouping
      for a psk "id" node.

   *  Added missing presence container "psks" to ietf-tls-server's
      "client-authentication" container.

   *  Updated examples to reflect new "bag" addition to truststore.

   *  Removed feature-limited caseless 'case' statements to improve tree
      diagram rendering.

   *  Refined truststore/keystore groupings to ensure the key formats
      "must" be particular values.

   *  Switched to using truststore's new "public-key" bag (instead of
      separate "ssh-public-key" and "raw-public-key" bags).

   *  Updated client/server examples to cover ALL cases (local/ref x
      cert/raw-key/psk).

B.20.  18 to 19

   *  Updated the "keepalives" containers in part to address Michal
      Vasko's request to align with RFC 8071, and in part to better
      align to RFC 6520.

   *  Removed algorithm-mapping tables from the "TLS Common Model"
      section

   *  Removed the 'algorithm' node from the examples.

   *  Renamed both "client-certs" and "server-certs" to "ee-certs"

   *  Added a "Note to Reviewers" note to first page.

B.21.  19 to 20

   *  Modified the 'must' expression in the "ietf-tls-client:server-
      authention" node to cover the "raw-public-keys" and "psks" nodes
      also.

   *  Added a "must 'ca-certs or ee-certs or raw-public-keys or psks'"
      statement to the ietf-tls-server:client-authentication" node.

   *  Added "mandatory true" to "choice auth-type" and a "presence"
      statement to its ancestor.

   *  Expanded "Data Model Overview section(s) [remove "wall" of tree
      diagrams].

   *  Moved the "ietf-tls-common" module section to proceed the other
      two module sections.

   *  Updated the Security Considerations section.

B.22.  20 to 21

   *  Updated examples to reflect new "cleartext-" prefix in the crypto-
      types draft.

B.23.  21 to 22

   *  In both the "client-authentication" and "server-authentication"
      subtrees, replaced the "psks" node from being a P-container to a
      leaf of type "empty".

   *  Cleaned up examples (e.g., removed FIXMEs)

   *  Fixed issues found by the SecDir review of the "keystore" draft.

   *  Updated the "psk" sections in the "ietf-tls-client" and "ietf-tls-
      server" modules to more correctly reflect RFC 4279.

B.24.  22 to 23

   *  Addressed comments raised by YANG Doctor in the ct/ts/ks drafts.

B.25.  23 to 24

   *  Added missing reference to "FIPS PUB 180-4".

   *  Added identity "tls-1.3" and updated description statement in
      other identities indicating that the protocol version is obsolete
      and enabling the feature is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   *  Added XML-comment above examples explaining the reason for the
      unexpected top-most element's presence.

   *  Added missing "client-ident-raw-public-key" and "client-ident-psk"
      featutes.

   *  Aligned modules with `pyang -f` formatting.

   *  Clarified support for various TLS protocol versions.

   *  Moved algorithms in ietf-tls-common (plus more) to IANA-maintained
      modules

   *  Added "config false" lists for algorithms supported by the server.

   *  Fixed issues found during YANG Doctor review.

B.27.  25 to 26

   *  Replaced "base64encodedvalue==" with "BASE64VALUE=" in examples.
