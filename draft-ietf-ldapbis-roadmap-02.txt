Abstract

  The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an Internet
  protocol for accessing distributed directory services which act in
  accordance with X.500 data and service models.  This document provides
  a roadmap of the LDAP Technical Specification.

Conventions

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].


1. The LDAP Technical Specification

  The technical specification detailing version 3 of the Lightweight
  Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), an Internet Protocol, consists of
  this document and the following documents:

      LDAP: Directory Information Models [Models],
      LDAP: The Protocol [Protocol],
      LDAP: Authentication Methods and Connection Level Security
            Mechanisms [AuthMeth],
      LDAP: String Representation of Distinguished Names [LDAPDN],
      LDAP: String Representation of Search Filters [Filters],
      LDAP: Uniform Resource Locator [LDAPURL],
      LDAP: Syntaxes [Syntaxes], and
      LDAP: User Schema [Schema].

  The terms "LDAP" and "LDAPv3" are commonly used to informally refer to
  the protocol specified by this technical specification.  The LDAP
  suite, as defined here, should be formally identified in other
  documents by a normative reference to this document.

  Extensions to LDAP may be specified in other documents.  Nomenclature
  denoting such combinations of LDAP-plus-extension(s) is not defined by
  this document but may be defined in some future document(s).

  IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) considerations for LDAP
  described in BCP 64 [RFC3383] apply fully to this revision of the LDAP
  technical specification.


2. Relationship to X.500

  This technical specification defines LDAP in terms of [X.500] as an
  X.500 access mechanism.  An LDAP server MUST act in accordance with
  X.500(1993) series of International Telephone Union (ITU)
  Recommendations when providing the service.  However, it is not
  required that an LDAP server make use of any X.500 protocols in
  providing this service, e.g. LDAP can be mapped onto any other
  directory system so long as the X.500 data and service models
  [X.501][X.511] as used in LDAP is not violated in the LDAP interface.

INTERNET-DRAFT        draft-ietf-ldapbis-roadmap-02         1 March 2003


  This technical specification explicitly incorporates portions of
  X.500(93).  Later revisions of X.500 do not automatically apply.


3. Security Considerations

  LDAP security considerations are discussed in each document comprising
  the technical specification.


4. Relationship to Obsolete Specifications

  This technical specification, as defined in Section 1, obsoletes
  entirely the previously defined LDAP technical specification [RFC3377]
  (which consists of RFC 2251-2256, RFC 2829-2830 and [RFC3377] itself).
  The technical specification was significantly reorganized.

  This document replaces RFC 3377 as well as Section 3.3 of RFC 2251.
  [Models] replaces portions of RFC 2251, RFC 2252 and RFC 2256.
  [Protocol] replaces the majority RFC 2251 and portions of RFC 2252.
  [AuthMeth] replaces RFC 2829, RFC 2830, and portions of RFC 2251.
  [Syntax] replaces the majority of RFC 2252 and portions of RFC 2256.
  [Schema] replaces the majority of RFC 2256.  [LDAPDN] replaces RFC
  2253.  [Filters] replaces RFC 2254.  [LDAPURL] replaces RFC 2255.

  Each document of this specification contains appendices summarizing
  changes to all sections of the specifications they replace.  Appendix
  A.1 of this document details changes made to RFC 3377.  Appendix A.2
  of this document details changes made to Section 3.3 of RFC 2251.

Appendix A.  Changes to Previous Documents

             This appendix outlines changes this document makes relative
             to the documents it replaces (in whole or in part).


Appendix A.1. Changes to RFC 3377

             This document is nearly a complete rewrite of RFC 3377 as
             much of the material of RFC 3377 is no longer applicable.
             These changes include defining the terms "LDAP" and
             "LDAPv3" to refer to this revision of the technical
             specification.


Appendix A.2. Changes to Section 3.3 of RFC 2251

             The section was modified slightly (the word "document" was
             replaced with "technical specification") to clarify that it
             applies to the entire LDAP technical specification.
