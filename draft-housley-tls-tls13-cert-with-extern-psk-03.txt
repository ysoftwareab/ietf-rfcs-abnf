Internet-Draft        Certificate with External PSK        November 2018


1.  Introduction

   The TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] handshake protocol provides two mutually
   exclusive forms of server authentication.  First, the server can be
   authenticated by providing a signature certificate and creating a
   valid digital signature to demonstrate that it possesses the
   corresponding private key.  Second, the server can be authenticated
   by demonstrating that it possesses a pre-shared key (PSK) that was
   established by a previous handshake.  A PSK that is established in
   this fashion is called a resumption PSK.  A PSK that is established
   by any other means is called an external PSK.  This document
   specifies a TLS 1.3 extension permitting certificate-based server
   authentication to be combined with an external PSK as an input to the
   TLS 1.3 key schedule.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Motivation and Design Rationale

   The invention of a large-scale quantum computer would pose a serious
   challenge for the cryptographic algorithms that are widely deployed
   today, including the digital signature algorithms that are used to
   authenticate the server in the TLS 1.3 handshake protocol.  It is an
   open question whether or not it is feasible to build a large-scale
   quantum computer, and if so, when that might happen.  However, if
   such a quantum computer is invented, many of the cryptographic
   algorithms and the security protocols that use them would become
   vulnerable.

   The TLS 1.3 handshake protocol employs key agreement algorithms that
   could be broken by the invention of a large-scale quantum computer
   [I-D.hoffman-c2pq].  These algorithms include Diffie-Hellman (DH)
   [DH] and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) [IEEE1363].  As a
   result, an adversary that stores a TLS 1.3 handshake protocol
   exchange today could decrypt the associated encrypted communications
   in the future when a large-scale quantum computer becomes available.

   In the near-term, this document describes TLS 1.3 extension to
   protect today's communications from the future invention of a large-
   scale quantum computer by providing a strong external PSK as an input
   to the TLS 1.3 key schedule while preserving the authentication

   provided by the existing certificate and digital signature
   mechanisms.

4.  Extension Overview

   This section provides a brief overview of the
   "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension.

   The client includes the "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension in the
   ClientHello message.  The "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension MUST
   accompanied by the "key_share", "psk_key_exchange_modes", and
   "pre_shared_key" extensions.  The "pre_shared_key" extension MUST be
   the last extension in the ClientHello message, and it provides a list
   of external PSK identifiers that the client is willing to use with
   this server.  Since tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension is intended
   to be used only with initial handshakes, it MUST NOT be sent
   alongside the "early_data" extension.  These extension are all
   described in Section 4.2 of [RFC8446].

   If the server is willing to use one of the external PSKs listed in
   the "pre_shared_key" extension and perform certificate-based
   authentication, then the server includes the
   "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension in the ServerHello message.  The
   "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension MUST accompanied by the
   "key_share" and "pre_shared_key" extensions.  If none of the external
   PSKs in the list provided by the client is acceptable to the server,
   then the "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension is omitted from the
   ServerHello message.

   The successful negotiation of the "tls_cert_with_extern_psk"
   extension requires the TLS 1.3 key schedule processing to include
   both the selected external PSK and the (EC)DHE shared secret value.
   As a result, the Early Secret, Handshake Secret, and Master Secret
   values all depend upon the value of the selected external PSK.

   The authentication of the server and optional authentication of the
   client depend upon the ability to generate a signature that can be
   validated with the public key in their certificates.  The
   authentication processing is not changed in any way by the selected
   external PSK.

   Each external PSK is associated with a single Hash algorithm.  The
   hash algorithm MUST be set when the PSK is established, with a
   default of SHA-256 if no hash algorithm is specified during
   establishment.

5.  Certificate with External PSK Extension

   This section specifies the "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension,
   which MAY appear in the ClientHello message and ServerHello message.
   It MUST NOT appear in any other messages.  The
   "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension MUST NOT appear in the
   ServerHello message unless "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension
   appeared in the preceding ClientHello message.  If an implementation
   recognizes the "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension and receives it
   in any other message, then the implementation MUST abort the
   handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert.

   The general extension mechanisms enable clients and servers to
   negotiate the use of specific extensions.  Clients request extended
   functionality from servers with the extensions field in the
   ClientHello message.  If the server responds with a HelloRetryRequest
   message, then the client sends another ClientHello message as
   described in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC8446], and it MUST include the same
   "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension as the original ClientHello
   message or abort the handshake.

   Many server extensions are carried in the EncryptedExtensions
   message; however, the "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension is carried
   in the ServerHello message.  It is only present in the ServerHello
   message if the server recognizes the "tls_cert_with_extern_psk"
   extension and the server possesses one of the external PSKs offered
   by the client in the "pre_shared_key" extension in the ClientHello
   message.

   The Extension structure is defined in [RFC8446]; it is repeated here
   for convenience.

     struct {
         ExtensionType extension_type;
         opaque extension_data<0..2^16-1>;
     } Extension;


   The "extension_type" identifies the particular extension type, and
   the "extension_data" contains information specific to the particular
   extension type.

   This document specifies the "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension,
   adding one new type to ExtensionType:

     enum {
         tls_cert_with_extern_psk(TBD), (65535)
     } ExtensionType;


   The "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension is relevant when the client
   and server possess an external PSK in common that can be used as an
   input to the TLS 1.3 key schedule.

   To use an external PSK with certificates, clients MUST provide the
   "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension, and it MUST be accompanied by
   the "key_share", "psk_key_exchange_modes", and "pre_shared_key"
   extensions in the ClientHello.  If clients offer a
   "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension without all of these other
   extensions, servers MUST abort the handshake.  The client MAY also
   find it useful to include the the "supported_groups" extension.  Note
   that Section 4.2 of [RFC8446] allows extensions to appear in any
   order, with the exception of the "pre_shared_key" extension, which
   MUST be the last extension in the ClientHello.  Also, there MUST NOT
   be more than one instance of each extension in the ClientHello
   message.

   The "key_share" extension is defined in Section 4.2.8 of [RFC8446].

   The "psk_key_exchange_modes" extension is defined in Section 4.2.9 of
   [RFC8446].  The "psk_key_exchange_modes" extension restricts both the
   use of PSKs offered in this ClientHello and those which the server
   might supply via a subsequent NewSessionTicket.  As a result, clients
   MUST include the psk_dhe_ke mode, and clients MAY also include the
   psk_ke mode to support a subsequent NewSessionTicket.  Servers MUST
   select the psk_dhe_ke mode for the initial handshake.  Servers MUST
   select a key exchange mode that is listed by the client for
   subsequent handshakes that include the resumption PSK from the
   initial handshake.

   The "supported_groups" extension is defined in Section 4.2.7 of
   [RFC8446].

   The "pre_shared_key" extension is defined in Section 4.2.11 of
   [RFC8446]. the syntax is repeated below for convenience.  All of the
   listed PSKs MUST be external PSKs.

     struct {
         opaque identity<1..2^16-1>;
         uint32 obfuscated_ticket_age;
     } PskIdentity;

     opaque PskBinderEntry<32..255>;

     struct {

             case server_hello: uint16 selected_identity;
         };
     } PreSharedKeyExtension;


   The OfferedPsks contains the list of PSK identities and associated
   binders for the external PSKs that the client is willing to use with
   the server.

   The identities are a list of external PSK identities that the client
   is willing to negotiate with the server.  Each external PSK has an
   associated identity that is known to the client and the server.  (The
   identity is also referred to as an identifier or a label.)

   The obfuscated_ticket_age is not used for external PSKs; clients
   SHOULD set this value to 0, and servers MUST ignore the value.

   The binders are a series of HMAC values, one for each external PSK
   offered by the client, in the same order as the identities list.  The
   HMAC value is computed using the binder_key, which is derived from
   the external PSK, and a partial transcript of the current handshake.
   Generation of the binder_key from the external PSK is described in
   Section 7.1 of [RFC8446].  The partial transcript of the current
   handshake includes a partial ClientHello up to and including the
   PreSharedKeyExtension.identities field as described in
   Section 4.2.11.2 of [RFC8446].

   The selected_identity contains the external PSK identity that the
   server selected from the list offered by the client.  If none of the
   offered external PSKs in the list provided by the client are
   acceptable to the server, then the "tls_cert_with_extern_psk"
   extension MUST be omitted from the ServerHello message.  The server
   MUST validate the binder value that corresponds to the selected

   external PSK as described in Section 4.2.11.2 of [RFC8446].  If the
   binder does not validate, the server MUST abort the handshake with an
   "illegal_parameter" alert.  Servers SHOULD NOT attempt to validate
   multiple binders; rather they SHOULD select one of the offered
   external PSKs and validate only the binder that corresponds to that
   external PSK.

   When the "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension is successfully
   negotiated, authentication of the server depends upon the ability to
   generate a signature that can be validated with the public key in the
   server's certificate.  This is accomplished by the server sending the
   Certificate and CertificateVerify messages as described in Sections
   4.4.2 and 4.4.3 of [RFC8446].

   TLS 1.3 does not permit the server to send a CertificateRequest
   message when a PSK is being used.  This restriction is removed when
   the "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension is negotiated, allowing the
   certificate-based authentication for both the client and the server.
   If certificate-based client authentication is desired, this is
   accomplished by the client sending the Certificate and
   CertificateVerify messages as described in Sections 4.4.2 and 4.4.3
   of [RFC8446].

   Section 7.1 of [RFC8446] specifies the TLS 1.3 Key Schedule.  The
   successful negotiation of the "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension
   requires the key schedule processing to include both the external PSK
   and the (EC)DHE shared secret value.

   If the client and the server have different values associated with
   the selected external PSK identifier, then the client and the server
   will compute different values for every entry in the key schedule,
   which will lead to the termination of the connection with a
   "decrypt_error" alert.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the TLS ExtensionType Registry to include
   "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" with a value of TBD and the list of
   messages "CH, SH" in which the "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension
   may appear.

7.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations in [RFC8446] remain relevant.

   TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] does not permit the server to send a
   CertificateRequest message when a PSK is being used.  This
   restriction is removed when the "tls_cert_with_extern_psk" extension

   is offered by the client and accepted by the server.  However, TLS
   1.3 does not permit an external PSK to be used in the same fashion as
   a resumption PSK, and this extension does not alter those
   restrictions.  Thus, a certificate MUST NOT be used with a resumption
   PSK.

   Implementations must protect the external pre-shared key (PSK).
   Compromise of the external PSK will make the encrypted session
   content vulnerable to the future invention of a large-scale quantum
   computer.

   Implementers should not transmit the same content on a connection
   that is protected with an external PSK and a connection that is not.
   Doing so may allow an eavesdropper to correlate the connections,
   making the content vulnerable to the future invention of a large-
   scale quantum computer.

   Implementations must choose external PSKs with a secure key
   management technique, such as pseudo-random generation of the key or
   derivation of the key from one or more other secure keys.  The use of
   inadequate pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) to generate
   external PSKs can result in little or no security.  An attacker may
   find it much easier to reproduce the PRNG environment that produced
   the external PSKs and searching the resulting small set of
   possibilities, rather than brute force searching the whole key space.
   The generation of quality random numbers is difficult.  [RFC4086]
   offers important guidance in this area.

   TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] takes a conservative approach to PSKs; they are
   bound to a specific hash function and KDF.  By contrast, TLS 1.2
   [RFC5246] allows PSKs to be used with any hash function and the TLS
   1.2 PRF.  Thus, the safest approach is to use a PSK with either TLS
   1.2 or TLS 1.3.  However, any PSK that might be used with both TLS
   1.2 and TLS 1.3 must be used with only one hash function, which is
   the one that is bound for use in TLS 1.3.  This restriction is less
   than optimal when users want to provision a single PSK.  While the
   constructions used in TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are both based on HMAC
   [RFC2104], the constructions are different, and there is no known way
   in which reuse of the same PSK in TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 that would
   produce related outputs.
