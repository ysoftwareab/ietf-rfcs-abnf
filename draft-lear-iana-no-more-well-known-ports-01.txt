Abstract

   Amongst other things the IANA manages port assignments for TCP, UDP,
   and SCTP protocols.  This document specifies the procedure by which
   those assignments take place.  The distinction between so-called
   "well known ports" and other public static assignments is deprecated,
   the use of SRV records is encouraged, and documentation of port use
   is strongly encouraged.

Internet-Draft         Port Assignment Procedures              June 2006


1.  Introduction

   For decades the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) [5] has
   managed the registry of port numbers for UDP [2] and TCP [3].  It has
   been the policy of the IANA that regardless of how or if a protocol
   was documented it is best to assign a port upon request so that a
   single port would not end up used for different purposes.  All modern
   general purpose operating systems have had a mapping from mnemonic to
   number.

   In earlier years most operating systems imposed a simple restriction
   on what processes could bind to a port: those ports below 1024 were
   reserved for system use while others were available to users.  This
   restriction remains in some operating systems today.  However, it is
   not imposed on many systems for several reasons:
   o  Special purpose operating systems sometimes make no distinction
      between privileged and unprivileged users, and hence a distinction
      between port assignments is meaningless;
   o  Most computers these days are designed for single user use, and
      the the administrative burden of limiting port access has not been
      shown to be worth the benefit;
   o  The protection offered by restricting ports by number is better
      offered through a more granular approach, such as a file system
      analog.  For example the UNIX approach root that requires
      privileges has been the source of numerous security bugs and
      complex methods to step down administrative access once a port has
      been opened.

   In addition to these problems, it is difficult to predict at the time
   of design whether a protocol and by extension its port will be well
   known.  Further, it is unlikely that any designer would want to
   change code and introduce additional complexity in order to change a
   port assignment once a protocol became well known.

1.1.  Use of SRV Records

   RFC 2782 [4] specifies a means by which ports need not be assigned at
   all.  Instead the DNS SRV resource record is accessed to determine
   what host and port should be accessed.  While it is a debatable point
   as to whether SRV records are appropriate for every service, they are
   assuredly appropriate for some.  Hence protocol designers are
   encouraged to consider use of SRV records as an alternative to
   registering a port with IANA.

1.2.  Improving the state of the registry

   The IANA maintains close to 10,000 entries in its port assignment
   registry.  Of these entries a large number have no stable information

   reference.  Hence a large number of ports are likely assigned to
   protocols that are no longer in use.  It has seemed a reasonable
   policy to allow vendors to have port numbers assigned for their
   private use so that they may design and deploy protocols without
   having to worry about conflict.  But individuals and companies come
   and go, and the use of particular protocols come and go.  More than a
   few times documentation for the protocol making use of a particular
   port has completely vanished, either with an individual or with an
   organization.  While it is still advisable that statically assigned
   ports be reserved, the IANA will be empowered to charge a reasonable
   periodic fee to recoup costs associated with keeping track of
   assignments relating to protocols that are not documented through
   some stable reference.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


2.  IANA Considerations: new port assignment procedure

   The IANA receives requests for new port allocations in a manner it
   deems appropriate, such as a web page or an email request.  Those
   requests that correlate to protocol documents approved by the IESG or
   IRSG are given priority.  The template for such a request shall be
   specified by the IANA, but shall make no distinction between well
   known ports and other reserved ports.

   As part of the request template or as part of IANA considerations,
   requestors shall state why a DNS SRV record is not acceptable for a
   specific use.  For protocols developed within the IETF, the IESG or
   their designate shall review such reasoning.  The IANA will continue
   to maintain a registry of SRV names and associated protocols.

   For those requests made outside the IETF standards process, and in
   particular for those protocols that are not documented via an RFC,
   the IANA MAY charge a fee based on a structure that the IAB or
   designate shall approve.  The purpose of this fee is to recoup costs
   of keeping track of the port assignment.  The IANA MAY set
   reclamation policies to handle cases when the fee is not paid.
   Again, such policies shall be approved by the IAB.  A recognized
   standard development organization shall be exempt from such a fee so
   long as it defines and implements a process acceptable to the IANA to
   keep the database updated.

   Beyond the fee, the IANA MAY at its discretion deny undocumented
   requests or refer them to the IESG for further review.

3.  Security Considerations

   With the collection of billing information and funds there is the
   risk to user privacy.  The IANA will take steps it deems necessary to
   protect all such information collected in accordance with governing
   law and contemporary security safety standards.
