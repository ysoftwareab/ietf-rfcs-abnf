    Formally, this is an incomplete specification because the name
    component string values might validly be encoded with ASN.1 types
    other than PrintableString. Moreover, the formal listing order for
    the name components is reversed from the maybe more natural top down
    approach that is often used in various publications and operator
    display in software products.

    The presence of the nonexistent country code "AA" (freely user
    assigned according to [ISO3166TABLE]) serves a dual purpose: a) to
    make more explicit which of the bottom up or top down listing order
    is in use, and b) to isolate the public domain private key from the
    nationality of any specific organization.
