Internet-Draft          Timezone Service Protocol              July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Timezone information, in general, combines a Universal Coordinated
   Time (UTC) offset with daylight saving time (DST) rules.  Timezones
   are typically tied to specific geographic and geopolitical regions.
   Whilst the UTC offset for particular regions changes infrequently,
   DST rules can change frequently and sometimes with very little notice
   (sometimes hours before a change comes into effect).

   Calendaring and scheduling systems, such as those that use iCalendar
   [RFC5545], as well as operating systems, critically rely on timezone
   information to determine the correct local time.  As such they need
   to be kept up to date with changes to timezone information.  To date
   there has been no fast and easy way to do that.  Often times timezone
   data is supplied in the form of a set of data files that have to be
   "compiled" into a suitable database format for use by the client
   application or operating system.  In the case of operating systems,
   those changes often only get propagated out to client machines when
   there is an operating system update and those may not be frequent
   enough to ensure accurate timezone data is always in place.

   This specification defines a timezone service protocol that allows
   for fast, reliable and accurate delivery of timezone information to
   client systems.  This protocol is based on HTTP [RFC2616] using a
   REST style API.

   A further specification [TODO: reference to TZ XML document] defines
   an XML schema for timezone data that can be used as an interchange
   format between client and server or between servers.  This can be
   used as an alternative to iCalendar [RFC5545] or XML-Calendar
   [I-D.daboo-et-al-icalendar-in-xml] VTIMEZONE component data, when
   such data is not appropriate.

   This specification does not specify the source of the timezone
   information.  It is assumed that a reliable and accurate source is
   available.  Nor does it address the need for global timezone
   identifiers for timezone data.

1.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses XML DTD fragments ([W3C.REC-xml-20081126], Section
   3.2) as a purely notational convention.

   The namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:timezone-service" is reserved

   for the XML elements defined in this specification, its revisions,
   and related specifications.  XML elements defined by individual
   implementations MUST NOT use the
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:timezone-service" namespace, and instead
   should use a namespace that they control.

   When XML element types in the
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:timezone-service" namespace are referenced in
   this document outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string
   "TZ:" will be prefixed to the element types.

1.2.  Glossary of terms

   The following terms with the given meanings are used throughout this
   document.

   Timezone Server:  A server implementing the Timezone Service Protocol
      defined by this specification;

   Timezone Identifier:  A globally unique name which identifies
      timezone information.


2.  Architectural Overview

   The overall process for the delivery of timezone information can be
   visualized via the diagram shown below.

   The overall service is made up of several layers:

   (a) Contributors:  Individuals, governments or organizations which
      provide information about timezone definitions to the publishing
      process.  There can be many contributors.

   (b) Publishers:  Publishers aggregate information from contributors,
      determine the reliability of the information, and based on that
      generate timezone definitions in a format chosen by the
      publishers.  That may be an implementation-defined data format,
      or, preferably, the XML timezone data format described in [TODO:
      reference to TZ XML document].  There can be many publishers, each
      getting data from many different contributors.  In some cases a
      publisher may choose to "re-publish" data from another publisher.

    (c) Root Providers:  Servers which obtain and then provide the
      timezone data from publishers and make that available to other
      servers or clients.  There can be many root providers.  Root
      providers can choose to supply timezone data from one or more (or
      all) publishers.

   (d) Local Providers:  Servers which handle the bulk of the requests
      and reduce the load on root servers.  These will typically be
      simple caches of the root server, located closer to clients.  For
      example a large Internet Service Provider (ISP) may choose to
      setup their own local provider to allow clients within their
      network to make requests of that server rather than making
      requests of servers outside their network.  Local servers will
      cache and periodically refresh data from the root servers.

   (e) Clients:  Applications, operating systems etc., that make use of
      timezone data and retrieve that from either root or local
      providers.

   Some of those layers may be coalesced by implementors.  For example,
   a vendor may choose to implement the entire service as a single
   monolithic virtual server with the address embedded in distributed
   systems.  Others may choose to provide a service consisting of
   multiple layers of providers, many local servers and a small number
   of root servers.

   This specification is only concerned with the protocol used to
   exchange data between providers and from provider to client.  This
   specification does not specify how contributors pass their
   information to publishers, nor how those publishers vet that
   information to obtain the level of trust required of the final
   result.


3.  Timezones Service Protocol

3.1.  General Considerations

3.1.1.  Timezone Formats

   The default format for returning timezone definitions is the
   iCalendar [RFC5545] data format.  In additional, the iCalendar-in-XML
   [I-D.daboo-et-al-icalendar-in-xml] representation is also available.
   Also, TODO: reference, provides a more "generic" timezone definition
   format that is independent of iCalendar, and thus more applicable to
   clients that are not concerned with calendaring and scheduling per
   se.

3.1.2.  Timezone Identitifier Aliases

   Timezone identifier aliases map one timezone identifier onto another.
   Aliases allow the timezone service to map old timezone specifications
   onto a new specification.

Internet-Draft          Timezone Service Protocol              July 2010


   A timezone alias can be provided in the timezone data and should be
   mapped on to the target timezone specification.  This can be done by
   the client or by the server.

   The client can request that aliases be returned along with summary
   information when listing timezones provided by the timezone service.
   Clients can then map received timezone identifiers on to the target
   perhaps avoiding a fetch of the target specification.

   Alternatively, the client can just fetch the timezone specification
   by supplying the timezone identifier alias.  The service will return
   the target timezone specification and it is the clients'
   responsibility to notice that the returned data has a different
   timezone identifier to that requested.  The client SHOULD store the
   mapping so that future requests for that aliased identifier do not
   result in an unnecessary fetch.

3.1.3.  Inactive Timezones

   Over time zone timezone definitions are replaced by others, but are
   maintained for historical purposes.  Often times clients are only
   concerned with timezone whose definitions are valid for current and
   future dates and times.  When listing timezones provided by a
   timezone service, the server will by default only provide the list of
   "active" timezones.  However, clients can use a request parameter to
   have the server also return details for "inactive" timezones.

3.1.4.  Localized Timezone Names

   When presenting timezones to users, clients will typically want to
   display a "presentation" name for the timezone, rather than the
   timezone identifier.  In that case, clients would want a
   "presentation" name localized for the current user.  The timezone
   service can be requested to return localized names for timezones by
   the addition of request parameters.  Names in multiple lanaguages can
   be returned in a single request.

3.1.5.  Conditional Timezone Requests

   Timezone information is generally slow moving.  However, changes need
   to be distributed in a timely manner.  The list of timezones that
   change from even year-to-year will typically be relatively small.

   When listing timezones, a global timestamp is returned by the server,
   and that can be used later by clients to determine if any
   "substantive" change has occurred in the timezone data.  Clients can
   use a conditional list request, supplying a previous global timestamp
   value, to limit the results to timezones which have changed in a

Internet-Draft          Timezone Service Protocol              July 2010


   "substantive" manner since that previous global timestamp.  This
   allows clients to cache the last global timestamp and to periodically
   poll the server for possible changes.  Clients SHOULD limit automatic
   polling to no more than once a week.

   A "substantive" change is one which affects the calculated onsets for
   a timezone or a change to the region it covers.  Changes to
   properties such as description are not treated as a "substantive"
   change.

3.1.6.  Expanded Timezone Data

   Determining timezone offsets at a particular point in time is often a
   complicated process as the rules for daylight saving time can be
   complex.  To help with this, the timezone service provides an
   operation that allows clients to request the server to expand a
   timezone definition into a set of "observances" over a fixed period
   of time.  Each of these observances describes a local onset time and
   UTC offsets for the prior time and the observance time.  Together,
   these provide a quick way for "thin" clients to determine an
   appropriate UTF offset for an arbitrary date without having to do
   full timezone expansion themselves.

3.1.7.  Server Requirements

   All servers MUST deliver timezone information for all timezones.
   This means that any client API implementation can go to a single
   server to get all timezone information.  In turn, any server can
   refresh any of the data from any other server - though the root
   servers may provide the most up-to-date copy of the data.

   All service providers MUST deliver functionally equivalent data for
   all timezones.  This ensures that all parties in a contract agree on
   the UTC time.  Service providers (or publishers) may choose to map a
   particular region on to a different timezone identifier to correct a
   deficiency in the original timezone specification.

   With opaque timezone identifiers this remapping may be short lived
   and the mapping can revert to the original identifier once the
   deficiency has been addressed by the publisher.

3.1.8.  Extensions

   This protocol is designed to be extensible through a standards based
   registration mechanism (see Section 8).  It is anticipated, that
   other useful timezone operations will be added in the future (e.g.,
   mapping a geographical location to timezone identifiers, getting
   change history for timezones).  To that end, servers MUST return

   adescription of their capabilities.  This will allow clients to
   determine if new features have been installed and, if not, fall back
   on earlier features or disable some client capabilities.

3.2.  Server Protocol

   The interactions are simple HTTP [RFC2616] requests.  Any security
   considerations are already handled adequately by HTTP.  All
   interactions between client and server MUST take place using TCP
   connections.

   The HTTP GET request method is used, with information passed in
   request parameters.  The "action" request parameter specifies which
   operation is to take place, other request parameters act as arguments
   to that operation.

3.3.  Discovery

   Client implementations need to either know where the timezone service
   is located or discover it through some mechanism.  To use a timezone
   service, a client needs an FQDN, port and HTTP request-URI path.

3.3.1.  Timezone Service SRV Service Labels

   [RFC2782] defines a DNS-based service discovery protocol that has
   been widely adopted as a means of locating particular services within
   a local area network and beyond, using SRV RR records.  This can be
   used to discover a service's FQDN and port.

   This specification adds two service types for use with SRV records:

   timezone:  Identifies a Timezone server that uses HTTP without
      transport layer security ([RFC2818]).

   timezones:  Identifies a Timezone server that uses HTTP with
      transport layer security ([RFC2818]).

   Clients MUST honor "TTL", "Priority" and "Weight" values in the SRV
   records, as described by [RFC2782].

   Example: service record for server without transport layer security

       _timezone._tcp     SRV 0 1 80 tz.example.com.

   Example: service record for server with transport layer security

       _timezones._tcp    SRV 0 1 443 tz.example.com.

3.3.2.  Timezone Service Well-Known URI

   A "well-known" URI [RFC5785] is registered by this specification for
   the Timezone service, "timezone" (see Section 8).  This URI points to
   a resource that the client can use as the request-URI path for the
   service they are trying to connect to.  The actual service could be
   located at that specific path.  Alternatively the server MAY redirect
   HTTP requests for that resource (using the "301 Moved Permanently"
   status response) to the actual path where it wants to handle
   requests.  Clients MUST handle HTTP redirects on the well-known URI.

3.3.2.1.  Example: well-known URI as context path

   A Timezone server has a "context path" that is the same as the well-
   known URI, so the client will use "/.well-known/timezone" as the path
   for the service after it has first found the FQDN and port via an SRV
   lookup.

3.3.2.2.  Example: well-known URI redirects to actual context path

   A Timezone server has a "context path" that is "/servlet/timezone".
   The client will use "/.well-known/timezone" as the path for the
   service process after it has first found the FQDN and port via an SRV
   lookup.  When the client makes its initial HTTP request against
   "/.well-known/timezone", the server would issue an HTTP 301 redirect
   response with a Location response header using the path "/servlet/
   timezone".  The client would then "follow" this redirect to the new
   resource and continue making HTTP requests there.


4.  Operation Parameters

   All requests require the "action" request parameter to define what
   action is required of the server.

   Servers MUST support the following request parameters.

4.1.  "action" Parameter

   Name:  action

   Description:  Specify the action to be carried out.

   Value:  Any IANA registered operation name.

Internet-Draft          Timezone Service Protocol              July 2010


4.2.  "format" Parameter

   Name:  format

   Description:  Specify the format for the timezone data returned by
      the server as a standard MIME [RFC2046] media-type.  If absent the
      iCalendar [RFC5545] format will be returned with the timezones
      contained within a "VCALENDAR" object (i.e., a default media-type
      of "text/calendar").

   Value:  A MIME [RFC2046] media-type.  The server MUST support the
      following values:

      text/calendar:  Return data as "VTIMEZONE" components embedded in
         a "VCALENDAR" object as per [RFC5545].

      application/calendar+xml:  Return data using the XML
         representation of iCalendar data as per XML-Calendar
         [I-D.daboo-et-al-icalendar-in-xml].

      application/timezones+xml:  Return data using the timezone service
         XML format (TODO: reference).

4.3.  "changesince" Parameter

   Name:  changesince

   Description:  Specify the timestamp for a conditional timezone list
      request in order to restrict the result to timezones changed since
      the given timestamp (see Section 5.2).

   Value:  An iCalendar [RFC5545] "DATE" or "DATE-TIME" value.
      Typically a value returned in a previous request's "dtstamp" XML
      element.

4.4.  "start" Parameter

   Name:  start

   Description:  Specify the inclusive start of a period.

   Value:  An iCalendar [RFC5545] "DATE" or "DATE-TIME" value.  If an
      'end' request parameter is also present, then both the 'start' and
      'end' values MUST be of the same "DATE" or "DATE-TIME" value
      types.

Internet-Draft          Timezone Service Protocol              July 2010


4.5.  "end" Parameter

   Name:  end

   Description:  Specify the exclusive end of a period.

   Value:  An iCalendar [RFC5545] "DATE" or "DATE-TIME" value.  If a
      'start' request parameter is also present, then both the 'start'
      and 'end' values MUST be of the same "DATE" or "DATE-TIME" value
      types.

4.6.  "lang" Parameter

   Name:  lang

   Description:  Specify the language in which locale specific values
      are to be returned. e.g., when fetching aliases, if a language is
      specified, only aliases for that language will be returned.

   Value:  The value is a standard ISO3036 letter code + country code.

4.7.  "returnaliases" Parameter

   Name:  returnaliases

   Description:  If present, indicates that timezone identifier aliases
      should be returned in the timezone list.  When fetching the list
      of timezones the default action is to omit aliases.  The inclusion
      of this parameter causes timezone aliases to be returned in the
      list (see Section 5.2).

   Value:  This parameter takes no value.

4.8.  "returnall" Parameter

   Name:  returnall

   Description:  If present indicates that all timezones should be
      returned.  When fetching the list of timezones the default action
      is to omit inactive timezones.  The inclusion of this parameter
      causes inactive timezones to be returned in the list (see
      Section 5.2).

   Value:  This parameter takes no value.

7.  Security Considerations

   Timezone data is critical in determining local or UTC time for
   devices and in calendaring and scheduling operations.  As such, it is
   vital that a reliable source of timezone data is used.  Servers
   providing a timezone service MUST support HTTP over Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) (as defined by [RFC2818]) with a valid certificate.
   Clients and servers making use of a timezone service SHOULD use HTTP
   over TLS and verify the authenticity of the service being used before
   accepting and using any timezone data from that source.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses one new URN to identify a new XML namespace for
   the response data used in this specification, and defines a new
   registry of "actions" for the timezone service protocol, and defines
   a "well-known" URI using the registration procedure and template from
   Section 5.1 of [RFC5785], and creates two new SRV service label
   aliases.

8.1.  XML namespace

   Registration request for the timezone service namespace:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:timezone-service

   Registrant Contact: See the "Authors' Addresses" section of this
   document.

   XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.

8.2.  Service Operations Registration

   This section defines the process to register new or modified timezone
   service operations with IANA.

Internet-Draft          Timezone Service Protocol              July 2010


8.2.1.  Service Operations Registration Procedure

   The IETF will create a mailing list, timezone-service@ietf.org, which
   can be used for public discussion of timezone service operations
   proposals prior to registration.  Use of the mailing list is strongly
   encouraged.  The IESG will appoint a designated expert who will
   monitor the timezone-service@ietf.org mailing list and review
   registrations.

   Registration of new timezone service operations MUST be reviewed by
   the designated expert and published in an RFC.  A Standard Tracks RFC
   is REQUIRED for the registration of new timezone service operations.
   A Standard Tracks RFC is also REQUIRED for changes to operations
   previously documented in a Standard Tracks RFC.

   The registration procedure begins when a completed registration
   template, defined in the sections below, is sent to
   timezone-service@ietf.org and iana@iana.org.  The designated expert
   is expected to tell IANA and the submitter of the registration within
   two weeks whether the registration is approved, approved with minor
   changes, or rejected with cause.  When a registration is rejected
   with cause, it can be re-submitted if the concerns listed in the
   cause are addressed.  Decisions made by the designated expert can be
   appealed to the IESG Applications Area Director, then to the IESG.
   They follow the normal appeals procedure for IESG decisions.

8.2.2.  Registration Template for Operations

   An operation is defined by completing the following template.

   Name:  The name of the operation.  This is also the value of the
      "action" parameter used in timezone service requests.

   Description:  A general description of the operation, its purpose,
      etc.

   Parameters:  A list of allowed request parameters, indicating whether
      they are "REQUIRED" or "OPTIONAL" and whether they can occur only
      once or multiple times.

   Response  The nature of the response to the HTTP request, e.g., what
      format the response data is in.

8.2.3.  Registration Template for Operation Parameters

   An operation parameter is defined by completing the following
   template.

Internet-Draft          Timezone Service Protocol              July 2010


   Name:  The name of the parameter.

   Description:  A general description of the parameter, its purpose,
      etc.

   Value:  The format of the parameter value, or an indication that the
      parameter has no value.

8.3.  Initial Timezone Service Registries

   The IANA is requested to create and maintain the following registries
   for timezone service operations with pointers to appropriate
   reference documents.

8.3.1.  Operations Registry

   The following table is to be used to initialize the operations
   registry.
