      Route Distinguisher Outbound Route Filter (RD-ORF) for BGP-4
                        draft-wang-idr-rd-orf-02

Abstract

   This draft defines a new Outbound Route Filter (ORF) type, called the
   Route Distinguisher ORF (RD-ORF).  RD-ORF is applicable when the
   routers do not exchange VPN routing information directly (e.g.
   routers in single-domain connect via Route Reflector, or routers in
   Option B/Option C cross-domain scenario).

1.  Introduction

   With the rapid growth of network scale, Route Reflector is introduced
   in order to reduce the network complexity.  Routers in the same
   Autonomous System only need to establish iBGP session with RR to
   transmit routes.

   In VPN scenario shown in Figure 1, PE1 - PE4 establish IBGP sessions
   with RR to ensure the routes can be transmitted within AS100, where
   PE1 and PE3 maintain VRFs of VPN1 and VPN2, PE2 maintains VPN1's VRF
   and PE4 maintains VPN2's VRF.  RR don not maintain any VRFs.

                         Figure 1: Single-domain scenario

   When the VRF of VPN1 in PE2 overflows, due to PE2 and other PEs are
   not iBGP neighbors, BGP Maximum Prefix Features cannot work, so the
   problem on PE2 cannot be known.

   Now, there are two solutions can be used to alleviate this problem:

   o  Route Target Constraint (RTC) as defined in [RFC4684]

   o  Address Prefix ORF as defined in [RFC5292]

   However, RTC can only specify the VPN routes it want, it cannot
   control the route limit within one specific VRF.  Using Address
   Prefix ORF to filter VPN routes need to pre-configuration, but it is
   impossible to know which device may overflow in advance.

   This draft defines a new ORF-type, called the Route Distinguisher ORF
   (RD-ORF).  Based on RD-ORF, VPN routes of a VPN can be controlled
   based on source RD and originator.  This mechanism is event-driven
   and does not need to be pre-configured.  When a VRF of a router
   overflows, the router will find out the main source address and RD of
   VPN routes in this VRF, and send a RD-ORF to its BGP peer that carrys
   the RD and the source address.  If a BGP speaker receives a RD-ORF
   from its BGP peer, it will filter the VPN routes it tends to send
   according to the RD-ORF entry.

   RD-ORF is applicable when the routers do not exchange VPN routing
   information directly (e.g. routers in single-domain connect via Route
   Reflector, or routers in Option B/Option C cross-domain scenario).

   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] .

3.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in this draft:

   o  RD: Route Distinguisher, defined in [RFC4364]

   o  ORF: Outbound Route Filter, defined in [RFC5291]

   o  AFI: Address Family Identifier, defined in [RFC4760]

4.  RD-ORF Encoding

   In this draft, we defined a new ORF type called Route Distinguisher
   Outbound Route Filter (RD-ORF).  The ORF entries are carried in the
   BGP ROUTE-REFRESH message as defined in [RFC5291].  A BGP ROUTE-
   REFRESH message can carry one or more ORF entries, and MUST be
   regenerated when it is tended to be sent to other BGP peers.  The
   ROUTE-REFRESH message which carries ORF entries contains the
   following fields:

   o  AFI (2 octets)

   o  SAFI (1 octet)

   o  When-to-refresh (1 octet): the value is IMMEDIATE or DEFER

   o  ORF Type (1 octet)

   o  Length of ORF entries (2 octets)

   A RD-ORF entry contains a common part and type-specific part.  The
   common part is encoded as follows:

   o  Action (2 bits): the value is ADD, REMOVE or REMOVE-ALL

   o  Match (1 bit): the value is PERMIT or DENY

   o  Reserved (5 bits)

   RD-ORF also contains type-specific part.  The encoding of the type-
   specific part is shown in Figure 2.

                        Figure 2: RD-ORF type-specific encoding

   o  Sequence: identifying the order in which RD-ORF is generated

   o  Route Distinguisher: distinguish the different user routes.  The
      RD-ORF filters the VPN routes it tends to send based on Route
      Distinguisher.

   o  Source Address sub-TLV: the source address is TLV format, which
      contains the following sub-TLVs:

      *  For L3 EVPN case, Gateway IP Address in EVPN RT-5 (IP Prefix
         Advertisement Route) can be used as source address.

            Type = 1, Length = 4 octets, value = IPv4 Gateway IP
            Address.

            Type = 2, Length = 16 octets, value = IPv6 Gateway IP
            Address.

      *  For L2 EVPN case, the source address can be extracted from EVPN
         Router's MAC Extended Community (as defined in Section 8.1 of
         [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-inter-subnet-forwarding]).

            Type = 3.  Length = 6 octets, value = the value field of
            EVPN Router's MAC Extended Community.

      *  For MPLS VPN case, the source address can be extracted from the
         Route Origin Community in BGP (as defined in Section 5 of
         [RFC4360]).

            Type = 4, Length = 6 octets, value = the value field of
            Route Origin Community.

   Note that if the Action component of an ORF entry specifies REMOVE-
   ALL, the ORF entry does not include the type-specific part.

   When the BGP ROUTE-REFRESH message carries RD-ORF entries, it must be
   set as follows:

   o  The ORF-Type MUST be set to RD-ORF.

   o  The AFI MUST be set to IPv4, IPv6, or Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN).

   o  If the AFI is set to IPv4 or IPv6, the SAFI MUST be set to MPLS-
      labeled VPN address.

   o  If the AFI is set to L2VPN, the SAFI MUST be set to BGP EVPN.

   o  The Match field MUST be equal to DENY.

5.  Application in single-domain scenario

   In scenario shown in Figure 1, When the VRF of VPN1 in PE1 overflows,
   it will find out the main source of VPN routes in this VRF, assuming
   it is PE3.  Then, PE1 will extract PE3's host address and source RD
   from BGP UPDATE message and generate a BGP ROUTE-REFRESH message
   contains a RD-ORF entry, and send it to RR.  The entry consists of
   the following fields:

   o  AFI is set to IPv4 , IPv6 or L2 VPN

   o  SAFI is set to "MPLS-labeled VPN address" or "BGP EVPN"

   o  When-to-refresh is set to IMMEDIATE

   o  ORF Type is set to RD-ORF

Internet-Draft                   RD-ORF                        July 2020


   o  Length of ORF entries depends on the type of Source Address sub-
      TLV (21, 23 or 33 octets)

   o  Action is set to ADD

   o  Match is set to DENY

   o  Sequence is set to 1

   o  Route Distinguisher is set to RD1

   o  Source Address sub-TLV is set to PE3's host address

   It noted that for a RD, the sequence of the first RD-ORF is equal to
   1.  When a PE needs to send a second RD-ORF entry associated with the
   same RD, the RD-ORF sequence SHOULD increment.

   When RR receives the ROUTE-REFRESH message, it checks <AFI/SAFI, ORF-
   Type, Sequence, Route Distinguisher, Source Address sub-TLV> to find
   whether it received the latest entry or not.  If not, RR will discard
   the entry; otherwise, RR will add the RD-ORF entry into its Adj-RIB-
   out, and regenerate a BGP ROUTE-REFRESH message to send this RD-ORF
   entry to PE3.

   After receiving this ROUTE-REFRESH message that carries a RD-ORF
   entry, PE3 will repeat the above process to check if it receives the
   latest entry.  If not, PE3 will discard it; otherwise, PE3 will add
   the RD-ORF entry into its Adj-RIB-out.

   Before sending a VPN route (the RD is equal to RD1) toward PE1, PE3
   will check its Adj-RIB-out and find the RD-ORF entry prevent it from
   sending VPN route which carries RD1 to RR.  Then, PE3 will stop
   sending that VPN route.

   When the VRF of VPN1 in PE1 no longer overflows, it will send RR a
   BGP ROUTE-REFRESH message encoded as following:

   o  AFI is set to IPv4 , IPv6 or L2 VPN

   o  SAFI is set to "MPLS-labeled VPN address" or "BGP EVPN"

   o  When-to-refresh is set to IMMEDIATE

   o  ORF Type is set to RD-ORF

   o  Length of ORF entries depends on the type of Source Address sub-
      TLV (21, 23 or 33 octets)

   o  Action is set to REMOVE

   o  Match is set to DENY

   o  Sequence is set to 2

   o  Route Distinguisher is set to RD1

   o  Source Address sub-TLV is set to PE3's host address

   After receiving the BGP ROUTE-REFRESH message, RR will check whether
   it receives the latest entry.  If not, RR will discard it; otherwise,
   RR will remove the associated RD-ORF entry from its Adj-RIB-out, and
   regenerate a BGP ROUTE-REFRESH message to send this RD-ORF entry to
   PE3.

   After receiving this ROUTE-REFRESH message that carries a RD-ORF
   entry, PE3 will repeat the above process to check if it receives the
   latest entry.  If not, PE3 will discard it; otherwise, PE3 will
   remove the associated RD-ORF entry from its Adj-RIB-out.

   Before sending a VPN route (the RD is equal to RD1) toward PE1, PE3
   will check its Adj-RIB-out and find there is no filter associated
   with RD1.  Then, it will send that VPN route.

              Figure 3: The Option B cross-domain scenario

   In this scenario, PE1 - PE4 are responsible for maintaining VPN
   routing information in AS1 and AS2.  There is a direct link between
   ASBR1 and ASBR2 via EBGP.  In AS1, PE1 and PE2 establish IBGP
   sessions with ASBR1 to ensure the routes can be transmitted in AS1.
   In AS2, PE3 and PE4 establish IBGP session with ASBR2.

   Due to the maintenance of VPN routes is only done by PEs.  ASBRs
   cannot know whether the PEs' ability to handle VPN routes has reached
   the upper limit or not, so it needs the RD-ORF to control the number
   of routes.

   Assume that PE1 - PE4 can transmit VPN routes through the network
   architecture shown in Figure 3.  When the VRF of VPN1 in PE1
   overflows, it will check and find out the main source of VPN routes
   in this VRF is PE3.  Then, PE1 will extract PE3's host address and
   source RD from BGP UPDATE message and generate a BGP ROUTE-REFRESH
   message contains a RD-ORF entry, and send it to ASBR1.  The entry
   consists of the following fields:

   o  AFI is set to IPv4 , IPv6 or L2 VPN

   o  SAFI is set to "MPLS-labeled VPN address" or "BGP EVPN"

   o  When-to-refresh is set to IMMEDIATE

   o  ORF Type is set to RD-ORF

   o  Match is set to DENY

   o  Sequence is set to 1

   o  Route Distinguisher is set to RD1

   o  Source Address sub-TLV is set to PE3's host address

   When ASBR1 receives the ROUTE-REFRESH message, it checks the <AFI/
   SAFI, ORF-Type, Sequence, Route Distinguisher, Source Address sub-
   TLV> to determine whether it receives the latest RD-ORF entry.  If
   not, ASBR1 will discard the entry; Otherwise, ASBR1 will add the RD-
   ORF entry into its Adj-RIB-out and regenerate a ROUTE-REFRESH message
   carries the RD-ORF entry to send it to ASBR2.

   After receiving the RD-ORF entry, ASBR2 will repeat the above process
   to check if it receives the latest entry.  If not, ASBR2 will discard
   it; otherwise, ASBR2 will add the RD-ORF entry into its Adj-RIB-out
   and send the entry to PE3.  PE3 will check it and add the associated
   entry into its Adj-RIB-out.

   Before sending a VPN route (the RD is equal to RD1) toward PE1, PE3
   will check its Adj-RIB-out and find the RD-ORF entry prevent it from
   sending VPN route which carries RD1 to ASBR2.  Then, it will stop
   sending that VPN route.

   If PE1 can re-receive the route entries, it will send a ROUTE-REFRESH
   message to ASBR1, carrying a RD-ORF entry consists of the following
   fields:

   In this scenario, PE1 and PE2 are responsible for maintaining VPN
   routing information in AS1 and AS2.  In order to reduce the
   complexity that full-mesh brings to the network, RR1 and RR2
   establish MP-EBGP session to transmit labeled routes.  In AS1, PE1
   and ASBR1 establish IBGP session with RR1 to ensure the routes can be
   transmitted in AS1.  In AS2, PE2 and ASBR2 establish IBGP session
   with RR2.

   Due to the maintenance of VPN routes is only done by PEs.  RRs cannot
   know whether the PEs' ability to handle VPN routes has reached the
   upper limit or not, so it needs the RD-ORF to control the number of
   routes.

   The operating mechanism of RD-ORF is similar to the description in
   Section 6.1.

7.  Security Considerations

   A BGP speaker will maintain the RD-ORF entries in Adj-RIB-out, this
   behavior consumes its memory and compute resources.  To avoid the
   excessive consumption of resources, [RFC5291] specifies that a BGP
   speaker can only accept ORF entries transmitted by its interested
   peers.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new Outbound Route Filter type - Route
   Distinguisher Outbound Route Filter (RD-ORF).  The code point is from
   the "BGP Outbound Route Filtering (ORF) Types".  It is recommended to
   set the code point of RD-ORF to 66.

   IANA is requested to allocate one code point for Source Address sub-
   TLV for RD-ORF.

   This document defines the following new RD-ORF sub-TLV types, which
   should be reflected in the Source Address sub-TLV for RD-ORF Code
   Point registry:
