1.  Introduction

   This document specifies:
      o the digital signature algorithm and parameters;
      o the hash algorithm and parameters;
      o the public and private key formats; and,
      o the signature format
   used by Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Certification
   Authorities (CA), and BGPsec (Border Gateway Protocol Security)
   speakers (i.e., routers).  CAs use these algorithms when processing
   requests for BGPsec Router Certificates [ID.sidr-bgpsec-pki-
   profiles].  BGPsec routers use these algorithms when requesting
   BGPsec certificates [ID.sidr-bgpsec-pki-profiles], signing BGPsec
   Update messages [ID.sidr-bgpsec-protocol], and verifying BGPsec
   Update messages [ID.sidr-bgpsec-protocol].

   This document is referenced by the BGPsec specification [ID.sidr-
   bgpsec-protocol] and the profile for BGPsec Router Certificates and
   Certification Requests [ID.sidr-bgpsec-pki-profiles].  Familiarity
   with these documents is assumed.  Implementers are reminded, however,
   that, as noted in Section 2 of [ID.sidr-bgpsec-pki-profiles], the
   algorithms used to sign CA Certificates, BGPsec Router Certificates,
   and CRLs are found in [ID.sidr-rfc6485bis].

   This document updates [ID.sidr-rfc6485bis] to add support for a) a
   different algorithm for BGPsec certificate requests, which are issued
   only by BGPsec speakers; b) a different Subject Public Key Info
   format for BGPsec certificates, which is needed for the specified

   BGPsec signature algorithm; and, c) a different signature format for
   BGPsec signatures, which is needed for the specified BGPsec signature
   algorithm.  The BGPsec certificate are differentiated from other RPKI
   certificates by the use of the BGPsec Extended Key Usage defined in
   [ID.sidr-bgpsec-pki-profiles].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Algorithms

   The algorithms used to compute signatures on CA certificates, BGPsec
   Router Certificates, and CRLs are as specified in Section 2 of
   [ID.sidr-rfc6485bis]. The remainder of this section addresses
   algorithms used when BGPsec routers request certificates, RPKI CAs
   verify BGPsec certification requests, BGPsec routers generate BGPsec
   Update messages, and when BGPsec routers verify BGPsec Update
   messages:

     o The signature algorithm used MUST be the Elliptic Curve Digital
       Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with curve P-256 [RFC6090][FIPS186].

     o The hash algorithm used MUST be SHA-256 [SHS].

   Hash algorithms are not identified by themselves in certificates or
   BGPsec Update messages. They are represented by an OID that combines
   the hash algorithm with the digital signature algorithm as follows:

     o The ecdsa-with-SHA256 OID [RFC5480] MUST appear in the PKCS #10
       signatureAlgorithm field [RFC2986] or in Certificate Request
       Message Format (CRMF) POPOSigningKey algorithm field [RFC4211],
       which location depends on the certificate request format
       generated.

     o In BGPsec Update messages, the ECDSA with SHA-256 Algorithm Suite
       Identifier from Section 7 is included in the Signature-Block
       List's Algorithm Suite Identifier field.

3.  Asymmetric Key Pair Formats

   The key formats used to compute signatures on CA certificates, BGPsec
   Router Certificates, and CRLs are as specified in Section 3 of
   [ID.sidr-rfc6485bis].  The remainder of this section addresses key
   formats found in the BGPsec router certificate requests and in BGPsec

   Router Certificates.

   The ECDSA private keys used to compute signatures for certificate
   requests and BGPsec Update messages MUST come from the P-256 curve
   [RFC5480].  The public key pair MUST use the uncompressed form.

3.1.  Public Key Format

   The Subject's public key is included in subjectPublicKeyInfo
   [RFC5280].  It has two sub-fields: algorithm and subjectPublicKey. 
   The values for the structures and their sub-structures follow:

     o algorithm (an AlgorithmIdentifier type):  The id-ecPublicKey OID
       MUST be used in the algorithm field, as specified in Section
       2.1.1 of [RFC5480].  The value for the associated parameters MUST
       be secp256r1, as specified in Section 2.1.1.1 of [RFC5480].

     o subjectPublicKey:  ECPoint MUST be used to encode the
       certificate's subjectPublicKey field, as specified in Section 2.2
       of [RFC5480].

3.2.  Private Key Format

   Local Policy determines private key format.

4.  Signature Format 

   The structure for the certificate's and CRL's signature field MUST be
   as specified in Section 4 of [ID.sidr-rfc6485bis], which is the same
   format used by other RPKI certificates.  The structure for the
   certification request's and BGPsec Update message's signature field
   MUST be as specified in Section 2.2.3 of [RFC3279].

5.  Additional Requirements

   It is anticipated that BGPsec will require the adoption of updated
   key sizes and a different set of signature and hash algorithms over
   time, in order to maintain an acceptable level of cryptographic
   security. This profile should be updated to specify such future
   requirements, when appropriate.

   CAs and RPs SHOULD be capable of supporting a transition to allow for
   the phased introduction of additional encryption algorithms and key
   specifications, and also accommodate the orderly deprecation of
   previously specified algorithms and keys [RFC6919].  Accordingly, CAs
   and RPs SHOULD be capable of supporting multiple RPKI algorithm and
   key profiles simultaneously within the scope of such anticipated
   transitions.  The recommended procedures to implement such a

Internet-Draft    BGPsec Algs, Key & Signature Formats November 10, 2015


   transition of key sizes and algorithms are not specified in this
   document, see Section 6 in [ID.sidr-bgpsec-protocol] for more
   information.

6.  Security Considerations 

   The Security Considerations of [RFC3279], [RFC5480], [RFC6090],
   [ID.sidr-rfc6485bis], and [ID.sidr-bgpsec-pki-profiles] apply to
   certificates.  The security considerations of [RFC3279], [RFC6090],
   [ID.sidr-rfc6485bis], [ID.sidr-bgpsec-pki-profiles] apply to
   certification requests.  The security considerations of [RFC3279],
   [ID.sidr-bgpsec-protocol], and [RFC6090] apply to BGPsec Update
   messages.  No new security considerations are introduced as a result
   of this specification.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is requested to define
   the "BGPsec Algorithm Suite Registry" described below.  

   An algorithm suite consists of a digest algorithm and a signature
   algorithm.  This specification creates an IANA registry of one-octet
   BGPsec algorithm suite identifiers.  Additionally, this document
   registers a single algorithm suite which uses the digest algorithm
   SHA-256 and the signature algorithm ECDSA on the P-256 curve
   [RFC5480].

                     BGPsec Algorithm Suites Registry

         Algorithm    Algorithm     Suite        Pointer

       | Reserved   | Reserved    | 0xF        | This draft    |
       +-------------------------------------------------------+

   Future assignments are to be made using either the Standards Action
   process defined in [RFC5226], or the Early IANA Allocation process
   defined in [RFC7120].  Assignments consist of a digest algorithm
   name, signature algorithm name, and the algorithm suite identifier
   value.
