                    IP Prefix Advertisement in EVPN
              draft-ietf-bess-evpn-prefix-advertisement-03


Abstract

   EVPN provides a flexible control plane that allows intra-subnet
   connectivity in an IP/MPLS and/or an NVO-based network. In NVO
   networks, there is also a need for a dynamic and efficient inter-
   subnet connectivity across Tenant Systems and End Devices that can be
   physical or virtual and may not support their own routing protocols.
   This document defines a new EVPN route type for the advertisement of
   IP Prefixes and explains some use-case examples where this new route-
   type is used.

   IRB: Integrated Routing and Bridging interface

   ML: MAC address length

   NVE: Network Virtualization Edge

   TS: Tenant System

   VA: Virtual Appliance

   Overlay index: object used in the IP Prefix route, as described in
   this document. It can be an IP address in the tenant space or an ESI,
   and identifies a pointer yielded by the IP route lookup at the
   routing context importing the route. An overlay index always needs a
   recursive route resolution on the NVE receiving the IP Prefix route,
   so that the NVE knows to which egress NVE it needs to forward the
   packets.  

   Underlay next-hop: IP address sent by BGP along with any EVPN route,
   i.e. BGP next-hop. It identifies the NVE sending the route and it is
   used at the receiving NVE as the VXLAN destination VTEP or NVGRE
   destination end-point.

   Ethernet NVO tunnel: it refers to Network Virtualization Overlay
   tunnels with Ethernet payload. Examples of this type of tunnels are
   VXLAN or nvGRE.

   with IP payload (no MAC header in the payload). Examples of IP NVO
   tunnels are VXLAN GPE or MPLSoGRE (both with IP payload). 

2. Introduction and problem statement

   Inter-subnet connectivity is required for certain tenants within the
   Data Center. [EVPN-INTERSUBNET] defines some fairly common inter-
   subnet forwarding scenarios where TSes can exchange packets with TSes
   located in remote subnets. In order to meet this requirement,
   [EVPN-INTERSUBNET] describes how MAC/IPs encoded in TS RT-2 routes
   are not only used to populate MAC-VRF and overlay ARP tables, but
   also IP-VRF tables with the encoded TS host routes (/32 or /128). In
   some cases, EVPN may advertise IP Prefixes and therefore provide
   aggregation in the IP-VRF tables, as opposed to program individual
   host routes. This document complements the scenarios described in
   [EVPN-INTERSUBNET] and defines how EVPN may be used to advertise IP
   Prefixes.

   Section 2.1 describes the inter-subnet connectivity requirements in
   Data Centers. Section 2.2 explains why a new EVPN route type is
   required for IP Prefix advertisements. Once the need for a new EVPN
   route type is justified, sections 3, 4 and 5 will describe this route
   type and how it is used in some specific use cases.  

2.1 Inter-subnet connectivity requirements in Data Centers

   [RFC7432] is used as the control plane for a Network Virtualization
   Overlay (NVO3) solution in Data Centers (DC), where Network
   Virtualization Edge (NVE) devices can be located in Hypervisors or
   TORs, as described in [EVPN-OVERLAY].

   If we use the term Tenant System (TS) to designate a physical or
   virtual system identified by MAC and IP addresses, and connected to
   an EVPN instance, the following considerations apply:

   o The Tenant Systems may be Virtual Machines (VMs) that generate
     traffic from their own MAC and IP.

   o The Tenant Systems may be Virtual Appliance entities (VAs) that
     forward traffic to/from IP addresses of different End Devices
     seating behind them.

        o These VAs can be firewalls, load balancers, NAT devices, other
          appliances or virtual gateways with virtual routing instances.

        o These VAs do not have their own routing protocols and hence
          rely on the EVPN NVEs to advertise the routes on their behalf.

        o In all these cases, the VA will forward traffic to the Data
          Center using its own source MAC but the source IP will be the
          one associated to the End Device seating behind or a
          translated IP address (part of a public NAT pool) if the VA is
          performing NAT.

        o Note that the same IP address could exist behind two of these
          TS. One example of this would be certain appliance resiliency
          mechanisms, where a virtual IP or floating IP can be owned by
          one of the two VAs running the resiliency protocol (the master
          VA). VRRP is one particular example of this. Another example
          is multi-homed subnets, i.e. the same subnet is connected to
          two VAs.

        o Although these VAs provide IP connectivity to VMs and subnets
          behind them, they do not always have their own IP interface
          connected to the EVPN NVE, e.g. layer-2 firewalls are examples
          of VAs not supporting IP interfaces.

   The following figure illustrates some of the examples described
   above.

   Where:

   NVE1, NVE2, NVE3, NVE4, NVE5, DGW1 and DGW2 share the same EVI for a
   particular tenant. EVI-10 is comprised of the collection of MAC-VRF10
   instances defined in all the NVEs. All the hosts connected to EVI-10
   belong to the same IP subnet. The hosts connected to EVI-10 are
   listed below:

        o TS1 is a VM that generates/receives traffic from/to IP1, where
          IP1 belongs to the EVI-10 subnet.

        o TS2 and TS3 are Virtual Appliances (VA) that generate/receive
          traffic from/to the subnets and hosts seating behind them
          (SN1, SN2, SN3, IP4 and IP5). Their IP addresses (IP2 and IP3)
          belong to the EVI-10 subnet and they can also generate/receive
          traffic. When these VAs receive packets destined to their own
          MAC addresses (M2 and M3) they will route the packets to the

          proper subnet or host. These VAs do not support routing
          protocols to advertise the subnets connected to them and can
          move to a different server and NVE when the Cloud Management
          System decides to do so. These VAs may also support redundancy
          mechanisms for some subnets, similar to VRRP, where a floating
          IP is owned by the master VA and only the master VA forwards
          traffic to a given subnet. E.g.: vIP23 in figure 1 is a
          floating IP that can be owned by TS2 or TS3 depending on who
          the master is. Only the master will forward traffic to SN1.  

        o Integrated Routing and Bridging interfaces IRB1, IRB2 and IRB3
          have their own IP addresses that belong to the EVI-10 subnet
          too. These IRB interfaces connect the EVI-10 subnet to Virtual
          Routing and Forwarding (IP-VRF) instances that can route the
          traffic to other connected subnets for the same tenant (within
          the DC or at the other end of the WAN).

        o TS4 is a layer-2 VA that provides connectivity to subnets SN5,
          SN6 and SN7, but does not have an IP address itself in the
          EVI-10. TS4 is connected to a physical port on NVE5 assigned
          to Ethernet Segment Identifier 4.

   All the above DC use cases require inter-subnet forwarding and
   therefore the individual host routes and subnets: 

   a) MUST be advertised from the NVEs (since VAs and VMs do not run
      routing protocols) and
   b) MAY be associated to an overlay index that can be a VA IP address,
      a floating IP address or an ESI.  


2.2 The requirement for a new EVPN route type   

   [RFC7432] defines a MAC/IP route (also referred as RT-2) where a MAC
   address can be advertised together with an IP address length (IPL)
   and IP address (IP). While a variable IPL might have been used to
   indicate the presence of an IP prefix in a route type 2, there are
   several specific use cases in which using this route type to deliver
   IP Prefixes is not suitable.

   One example of such use cases is the "floating IP" example described
   in section 2.1. In this example we need to decouple the advertisement
   of the prefixes from the advertisement of the floating IP (vIP23 in
   figure 1) and MAC associated to it, otherwise the solution gets
   highly inefficient and does not scale. 

   E.g.: if we are advertising 1k prefixes from M2 (using RT-2) and the
   floating IP owner changes from M2 to M3, we would need to withdraw 1k

Internet-Draft         EVPN Prefix Advertisement      September 13, 2016


   routes from M2 and re-advertise 1k routes from M3. However if we use
   a separate route type, we can advertise the 1k routes associated to
   the floating IP address (vIP23) and only one RT-2 for advertising the
   ownership of the floating IP, i.e. vIP23 and M2 in the route type 2.
   When the floating IP owner changes from M2 to M3, a single RT-2
   withdraw/update is required to indicate the change. The remote DGW
   will not change any of the 1k prefixes associated to vIP23, but will
   only update the ARP resolution entry for vIP23 (now pointing at M3).

   Other reasons to decouple the IP Prefix advertisement from the MAC/IP
   route are listed below:

        o Clean identification, operation of troubleshooting of IP
          Prefixes, not subject to interpretation and independent of the
          IPL and the IP value. E.g.: a default IP route 0.0.0.0/0 must
          always be easily and clearly distinguished from the absence of
          IP information.

        o MAC address information must not be compared by BGP when
          selecting two IP Prefix routes. If IP Prefixes were to be
          advertised using MAC/IP routes, the MAC information would
          always be present and part of the route key. 

        o IP Prefix routes must not be subject to MAC/IP route
          procedures such as MAC mobility or aliasing. Prefixes
          advertised from two different ESIs do not mean mobility; MACs
          advertised from two different ESIs do mean mobility. Similarly
          load balancing for IP prefixes is achieved through IP
          mechanisms such as ECMP, and not through MAC route mechanisms
          such as aliasing.

        o NVEs that do not require processing IP Prefixes must have an
          easy way to identify an update with an IP Prefix and ignore
          it, rather than processing the MAC/IP route to find out only
          later that it carries a Prefix that must be ignored.

   The following sections describe how EVPN is extended with a new route
   type for the advertisement of IP prefixes and how this route is used
   to address the current and future inter-subnet connectivity
   requirements existing in the Data Center.

3. The BGP EVPN IP Prefix route

   The current BGP EVPN NLRI as defined in [RFC7432] is shown below:

   Where the route type field can contain one of the following specific
   values:

   + 1 - Ethernet Auto-Discovery (A-D) route

   + 2 - MAC/IP advertisement route

   + 3 - Inclusive Multicast Route

   This document defines an additional route type that will be used for
   the advertisement of IP Prefixes:

   + 5 - IP Prefix Route

   The support for this new route type is OPTIONAL. 

   Since this new route type is OPTIONAL, an implementation not
   supporting it MUST ignore the route, based on the unknown route type
   value.

   The detailed encoding of this route and associated procedures are
   described in the following sections.

    +---------------------------------------+
    |      RD   (8 octets)                  |
    +---------------------------------------+
    |Ethernet Segment Identifier (10 octets)|
    +---------------------------------------+
    |  Ethernet Tag ID (4 octets)           |
    +---------------------------------------+
    |  IP Prefix Length (1 octet)           |

    +---------------------------------------+

   Where:

        o RD, Ethernet Tag ID and MPLS Label fields will be used as
          defined in [RFC7432] and [EVPN-OVERLAY].

        o The Ethernet Segment Identifier will be a non-zero 10-byte
          identifier if the ESI is used as an overlay index. It will be
          zero otherwise. 

        o The IP Prefix Length can be set to a value between 0 and 32
          (bits) for ipv4 and between 0 and 128 for ipv6.

        o The IP Prefix will be a 32 or 128-bit field (ipv4 or ipv6).

        o The GW IP (Gateway IP Address) will be a 32 or 128-bit field
          (ipv4 or ipv6), and will encode an overlay IP index for the IP
          Prefixes. The GW IP field SHOULD be zero if it is not used as
          an overlay index.

        o The MPLS Label field is encoded as 3 octets, where the high-
          order 20 bits contain the label value. The value SHOULD be
          null when the IP Prefix route is used for a recursive lookup
          resolution.

        o The total route length will indicate the type of prefix (ipv4
          or ipv6) and the type of GW IP address (ipv4 or ipv6). Note
          that the IP Prefix + the GW IP should have a length of either
          64 or 256 bits, but never 160 bits (ipv4 and ipv6 mixed values
          are not allowed).

   The Eth-Tag ID, IP Prefix Length and IP Prefix will be part of the
   route key used by BGP to compare routes. The rest of the fields will

   not be part of the route key. 

   The route will contain a single overlay index at most, i.e. if the
   ESI field is different from zero, the GW IP field will be zero, and
   vice versa. The following table shows the different inter-subnet use-
   cases described in this document and the corresponding coding of the
   overlay index in the route type 5 (RT-5). The IP-VRF-to-IP-VRF or IRB
   forwarding on NVEs case is a special use-case, where there may be no
   need for overlay index, since the actual next-hop is given by the BGP
   next-hop. When an overlay index is present in the RT-5, the receiving
   NVE will need to perform a recursive route resolution to find out to
   which egress NVE to forward the packets.

4. Benefits of using the EVPN IP Prefix route 

   This section clarifies the different functions accomplished by the
   EVPN RT-2 and RT-5 routes, and provides a list of benefits derived
   from using a separate route type for the advertisement of IP Prefixes
   in EVPN. 

   [RFC7432] describes the content of the BGP EVPN RT-2 specific NLRI,
   i.e. MAC/IP Advertisement Route, where the IP address length (IPL)
   and IP address (IP) of a specific advertised MAC are encoded. The
   subject of the MAC advertisement route is the MAC address (M) and MAC
   address length (ML) encoded in the route. The MAC mobility and other
   procedures are defined around that MAC address. The IP address
   information carries the host IP address required for the ARP
   resolution of the MAC according to [RFC7432] and the host route to be
   programmed in the IP-VRF [EVPN-INTERSUBNET].

   The BGP EVPN route type 5 defined in this document, i.e. IP Prefix
   Advertisement route, decouples the advertisement of IP prefixes from
   the advertisement of any MAC address related to it. This brings some
   major benefits to NVO-based networks where certain inter-subnet
   forwarding scenarios are required. Some of those benefits are:

   a) Upon receiving a route type 2 or type 5, an egress NVE can easily
 


Rabadan et al.           Expires March 17, 2017                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft         EVPN Prefix Advertisement      September 13, 2016


      distinguish MACs and IPs from IP Prefixes. E.g. an IP prefix with
      IPL=32 being advertised from two different ingress NVEs (as RT-5)
      can be identified as such and be imported in the designated
      routing context as two ECMP routes, as opposed to two MACs
      competing for the same IP.

   b) Similarly, upon receiving a route, an ingress NVE not supporting
      processing of IP Prefixes can easily ignore the update, based on
      the route type.

   c) A MAC route includes the ML, M, IPL and IP in the route key that
      is used by BGP to compare routes, whereas for IP Prefix routes,
      only IPL and IP (as well as Ethernet Tag ID) are part of the route
      key. Advertised IP Prefixes are imported into the designated
      routing context, where there is no MAC information associated to
      IP routes. In the example illustrated in figure 1, subnet SN1
      should be advertised by NVE2 and NVE3 and interpreted by DGW1 as
      the same route coming from two different next-hops, regardless of
      the MAC address associated to TS2 or TS3. This is easily
      accomplished in the RT-5 by including only the IP information in
      the route key.

   d) By decoupling the MAC from the IP Prefix advertisement procedures,
      we can leave the IP Prefix advertisements out of the MAC mobility
      procedures defined in [RFC7432] for MACs. In addition, this allows
      us to have an indirection mechanism for IP Prefixes advertised
      from a MAC/IP that can move between hypervisors. E.g. if there are
      1,000 prefixes seating behind TS2 (figure 1), NVE2 will advertise
      all those prefixes in RT-5 routes associated to the overlay index
      IP2. Should TS2 move to a different NVE, a single MAC/IP
      advertisement route withdraw for the M2/IP2 route from NVE2 will
      invalidate the 1,000 prefixes, as opposed to have to wait for each
      individual prefix to be withdrawn. This may be easily accomplished
      by using IP Prefix routes that are not tied to a MAC address, and
      use a different MAC/IP route to advertise the location and
      resolution of the overlay index to a MAC address.

5. IP Prefix overlay index use-cases

   The IP Prefix route can use a GW IP or an ESI as an overlay index as
   well as no overlay index whatsoever. This section describes some use-
   cases for these index types.

5.1 TS IP address overlay index use-case 

   The following figure illustrates an example of inter-subnet
   forwarding for subnets seating behind Virtual Appliances (on TS2 and
   TS3).

                  Figure 2 TS IP address use-case

   An example of inter-subnet forwarding between subnet SN1/24 and a
   subnet seating in the WAN is described below. NVE2, NVE3, DGW1 and
   DGW2 are running BGP EVPN. TS2 and TS3 do not support routing
   protocols, only a static route to forward the traffic to the WAN.

   (1) NVE2 advertises the following BGP routes on behalf of TS2:

        o Route type 2 (MAC/IP route) containing: ML=48, M=M2, IPL=32,
          IP=IP2 and [RFC5512] BGP Encapsulation Extended Community with
          the corresponding Tunnel-type.

        o Route type 5 (IP Prefix route) containing: IPL=24, IP=SN1,
          ESI=0, GW IP address=IP2.

   (2) NVE3 advertises the following BGP routes on behalf of TS3:

        o Route type 2 (MAC/IP route) containing: ML=48, M=M3, IPL=32,
          IP=IP3 (and BGP Encapsulation Extended Community).

        o Route type 5 (IP Prefix route) containing: IPL=24, IP=SN1,
          ESI=0, GW IP address=IP3.

   (3) DGW1 and DGW2 import both received routes based on the
       route-targets:

        o Based on the MAC-VRF10 route-target in DGW1 and DGW2, the
          MAC/IP route is imported and M2 is added to the MAC-VRF10
          along with its corresponding tunnel information. For instance,
          if VXLAN is used, the VTEP will be derived from the MAC/IP
          route BGP next-hop (underlay next-hop) and VNI from the MPLS
          Label1 field. IP2 - M2 is added to the ARP table.

Internet-Draft         EVPN Prefix Advertisement      September 13, 2016


        o Based on the MAC-VRF10 route-target in DGW1 and DGW2, the IP
          Prefix route is also imported and SN1/24 is added to the IP-
          VRF with overlay index IP2 pointing at the local MAC-VRF10.
          Should ECMP be enabled in the IP-VRF, SN1/24 would also be
          added to the routing table with overlay index IP3.

   (4) When DGW1 receives a packet from the WAN with destination IPx,
       where IPx belongs to SN1/24:

        o A destination IP lookup is performed on the DGW1 IP-VRF
          routing table and overlay index=IP2 is found. Since IP2 is an
          overlay index a recursive route resolution is required for
          IP2.

        o IP2 is resolved to M2 in the ARP table, and M2 is resolved to
          the tunnel information given by the MAC-VRF FIB (e.g. remote
          VTEP and VNI for the VXLAN case).

        o The IP packet destined to IPx is encapsulated with:

             . Source inner MAC = IRB1 MAC.

             . Destination inner MAC = M2.

             . Tunnel information provided by the MAC-VRF (VNI, VTEP IPs
               and MACs for the VXLAN case).

   (5) When the packet arrives at NVE2:

        o Based on the tunnel information (VNI for the VXLAN case), the
          MAC-VRF10 context is identified for a MAC lookup.

        o Encapsulation is stripped-off and based on a MAC lookup
          (assuming MAC forwarding on the egress NVE), the packet is
          forwarded to TS2, where it will be properly routed.

   (6) Should TS2 move from NVE2 to NVE3, MAC Mobility procedures will
       be applied to the MAC route IP2/M2, as defined in [RFC7432].
       Route type 5 prefixes are not subject to MAC mobility procedures,
       hence no changes in the DGW IP-VRF routing table will occur for
       TS2 mobility, i.e. all the prefixes will still be pointing at IP2
       as overlay index. There is an indirection for e.g. SN1/24, which
       still points at overlay index IP2 in the routing table, but IP2
       will be simply resolved to a different tunnel, based on the
       outcome of the MAC mobility procedures for the MAC/IP route
       IP2/M2.

   Note that in the opposite direction, TS2 will send traffic based on

   its static-route next-hop information (IRB1 and/or IRB2), and regular
   EVPN procedures will be applied.

5.2 Floating IP overlay index use-case 

   Sometimes Tenant Systems (TS) work in active/standby mode where an
   upstream floating IP - owned by the active TS - is used as the
   overlay index to get to some subnets behind. This redundancy mode,
   already introduced in section 2.1 and 2.2, is illustrated in Figure
   3.

            Figure 3 Floating IP overlay index for redundant TS

   In this example, assuming TS2 is the active TS and owns IP23:

   (1) NVE2 advertises the following BGP routes for TS2:

        o Route type 2 (MAC/IP route) containing: ML=48, M=M2, IPL=32,
          IP=IP23 (and BGP Encapsulation Extended Community).

        o Route type 5 (IP Prefix route) containing: IPL=24, IP=SN1,
          ESI=0, GW IP address=IP23.

   (2) NVE3 advertises the following BGP routes for TS3:

        o Route type 5 (IP Prefix route) containing: IPL=24, IP=SN1,
          ESI=0, GW IP address=IP23.

   (3) DGW1 and DGW2 import both received routes based on the route-
       target:

        o M2 is added to the MAC-VRF10 FIB along with its corresponding
          tunnel information. For the VXLAN use case, the VTEP will be
          derived from the MAC/IP route BGP next-hop and VNI from the

          VNI/VSID field. IP23 - M2 is added to the ARP table.

        o SN1/24 is added to the IP-VRF in DGW1 and DGW2 with overlay
          index IP23 pointing at the local MAC-VRF10.

   (4) When DGW1 receives a packet from the WAN with destination IPx,
       where IPx belongs to SN1/24:

        o A destination IP lookup is performed on the DGW1 IP-VRF
          routing table and overlay index=IP23 is found. Since IP23 is
          an overlay index, a recursive route resolution for IP23 is
          required.

        o IP23 is resolved to M2 in the ARP table, and M2 is resolved to
          the tunnel information given by the MAC-VRF (remote VTEP and
          VNI for the VXLAN case).

        o The IP packet destined to IPx is encapsulated with:

             . Source inner MAC = IRB1 MAC.

             . Destination inner MAC = M2.

             . Tunnel information provided by the MAC-VRF FIB (VNI, VTEP
               IPs and MACs for the VXLAN case).

   (5) When the packet arrives at NVE2:

        o Based on the tunnel information (VNI for the VXLAN case), the
          MAC-VRF10 context is identified for a MAC lookup.

        o Encapsulation is stripped-off and based on a MAC lookup
          (assuming MAC forwarding on the egress NVE), the packet is
          forwarded to TS2, where it will be properly routed.

   (6) When the redundancy protocol running between TS2 and TS3 appoints
       TS3 as the new active TS for SN1, TS3 will now own the floating
       IP23 and will signal this new ownership (GARP message or
       similar). Upon receiving the new owner's notification, NVE3 will
       issue a route type 2 for M3-IP23. DGW1 and DGW2 will update their
       ARP tables with the new MAC resolving the floating IP. No changes
       are carried out in the IP-VRF routing table.

5.3 ESI overlay index ("Bump in the wire") use-case

   Figure 5 illustrates an example of inter-subnet forwarding for an IP
   Prefix route that carries a subnet SN1 and uses an ESI as an overlay
   index (ESI23). In this use-case, TS2 and TS3 are layer-2 VA devices

   without any IP address that can be included as an overlay index in
   the GW IP field of the IP Prefix route. Their MAC addresses are M2
   and M3 respectively and are connected to EVI-10. Note that IRB1 and
   IRB2 (in DGW1 and DGW2 respectively) have IP addresses in a subnet
   different than SN1.

                    Figure 5 ESI overlay index use-case

   Since neither TS2 nor TS3 can run any routing protocol and have no IP
   address assigned, an ESI, i.e. ESI23, will be provisioned on the
   attachment ports of NVE2 and NVE3. This model supports VA redundancy
   in a similar way as the one described in section 5.2 for the floating
   IP overlay index use-case, only using the EVPN Ethernet A-D route
   instead of the MAC advertisement route to advertise the location of
   the overlay index. The procedure is explained below:

   (1) NVE2 advertises the following BGP routes for TS2:

        o Route type 1 (Ethernet A-D route for EVI-10) containing:

        o Route type 5 (IP Prefix route) containing: IPL=24, IP=SN1,
          ESI=ESI23, GW IP address=0. The Router's MAC Extended
          Community defined in [EVPN-INTERSUBNET] is added and carries
          the MAC address (M2) associated to the TS behind which SN1
          seats.

   (2) NVE3 advertises the following BGP routes for TS3:

        o Route type 1 (Ethernet A-D route for EVI-10) containing:
          ESI=ESI23 and the corresponding tunnel information (VNI/VSID

          field), as well as the BGP Encapsulation Extended Community. 

        o Route type 5 (IP Prefix route) containing: IPL=24, IP=SN1,
          ESI=23, GW IP address=0. The Router's MAC Extended Community
          is added and carries the MAC address (M3) associated to the TS
          behind which SN1 seats.

   (3) DGW1 and DGW2 import the received routes based on the route-
       target:

        o The tunnel information to get to ESI23 is installed in DGW1
          and DGW2. For the VXLAN use case, the VTEP will be derived
          from the Ethernet A-D route BGP next-hop and VNI from the
          VNI/VSID field (see [EVPN-OVERLAY]). 

        o SN1/24 is added to the IP-VRF in DGW1 and DGW2 with overlay
          index ESI23.

   (4) When DGW1 receives a packet from the WAN with destination IPx,
       where IPx belongs to SN1/24:

        o A destination IP lookup is performed on the DGW1 IP-VRF
          routing table and overlay index=ESI23 is found. Since ESI23 is
          an overlay index, a recursive route resolution is required to
          find the egress NVE where ESI23 resides.

        o The IP packet destined to IPx is encapsulated with:

             . Source inner MAC = IRB1 MAC.

             . Destination inner MAC = M2 (this MAC will be obtained
               from the Router's MAC Extended Community received along
               with the RT-5 for SN1).

             . Tunnel information for the NVO tunnel is provided by the
               Ethernet A-D route per-EVI for ESI23 (VNI and VTEP IP for
               the VXLAN case).

   (5) When the packet arrives at NVE2:

        o Based on the tunnel demultiplexer information (VNI for the
          VXLAN case), the MAC-VRF10 context is identified for a MAC
          lookup (assuming MAC disposition model) or the VNI MAY
          directly identify the egress interface (for a label or VNI
          disposition model).

        o Encapsulation is stripped-off and based on a MAC lookup
          (assuming MAC forwarding on the egress NVE) or a VNI lookup

          (in case of VNI forwarding), the packet is forwarded to TS2,
          where it will be forwarded to SN1.

   (6) If the redundancy protocol running between TS2 and TS3 follows an
       active/standby model and there is a failure, appointing TS3 as
       the new active TS for SN1, TS3 will now own the connectivity to
       SN1 and will signal this new ownership. Upon receiving the new
       owner's notification, NVE3's AC will become active and issue a
       route type 1 for ESI23, whereas NVE2 will withdraw its Ethernet
       A-D route for ESI23. DGW1 and DGW2 will update their tunnel
       information to resolve ESI23. The destination inner MAC will be
       changed to M3.

5.4 IP-VRF-to-IP-VRF model

   This use-case is similar to the scenario described in "IRB forwarding
   on NVEs for Tenant Systems" in [EVPN-INTERSUBNET], however the new
   requirement here is the advertisement of IP Prefixes as opposed to
   only host routes. 

   In the examples described in sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, the MAC-VRF
   instance can connect IRB interfaces and any other Tenant Systems
   connected to it. EVPN provides connectivity for:

   1. Traffic destined to the IRB IP interfaces as well as

   2. Traffic destined to IP subnets seating behind the TS, e.g. SN1 or
      SN2.

   In order to provide connectivity for (1), MAC/IP routes (RT-2) are
   needed so that IRB MACs and IPs can be distributed. Connectivity type
   (2) is accomplished by the exchange of IP Prefix routes (RT-5) for
   IPs and subnets seating behind certain overlay indexes, e.g. GW IP or
   ESI.

   In some cases, IP Prefix routes may be advertised for subnets and IPs
   seating behind an IRB. We refer to this use-case as the "IP-VRF-to-
   IP-VRF" model. 

   [EVPN-INTERSUBNET] defines an asymmetric IRB model and a symmetric
   IRB model, based on the required lookups at the ingress and egress
   NVE: the asymmetric model requires an ip-lookup and a mac-lookup at
   the ingress NVE, whereas only a mac-lookup is needed at the egress
   NVE; the symmetric model requires ip and mac lookups at both, ingress
   and egress NVE. From that perspective, the IP-VRF-to-IP-VRF use-case
   described in this section is a symmetric IRB model. Note that in an
   IP-VRF-to-IP-VRF scenario, a PE may not be configured with any MAC-
   VRF for a given tenant, in which case it will only be doing IP

   lookups and forwarding for that tenant.

   Based on the way the IP-VRFs are interconnected, there are three
   different IP-VRF-to-IP-VRF scenarios identified and described in this
   document:

   1) Interface-less model
   2) Interface-full with core-facing IRB model
   3) Interface-full with unnumbered core-facing IRB model


5.4.1 Interface-less IP-VRF-to-IP-VRF model

   Figure 6 will be used for the description of this model.

         Figure 6 Interface-less IP-VRF-to-IP-VRF model

   In this case, the requirements are the following:

   a) The NVEs and DGWs must provide connectivity between hosts in SN1,
      SN2, IP1 and hosts seating at the other end of the WAN.

   b) The IP-VRF instances in the NVE/DGWs are directly connected
      through NVO tunnels, and no IRBs and/or MAC-VRF instances are
      defined at the core.

   c) The solution must provide layer-3 connectivity among the IP-VRFs
      for Ethernet NVO tunnels, for instance, VXLAN or nvGRE.

   d) The solution may provide layer-3 connectivity among the IP-VRFs
      for IP NVO tunnels, for example, VXLAN GPE (with IP payload).

   In order to meet the above requirements, the EVPN route type 5 will
   be used to advertise the IP Prefixes, along with the Router's MAC
   Extended Community as defined in [EVPN-INTERSUBNET] if the
   advertising NVE/DGW uses Ethernet NVO tunnels. Each NVE/DGW will
   advertise an RT-5 for each of its prefixes with the following fields:

        o RD as per [RFC7432].

        o Eth-Tag ID=0 assuming VLAN-based service.

        o IP address length and IP address, as explained in the previous
          sections.

        o GW IP address= SHOULD be set to 0.

        o ESI=0

        o MPLS label or VNI corresponding to the IP-VRF.

   Each RT-5 will be sent with a route-target identifying the tenant
   (IP-VRF) and two BGP extended communities:

        o The first one is the BGP Encapsulation Extended Community, as
          per [RFC5512], identifying the tunnel type.

        o The second one is the Router's MAC Extended Community as per
          [EVPN-INTERSUBNET] containing the MAC address associated to
          the NVE advertising the route. This MAC address identifies the
          NVE/DGW and MAY be re-used for all the IP-VRFs in the NVE. The
          Router's MAC Extended Community MUST be sent if the route is
          associated to an Ethernet NVO tunnel, for instance, VXLAN. If
          the route is associated to an IP NVO tunnel, for instance
          VXLAN GPE with IP payload, the Router's MAC Extended Community
          SHOULD NOT be sent.

   The following example illustrates the procedure to advertise and
   forward packets to SN1/24 (ipv4 prefix advertised from NVE1) for
   VXLAN tunnels:

   (1) NVE1 advertises the following BGP route:

        o Route type 5 (IP Prefix route) containing:

          . IPL=24, IP=SN1, VNI=10.

          . GW IP= SHOULD be set to 0.

          . [RFC5512] BGP Encapsulation Extended Community with Tunnel-
            type=VXLAN.

          . Router's MAC Extended Community that contains M1.

          . Route-target identifying the tenant (IP-VRF).

   (2) DGW1 imports the received routes from NVE1:

        o DGW1 installs SN1/24 in the IP-VRF identified by the RT-5
          route-target.

        o Since GW IP=0 and the VNI is a valid value, DGW1 will use the
          VNI and next-hop of the RT-5, as well as the MAC address
          conveyed in the Router's MAC Extended Community (as inner
          destination MAC address) to encapsulate the routed IP packets.

   (3) When DGW1 receives a packet from the WAN with destination IPx,
       where IPx belongs to SN1/24:

        o A destination IP lookup is performed on the DGW1 IP-VRF
          routing table. The lookup yields SN1/24.

        o Since the RT-5 for SN1/24 had a GW IP=0 and a valid VNI and
          next-hop (used as destination VTEP), DGW1 will not need a
          recursive lookup to resolve the route.

        o The IP packet destined to IPx is encapsulated with: Source
          inner MAC = DGW1 MAC, Destination inner MAC = M1, Source outer
          IP (source VTEP) = DGW1 IP, Destination outer IP (destination
          VTEP) = NVE1 IP.

   (4) When the packet arrives at NVE1:

        o NVE1 will identify the IP-VRF for an IP-lookup based on the
          VNI.

        o An IP lookup is performed in the routing context, where SN1
          turns out to be a local subnet associated to MAC-VRF2. A
          subsequent lookup in the ARP table and the MAC-VRF FIB will
          provide the forwarding information for the packet in MAC-VRF2.

   The implementation of this Interface-less model is REQUIRED.

         Figure 7 Interface-full with core-facing IRB model

   In this model, the requirements are the following: 

   a) As in section 5.4.1, the NVEs and DGWs must provide connectivity
      between hosts in SN1, SN2, IP1 and hosts seating at the other end
      of the WAN.

   b) However, the NVE/DGWs are now connected through Ethernet NVO
      tunnels terminated in core-MAC-VRF instances. The IP-VRFs use IRB
      interfaces for their connectivity to the core MAC-VRFs.

   c) Each core-facing IRB has an IP and a MAC address, where the IP
      address must be reachable from other NVEs or DGWs. 

   d) The core EVI is composed of the NVE/DGW MAC-VRFs and may contain
      other MAC-VRFs without IRB interfaces. Those non-IRB MAC-VRFs will
      typically connect TSes that need layer-3 connectivity to remote
      subnets.

   e) The solution must provide layer-3 connectivity for Ethernet NVO
      tunnels, for instance, VXLAN or nvGRE.

   EVPN type 5 routes will be used to advertise the IP Prefixes, whereas

   EVPN RT-2 routes will advertise the MAC/IP addresses of each core-
   facing IRB interface. Each NVE/DGW will advertise an RT-5 for each of
   its prefixes with the following fields:

        o RD as per [RFC7432].

        o Eth-Tag ID=0 assuming VLAN-based service.

        o IP address length and IP address, as explained in the previous
          sections.

        o GW IP address=IRB-IP (this is the overlay index that will be
          used for the recursive route resolution).

        o ESI=0

        o MPLS label or VNI corresponding to the IP-VRF. Note that the
          value SHOULD be zero since the RT-5 route requires a recursive
          lookup resolution to an RT-2 route. The MPLS label or VNI to
          be used when forwarding packets will be derived from the RT-
          2's MPLS Label1 field.

   Each RT-5 will be sent with a route-target identifying the tenant
   (IP-VRF). The Router's MAC Extended Community SHOULD NOT be sent in
   this case.

   The following example illustrates the procedure to advertise and
   forward packets to SN1/24 (ipv4 prefix advertised from NVE1) for
   VXLAN tunnels:

   (1) NVE1 advertises the following BGP routes:

        o Route type 5 (IP Prefix route) containing:

          . IPL=24, IP=SN1, VNI= SHOULD be set to 0.

          . GW IP=IP1 (core-facing IRB's IP)

          . Route-target identifying the tenant (IP-VRF).

        o Route type 2 (MAC/IP route for the core-facing IRB)
          containing:

          . ML=48, M=M1, IPL=32, IP=IP1, VNI=10.

          . A [RFC5512] BGP Encapsulation Extended Community with
            Tunnel-type= VXLAN.

          . Route-target identifying the tenant. This route-target MAY
            be the same as the one used with the RT-5.

   (2) DGW1 imports the received routes from NVE1:

        o DGW1 installs SN1/24 in the IP-VRF identified by the RT-5
          route-target.

          . Since GW IP is different from zero, the GW IP (IP1) will be
            used as the overlay index for the recursive route resolution
            to the RT-2 carrying IP1.

   (3) When DGW1 receives a packet from the WAN with destination IPx,
       where IPx belongs to SN1/24:

        o A destination IP lookup is performed on the DGW1 IP-VRF
          routing table. The lookup yields SN1/24, which is associated
          to the overlay index IP1. The forwarding information is
          derived from the RT-2 received for IP1.

        o The IP packet destined to IPx is encapsulated with: Source
          inner MAC = M3, Destination inner MAC = M1, Source outer IP
          (source VTEP) = DGW1 IP, Destination outer IP (destination
          VTEP) = NVE1 IP.

   (4) When the packet arrives at NVE1:

        o NVE1 will identify the IP-VRF for an IP-lookup based on the
          VNI and the inner MAC DA.

        o An IP lookup is performed in the routing context, where SN1
          turns out to be a local subnet associated to MAC-VRF2. A
          subsequent lookup in the ARP table and the MAC-VRF FIB will
          provide the forwarding information for the packet in MAC-VRF2.

   The implementation of the Interface-full with core-facing IRB model
   is REQUIRED.


5.4.3 Interface-full IP-VRF-to-IP-VRF with unnumbered core-facing IRB

   Figure 8 will be used for the description of this model. Note that
   this model is similar to the one described in section 5.4.2, only

         Figure 8 Interface-full with unnumbered core-facing IRB model

   In this model, the requirements are the following: 

   a) As in section 5.4.1 and 5.4.2, the NVEs and DGWs must provide
      connectivity between hosts in SN1, SN2, IP1 and hosts seating at
      the other end of the WAN.

   b) As in section 5.4.2, the NVE/DGWs are connected through Ethernet
      NVO tunnels terminated in core-MAC-VRF instances. The IP-VRFs use
      IRB interfaces for their connectivity to the core MAC-VRFs.

   c) However, each core-facing IRB has a MAC address only, and no IP
      address (that is why the model refers to an 'unnumbered' core-
      facing IRB). In this model, there is no need to have IP
      reachability to the core-facing IRB interfaces themselves and
      there is a requirement to save IP addresses on those interfaces.

   d) As in section 5.4.2, the core EVI is composed of the NVE/DGW MAC-
      VRFs and may contain other MAC-VRFs. 

   e) As in section 5.4.2, the solution must provide layer-3
      connectivity for Ethernet NVO tunnels, for instance, VXLAN or
      nvGRE.

   This model will also make use of the RT-5 recursive resolution. EVPN
   type 5 routes will advertise the IP Prefixes along with the Router's
   MAC Extended Community used for the recursive lookup, whereas EVPN
   RT-2 routes will advertise the MAC addresses of each core-facing IRB

   interface (this time without an IP). Each NVE/DGW will advertise an
   RT-5 for each of its prefixes with the following fields:

        o RD as per [RFC7432].

        o Eth-Tag ID=0 assuming VLAN-based service.

        o IP address length and IP address, as explained in the previous
          sections.

        o GW IP address= SHOULD be set to 0.

        o ESI=0

        o MPLS label or VNI corresponding to the IP-VRF. Note that the
          value SHOULD be zero since the RT-5 route requires a recursive
          lookup resolution to an RT-2 route. The MPLS label or VNI to
          be used when forwarding packets will be derived from the RT-
          2's MPLS Label1 field.

   Each RT-5 will be sent with a route-target identifying the tenant
   (IP-VRF) and the Router's MAC Extended Community containing the MAC
   address associated to core-facing IRB interface. This MAC address MAY
   be re-used for all the IP-VRFs in the NVE.

   The following example illustrates the procedure to advertise and
   forward packets to SN1/24 (ipv4 prefix advertised from NVE1) for
   VXLAN tunnels:

   (1) NVE1 advertises the following BGP routes:

        o Route type 5 (IP Prefix route) containing:

          . IPL=24, IP=SN1, VNI= SHOULD be set to 0.

          . GW IP= SHOULD be set to 0.

          . Router's MAC Extended Community containing M1 (this will be
            used for the recursive lookup to a RT-2).

          . Route-target identifying the tenant (IP-VRF).

        o Route type 2 (MAC route for the core-facing IRB) containing: 

          . ML=48, M=M1, IPL=0, VNI=10.

          . A [RFC5512] BGP Encapsulation Extended Community with
            Tunnel-type=VXLAN.

          . Route-target identifying the tenant. This route-target MAY
            be the same as the one used with the RT-5.

   (2) DGW1 imports the received routes from NVE1:

        o DGW1 installs SN1/24 in the IP-VRF identified by the RT-5
          route-target.

          . The MAC contained in the Router's MAC Extended Community
            sent along with the RT-5 (M1) will be used as the overlay
            index for the recursive route resolution to the RT-2
            carrying M1.

   (3) When DGW1 receives a packet from the WAN with destination IPx,
       where IPx belongs to SN1/24:

        o A destination IP lookup is performed on the DGW1 IP-VRF
          routing table. The lookup yields SN1/24, which is associated
          to the overlay index M1. The forwarding information is derived
          from the RT-2 received for M1.

        o The IP packet destined to IPx is encapsulated with: Source
          inner MAC = M3, Destination inner MAC = M1, Source outer IP
          (source VTEP) = DGW1 IP, Destination outer IP (destination
          VTEP) = NVE1 IP.

   (4) When the packet arrives at NVE1:

        o NVE1 will identify the IP-VRF for an IP-lookup based on the
          VNI and the inner MAC DA.

        o An IP lookup is performed in the routing context, where SN1
          turns out to be a local subnet associated to MAC-VRF2. A
          subsequent lookup in the ARP table and the MAC-VRF FIB will
          provide the forwarding information for the packet in MAC-VRF2.

   The implementation of the Interface-full with unnumbered core-facing
   IRB model is OPTIONAL.


6. Conclusions

   An EVPN route (type 5) for the advertisement of IP Prefixes is
   described in this document. This new route type has a differentiated
   role from the RT-2 route and addresses all the Data Center (or NVO-
   based networks in general) inter-subnet connectivity scenarios in
   which an IP Prefix advertisement is required. Using this new RT-5, an
   IP Prefix may be advertised along with an overlay index that can be a

   GW IP address, a MAC or an ESI, or without an overlay index, in which
   case the BGP next-hop will point at the egress NVE and the MAC in the
   Router's MAC Extended Community will provide the inner MAC
   destination address to be used. As discussed throughout the document,
   the EVPN RT-2 does not meet the requirements for all the DC use
   cases, therefore this EVPN route type 5 is required.

   The EVPN route type 5 decouples the IP Prefix advertisements from the
   MAC/IP route advertisements in EVPN, hence:

   a) Allows the clean and clear advertisements of ipv4 or ipv6 prefixes
      in an NLRI with no MAC addresses in the route key, so that only IP
      information is used in BGP route comparisons.

   b) Since the route type is different from the MAC/IP Advertisement
      route, the advertisement of prefixes will be excluded from all the
      procedures defined for the advertisement of VM MACs, e.g. MAC
      Mobility or aliasing. As a result of that, the current [RFC7432]
      procedures do not need to be modified.

   c) Allows a flexible implementation where the prefix can be linked to
      different types of overlay indexes: overlay IP address, overlay
      MAC addresses, overlay ESI, underlay IP next-hops, etc. 

   d) An EVPN implementation not requiring IP Prefixes can simply
      discard them by looking at the route type value. An unknown route
      type MUST be ignored by the receiving NVE/PE.
