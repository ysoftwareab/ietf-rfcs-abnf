Internet-Draft                 ALTO H1/H2                     March 2009


Abstract

   Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as
   pieces of information or server processes, which are available in
   several equivalent replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but
   is not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal
   of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
   guidance to applications, which have to select one or several hosts
   from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired
   resource.  This memo proposes one possible way of implementing the
   ALTO protocol, called H1H2.  The H1H2 protocol is a client/server
   protocols between end hosts and ALTO servers that allows two
   different ways of exchanging data between the server and the client.

1.  Introduction

   Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as
   pieces of information or server processes, which are available in
   several equivalent replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but
   is not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal
   of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
   guidance to applications, which have to select one or several hosts
   from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired
   resource.  This memo proposes one possible way of implementing the
   ALTO protocol, called H1H2.  The H1H2 protocol is a client/server
   protocols between end hosts and ALTO servers.

   The problem space of ALTO is described in
   [I-D.marocco-alto-problem-statement] and the set of requirements is
   discussed in [I-D.kiesel-alto-reqs].

   Comments and discussions about this protocol proposal should be
   directed to the ALTO working group: alto@ietf.org.

2.  Solution Space

   The ALTO protocol is a client/server protocol, operating between a
   number of ALTO clients and an ALTO server, as sketched in Figure 1

                Figure 1: Network Overview of ALTO Protocol

   An ALTO server stores information about preferences (e.g., a list of
   preferred autonomous systems, IP ranges, etc) and ALTO clients can
   retrieve these preferences.  However, there are basically two
   different approaches on where the preferences are actually processed:

   1.  The ALTO server has a list of preferences and clients can
       retrieve this list via the ALTO protocol.  This preference list
       can be partially updated by the server.  The actual processing of
       the data is done on the client and thus there is no data of the
       client's operation revealed to the ALTO server .  This approach
       has been proposed by [I-D.shalunov-alto-infoexport].

   2.  The ALTO server has a list of preferences or preferences
       calculated during runtime and the ALTO client is sending
       information of its operation (e.g., a list of IP addresses) to
       the server.  The server is using this operational information to
       determine its preferences and returns these preferences (e.g., a
       sorted list of the IP addresses) back to the ALTO client.  This
       approach has been initially described in [ACM.ispp2p], but never
       been described on the protocol level.

   Approach 1 (we call it H1) has the advantage (seen from the client)
   that all operational information stays within the client and is not

   revealed to the provider of the server.  On the other hand, does
   approach 1 require that the provider of the ALTO server, i.e., the
   network operator, reveals information about its network structure
   (e.g., AS numbers, IP ranges, topology information in general) to the
   ALTO client.

   Approach 2 (we call it H2) has the advantage (seen from the operator)
   that all operational information stays with the ALTO server and is
   not revealed to the ALTO client.  On the other hand, does approach 2
   require that the clients send their operational information to the
   server.

   Both approaches have their pros and cons and are extensively
   discussed on the ALTO mailing list.  But there is basically a
   dilemma: Approach 1 is seen as the only working solution by peer-to-
   peer software vendors and approach 2 is seen as the only working by
   the network operators.  But neither the software vendors nor the
   operators seem to willing to change their position.  However, there
   is the need to get both sides on board, to come to a solution.

   Therefore, does this memo proposes to integrate both approaches in
   one protocol and offer a way for clients and servers to learn each
   preferred way of operating.

3.  Proposed Solution

   The current proposed solution is not yet defining a bit level syntax
   but describes the protocol on a high-level, i.e. it is more
   incomplete than complete.

   The H1H2 protocol uses TCP as transport protocol between clients and
   server and some encoding of the messages to be defined later on.

   The basic mechanism of the H1H2 protocol is to introduce an offer/
   answer mechanism in the SETUP message of the protocol.  The SETUP
   message is the first message sent from client to the server after the
   TCP session setup.  The client includes is preference of data
   exchange, i.e., whether is willing to run H1, H2, or both.  The
   server can then reply with its decisions, either to accept the
   clients choice, or why choice or to reject the choice.

   Depending on the agreed mode, either H1 or H2, the protocol will
   proceed.  The exact mechanism are TBD in future revisions.

   However, this can lead to deadlock situations where clients ask only
   for H1 and the server insists on H2, i.e., there won't be an
   agreement between both ends.  Meaning that there is no gain for both
   sides - the above described dilemma is basically still unsolved.

4.  Security Considerations

   This initial version of this memo does not yet have any security
   considerations, but they will be added in future revision.

5.  Conclusion

   This memo presents a very basic straw man protocol, is for sure work
   in progress, and is requesting feedback from the ALTO working group.
   Ask the authors why it is called H1H2 and not different.
