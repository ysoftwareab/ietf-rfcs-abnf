1. 
  Abstract

   This memo documents a way to transport particular data for  active
   routers inside IPv6. It uses the Ipv6 extension headers to transport
   information on the data, coding the type of execution environment it
   is designated.


2. 
  Conventions and terminology used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].

   Terminology:

   o Active network

   A network of nodes where nodes are able to process the received data
   in a specific manner. That means that each active node must be able
   to run algorithms other than those known at build-time.

   o Active router
                 Active Router EE Information in Ipv6    November 2000




   An active router is able to execute some code they received or
   downloaded, taking the IP packets as input data.

   o Execution environment

   The environment where the processing of the received data is
   executed. It gives access of router resources to the executing code.

3. 
  Introduction

   Active network defines network composed of active nodes where data
   can be specifically processed. The active routers are able to
   receive code to be executed with the payload of the IP packets as
   input. Packets tagged for being processed are called "active
   packets". The processing takes place into the execution environment
   (EE) which can be specific to each routers family.

   Proposed formats for active packet are build upon IP. This implies
   that the router must decode the payload of the IP packet before to
   check if the packet is active, and if it is able to process the
   active packet.
   One of the key issue of the active network is the performance issue.
   Routers must be able to quickly process the active packets, in
   order, either to execute the corresponding code, or to consider it
   as any other packet. Putting active network information in the
   payload of an IP packet slows down this process.

   RFC2711 [3] describes the "Router Alert" header option which is used
   to notify the routers that the payload of the packet needs care. In
   this RFC, a value is defined for an active network payload. This
   needed information is not sufficient because of the diversity of
   active routers. What an active router needs to know quickly is if
   the received active packet is designated to one of the execution
   environment loaded (or which can be loaded) on the router.

   This documents describes the way to use IPv6 Hop-by-Hop extension
   header in order to transport active packet related information, and
   to allow router to decode these at low cost.

4. 
  Specification

   The IPv6 protocol [4] defines some extension headers  for Ipv6
   packets. One of these extensions, the Hop-by-Hop extension header,
   is specifically designed such that all routers on the path can
   quickly look at it. For decoding performance reasons, this Hop-by-
   Hop extension header is always the first extension.

   RFC2711 describes the "Router Alert" header option (value : 5) which
   is used to notify the routers that the payload of the packet needs
   care. It is possible to precise in this option that the data is
   related to active networks; but there is no way to give the
   execution environment needed to process this packet.
                 Active Router EE Information in Ipv6    November 2000




   To allow active routers to quickly know if they have to process a
   received active packet, i.e. not only if the packet is an active
   packet, but also if the router knows the corresponding execution
   environment, a new type for the Hop-by-Hop extension header is
   defined.

   In addition to this active packet presence information, code values
   for execution environment are put into the value part of the Hop-by-
   Hop extension header.

   The following shows the format of the Hop-by-Hop extension header.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |   AN Type     |   Length      |        EE ID                  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                     EE specific info                          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The fields are the following:

        o AN Type (8 bits) : reserved type of extension header for the
        Active Network. This value will be registered by IANA (see
        section "IANA Considerations")

        o Length (8 bits) : size (in 32 bits words) of the "EE specific
        info" field.

        o EE ID : the ID of the execution environment needed to process
        the active packet. This ID will be registered by the ANANA (see
        section "Other assignment authority considerations")

        o EE specific info : this field is in EE's specific format and
        it codes the specific requirements or info for this execution
        environment. For example, the active packet SHOULD indicates in
        this field the modules needed for correct processing of the
        data. This will allow the router to quickly, and in an
        efficient way, check if they have the needs for processing the
        packet. The behavior of an router which does not have all the
        needed library or modules is out of the scope of this document.
        If the used technology is based on code embedded in the packet,
        this code could be transported in this field.
        The format used, as well as the assignment of identifiers for
        this field are out of the scope of this document.

5. 
  IANA Considerations

   The  AN Type  described in Section 4 will be  registered and
   maintained by IANA when necessary, as defined in RFC 2434 [5].

6. 
  Other assignment authority considerations
                 Active Router EE Information in Ipv6    November 2000



   The ID of the Execution Environment should be registered by the
   Active Network Assignment Number Authority [6].

7. 
  Security considerations

   No new security issues are raised by this document.
