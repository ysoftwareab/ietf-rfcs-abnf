               Home Network Prefix Renumbering in PMIPv6
                     draft-yan-dmm-hnprenum-02.txt

Abstract

   In the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) specification, an Mobile Node
   (MN) is assigned with a 64-bit Home Network Prefix (HNP) during its
   initial attachment for the Home Address (HoA) configuration.  During
   the movement of the MN, this prefix remains unchanged and in this way
   it is unnecessary for the MN to reconfigure its HoA and reconnect the
   ongoing communications.  However, the current protocol [RFC5213]
   does not specify related operations to support the MN to timely
   receive and use a new HNP when the allocated HNP changes.  In this
   draft, a possible solution to support the HNP renumbering is
   proposed, as an update of RFC5213.

1.  Introduction

   Network managers currently prefer to Provider Independent (PI)
   addressing for IPv6 to attempt to minimize the need for future
   possible renumbering.  However, widespread use of PI addresses may
   cause very serious Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) scaling problems.
   It is thus desirable to develop tools and practices that may make
   IPv6 renumbering a simpler process to reduce demand for IPv6 PI space
   [RFC6879].  In this draft, we aim to solve the HNP renumbering
   problem when the HNP in PMIPv6 [RFC5213] is not the type of PI.

2.  Usage scenarios

   There are a number of reasons why the HNP renumbering support is
   useful and a few are identified below:

   o  Scenario 1: the PMIPv6 service provider is assigned with the HNP
      set from the (uplink) Internet Service Provider (ISP), and then
      the HNP renumbering may happen if the PMIPv6 service provider
      switches to a different ISP.

Internet-Draft           PMIPv6 HNP Renumbering                July 2015


   o  Scenario 2: multiple Local Mobility Anchors (LMAs) may be deployed
      by the same PMIPv6 service provider, and then each LMA may serve
      for a specific HNP set.  In this case, the HNP of an MN may change
      if the current serving LMA switches to another LMA but without
      inheriting the assigned HNP set [RFC6463].

   o  Scenario 3: the PMIPv6 HNP renumbering may be caused by the re-
      building of the network architecture as the companies split,
      merge, grow, relocate or reorganize.  For example, the PMIPv6
      service provider may reorganize its network topology.

   In the scenario 1, we assume that only the HNP is renumbered while
   the serving LMA remains unchanged and this is the basic scenario of
   this document.  In the scenario 2 and scenario 3, more complex
   results may be caused, for example, the HNP renumbering may happen
   due to the switchover of serving LMA.

   In the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6), when the home network prefix changes (may
   be also caused by the above reasons), the Home Agent (HA) will
   actively notify the new prefix to the MN and then the renumbering of
   the HoA can be well supported [RFC6275].  While in the basic PMIPv6,
   the PMIPv6 binding is triggered by the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG),
   which detected the attachment of the MN.  When the HNP renumbering
   happens, a scheme is also needed for the LMA to immediately initiate
   the PMIPv6 binding state refreshment.  Although this issue is also
   discussed in the [RFC5213] (Section 6.12), the related solution has
   not been specified.

3.  PMIPv6 extensions

   When the HNP renumbering happens in PMIPv6, the LMA has to notify the
   new HNP to the MAG and then the MAG has to announce the new HNP to
   the MN accordingly.  Also, the LMA and the MAG must delete the
   created routing states for the renumbered prefix.  To support this
   procedure, RFC7077 can be adopted which specifies asynchronously
   update from the LMA to the MAG about the updated session parameters.
   This document considers the following two cases:

   (1)HNP is renumbered in the same LMA

   In this case, the LMA remains unchanged as in the scenario 1 and
   scenario 3.  The operation steps are shown in Figure 1.

             Figure 1: Signaling call flow of HNP renumbering

   o  When the PMIPv6 service provider renumbers the HNP set in the same
      LMA, the serving LMA will initiate the HNP renumbering operation.
      The LMA allocates a new HNP for the related MN.

   o  The LMA sends the Update Notification (UPN) message to the MAG to
      update the HNP information.  If the DHCP is used in PMIPv6 to
      allocate the HoA, the new HNP should be also notified to the DHCP
      infrastructure.

   o  After the MAG receives this UPN message, it recognizes that the
      related MN has a new HNP.  Then the MAG should notify the MN about
      the new HNP with a RA message or allocate a new address within the
      new HNP with a DHCP message.

   o  When the MN obtains the new HNP information, it deletes the old
      HoA and configures a new HoA with the newly allocated HNP.

   o  The MAG sends back the Update Notification Acknowledgement (UNA)
      to the LMA for the notification of successful update of the HNP,
      related binding state, and routing state.  Then the LMA updates
      the routing information corresponding to the MN to replace the old
      HNP with the new one.

   (2) HNP renumbering caused by LMA switchover

   Because the HNP is assigned by the LMA, the HNP renumbering may be
   caused by the LMA switchover, as in the scenario 2 and scenario 3.

Internet-Draft           PMIPv6 HNP Renumbering                July 2015


   The information of LMA is the basic configuration information of MAG.
   When the LMA changes, the related profile should be updated by the
   service provider.  In this way, the MAG will initiate the re-
   registration to the new LMA as specified in RFC5213.  When the HNP
   renumbering is caused in this case, the new HNP information will be
   sent by the LMA during the new bingding procedure.  Accordingly, the
   MAG will withdraw the old HNP information of the MN and advise the
   new HNP to the MN as Step (3) in Section 3.1.

4.  Session connectivity

   HNP renumbering may cause the disconnection of the ongoing
   communications of the MN.  Basiclly, there are two modes to manage
   the session connectivity during the HNP renumbering.

   (1)Soft-mode

   The LMA will temporarily maintain the state of the old HNP during the
   HNP renumbering (after the UNA reception) in order to redirect the
   packets to the MN before the MN reconnets the ongoing session and
   notifies its new HoA to the Corresponding Node (CN).  This mode is
   aiming to reduce the packet loss during the HNP renumbering but the
   binding state and routing entry corresponding to the old HNP should
   be marked for example as transient binding [RFC6058].  This
   temporary binding should only be used for the downwards packet
   transmission and its lifetime should be set to lower than the normal
   lifetime of the PMIPv6 binding state.

   (2)Hard-mode

   If the HNP renumbering happens with the switchover of the LMA, the
   hard-mode is recommended to keep the protocol simple and efficient.
   The LMA will delete the state of the old HNP after it receives the
   UNA message from MAG.  In this mode, the LMA will silently discard
   the packets destinated to the old HNP.

5.  Message format

   (1)UPN message

   In the UPN message sent from the LMA to the MAG, the notification
   reason is set to 2 (UPDATE-SESSION-PARAMETERS).  Besides, the HNP
   option containing the new HNP and the Mobile Node Identifier option
   carrying Identifier of MN are contained as Mobility Options of UPN.

   (2)RA Message

Internet-Draft           PMIPv6 HNP Renumbering                July 2015


   When the RA message is used by the MAG to advise the new HNP, two
   Prefix Information options are contained in the RA message [RFC2461].
   In the first Prefix Information option, the old HNP is carried but
   both the related Valid Lifetime and Preferred Lifetime are set to 0.
   In the second Prefix Information option, the new HNP is carried with
   the Valid Lifetime and Preferred Lifetime set to larger than 0.

   (3)DHCP Message

   When the DHCP is used in PMIPv6 to configure the HoA for the MN, a
   new IPv6 HoA is generated based on the new HNP.  Trigged by the UPN
   message, the MAG will request the new HoA from the DHCP server first
   and then the MAG updates the allocated HoA to the MN through the DHCP
   server-initiated configuration exchange [RFC3315].

6.  Other issues

   In order to maintain the reachability of the MN, the DNS resource
   record corresponding to this MN may need to be updated when the HNP
   of MN changes [RFC3007].  However, this is out the scope of this
   draft.

7.  Security considerations

   This extension causes no further security problem.  The security
   considerations in [RFC5213] and [RFC7077] are enough for the basic
   operation of this draft.

   Other security issues will be analyzed further.
