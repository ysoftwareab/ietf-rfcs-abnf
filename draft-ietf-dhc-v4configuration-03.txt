        Provisioning IPv4 Configuration Over IPv6 Only Networks
                   draft-ietf-dhc-v4configuration-03

Abstract

   As IPv6 becomes more widely adopted, some service providers are
   choosing to deploy IPv6 only networks without dual-stack
   functionality for IPv4.  However, as access to IPv4 based services
   will continue to be a requirement for the foreseeable future, IPv4
   over IPv6 mechanisms, such as softwire tunnels are being developed.

   In order to provision end-user's hosts with the IPv4 configuration
   necessary for such mechanisms, a number of different approaches have
   been proposed.  This memo discusses each of the proposals, identifies
   the benefits and drawbacks and recommends a single approach as the
   basis for future deployment and development.

1.  Introduction

   A service provider with an IPv6-only network must also be able to
   provide customers with access to the IPv4 Internet and other
   IPv4-only services.  IPv4 over IPv6 tunneling / translation
   mechanisms are an obvious example of this, such as the ones described
   in:

   o  [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6]

   o  [I-D.ietf-softwire-map]

   o  [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-t]

   In todays home networks, each residential user is allocated a single
   global IPv4 address which is used for NAT44.  Decentralizing NAT44
   allows for much better scaling and, when combined with stateless
   network functions, can simplify redundancy and logging.  This results
   in the need to provision a number of configuration parameters to the
   CPE, such as the external public IPv4 address and a restricted port-
   range to use for NAT.  Other parameters may also be necessary,
   depending on the underlying transport technology that is in use.  In
   IPv4 only networks, DHCPv4 has often been used to provide IPv4
   configuration, but in an IPv6 only network, DHCPv4 messages cannot be
   transported natively.

   For the most simple IPv4 provisioning case, where the client only
   needs to receive a static IPv4 address assignment (with no dynamic
   address leasing or additional IPv4 configuration), DHCPv6 based
   approaches (e.g. [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp]) may provide a suitable
   solution.

   This document is concerned with more complex IPv4 configuration
   scenarios, to bring IPv4 configuration over IPv6-only networks in
   line with the functionality offered by DHCPv4 in IPv4 native
   networks.  DHCPv4 options may also need to be conveyed to clients for
   configuring IPv4 based services, e.g. SIP server addresses.

   Although IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire tunnel and translation clients are
   currently the only use-case for DHCP based configuration of IPv4

   parameters in IPv6 only networks, a suitable approach must not be
   limited to only supporting softwires configuration or be reliant on
   specific underlying IPv4 over IPv6 architectures or mechanisms.

   This document describes and compares five different methods which
   have been proposed as solutions to this problem.

1.1.  Overview of IPv4 Parameter Configuration Approaches

   The following approaches for transporting IPv4 configuration
   parameters over IPv6 only networks have been suggested:

   1.  Adapt DHCPv4 format messages to be transported over IPv6 as
       described in [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6].  For brevity, this
       is referred to as DHCPv4o6.

   2.  Extend DHCPv6 to support IPv4 address leasing and other DHCPv4
       options.

   3.  Use DHCPv6 as above for external IPv4 address and source port
       configuration.  Use DHCPv4 over IPv4 messages within an IPv6
       softwire for configuring additional parameters.  This is referred
       to as DHCPv6 + Stateless DHCPv4oSW.

   4.  Use DHCPv4 over IPv4 messages transported over a broadcast
       capable IPv4overIPv6 transport (e.g. a softwire) for all IPv4
       configuration including the external IPv4 address and source port
       configuration.  This is referred to as DHCPv4oSW.

   5.  Use DHCPv4 format messages, transporting them within a new DHCPv6
       message type as described in [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6].
       This is referred to as DHCPv4oDHCPv6.

   At the time of writing, working examples of the first two methods
   have been developed and successfully tested in several different
   operators networks.  The fourth approach has been tested successfully
   in a lab environment.  The remaining two methods are still
   theoretical.

   The following sections provide describe each of the approaches in
   more detail.

1.2.  DHCPv4o6 Based Provisioning - Functional Overview

   In order to receive IPv4 configuration parameters, IPv4-only clients
   initiate and exchange DHCPv4 messages with the DHCPv4 server.  To
   adapt this for an IPv6-only network, an existing DHCPv4 client
   implements a 'Host Client Relay' (HCRA) function, which takes DHCPv4
   messages and puts them into UDPv6 and IPv6.

   As the mechanism involves unicast based communications, the IPv6
   address of the server must be provisioned to the client.  This option
   is described in [I-D.mrugalski-softwire-dhcpv4-over-v6-option].

   The IPv6 Transport Server (TSV) provides an IPv6 interface to the
   client.  This interface may be directly on the server and/or via an
   intermediary 'Transport Relay Agent' (TRA) device acting as the
   gateway between the IPv4 and IPv6 domains.

   For the dynamic allocation of IPv4 addresses, the DHCPv4 server
   function needs to be extended to add DHCPv4o6 TSV capabilities, such
   as the storing the IPv6 address of DHCPv4o6 clients and implementing
   the CRA6ADDR option.

   This approach currently uses functional elements for ingress and
   egress of the IPv6-only transport domain - the HCRA on the host and
   the TRA or TSV on the server.  As a result, this approach has
   sometimes been referred to as a tunneling approach.  However, relay
   agent encapsulation is not a tunnel, since it carries only DHCP
   traffic; it would be more accurate to describe it as an encapsulation
   based transport.

   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6] also defines an On-Link Client Relay
   agent (LCRA), which is a Client Relay Agent located on the same link
   as an unmodified DHCPv4 client.  It is worth noting that there is no
   technical reason for using relay encapsulation for DHCPv4o6; this
   approach was taken because the authors of the draft originally
   imagined that it might be used to provide configuration information
   for an unmodified DHCPv4 client.  However, this turns out not to be a
   viable approach: in order for this to work, there would have to be
   IPv4 routing on the local link to which the client is connected.  In
   that case, there's no need for DHCPv4o6.

   Given that this is the case, there is no technical reason why
   DHCPv4o6 can't simply use the IPv6 transport directly, without any
   relay encapsulation.  This would greatly simplify the specification
   and the implementation, and would still address the requirements
   stated in this document.

   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6] describes this solution in detail.

   The protocol stack is as follows:

   DHCPv4/UDPv6/IPv6

1.3.  DHCPv6 Based Provisioning - Functional Overview

   In this approach, DHCPv6 [RFC3315] would be extended with new DHCPv6
   options for configuring all IPv4 based services and functions (i.e.
   IPv4 address assignment and any necessary DHCPv4 options).  DHCPv4
   options needed by IPv4 clients connected to the IPv6 network are
   updated as new DHCPv6 native options carrying IPv4 configuration
   parameters.  IPv4 address leasing would also need to be managed by
   the DHCPv6 server.

   At the time of writing, it is not known which or how many such
   options would need to be ported from DHCPv4 to DHCPv6.

   The protocol stack is as follows:

   DHCPv6/UDPv6/IPv6

1.4.  DHCPv6 + Stateless DHCPv4oSW Based Provisioning - Functional
      Overview

   In this approach, the configuration of IPv4 address and source ports
   (if required) is carried out using DHCPv6, e.g. using
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp].  Any additional IPv4 configuration
   parameters which are required are then provisioned using DHCPv4
   messages transported within IPv6 in the configured softwire in the
   same manner as any other IPv4 based traffic.  Broadcast based DHCPv4
   DHCPDISCOVER messages (necessary for IPv4 address assignment) can not
   be transported as they are not compatible with the softwire
   architecture.

   On receipt by the tunnel concentrator (e.g. MAP Border Router or a
   Lightweight 4over6 lwAFTR), the DHCPv4 message is removed from the
   softwire and forwarded to the DHCPv4 server in the same way as any
   other IPv4 packet is handled.

   As the client is already configured with its external IPv4 address
   and source ports (using DHCPv6 or a well-known IPv4 address for DS-
   Lite clients), the messages exchanged between the DHCPv4 client and
   server would be strictly DHCPINFORM/DHCPACK messages.  These would be
   used for the configuration of any additional IPv4 parameters.

   For this approach to function, a mechanism for the DHCPv4 client to
   learn the IPv4 address of the DHCPv4 server is also required.  This
   could be via a well-known IPv4 address for the DHCPv4 server, a

   DHCPv4 relay function within the tunnel concentrator or other
   methods.

   From a transport perspective, the key difference between this method
   and DHCPv4o6 (described above) is the protocol stack.  Here the
   DHCPv4 message is first put into UDPv4 and IPv4 and then into the
   IPv6 softwire, instead of placing the DHCPv4 message directly into
   UDPv6 and IPv6.

   Currently, this approach is only theoretical and does not have a
   corresponding Internet Draft providing more detail.

   The protocol stack used for obtaining an IPv4 address and source
   ports (if required) is as follows:

   DHCPv6/UDPv6/IPv6

   The protocol stack used for obtaining additional IPv4 configuration
   is as follows:

   DHCPv4/UDPv4/IPv4/IPv6

1.5.  DHCPv4oSW Based Provisioning - Functional Overview

   [I-D.troan-dhc-dhcpv4osw] describes a method for complete client
   configuration using DHCPv4 transported across a broadcast capable
   link layer transport, such as a softwire.  It differs from stateless
   DHCPv6+DHCPv4oSW in that it is capable of supporting all DHCPv4
   message types and is not limited solely to DHCPINFORM/DHCPACK
   messages.  This means that it is also suitable the assignment of IPv4
   addresses as well as other DHCPv4 options.

   Functionally, a DHCPv4 client operates on the link layer interface
   (e.g. the softwire tunnel interface).  As the link layer must support
   broadcasts, DHCPDISCOVER and other broadcast DHCPv4 messages can be
   transported.  The DHCPv4 message flow is then the same as described
   in section 3.1 of [RFC2131].

   In this approach, either the tunnel concentrator must also be the
   DHCPv4 server or it must act as a DHCPv4 relay.  This allows
   broadcast DHCPDISCOVER/DHCPREQUEST messages to be decapsulated and
   forwarded to the DHCPv4 server.  If the concentrator is functioning
   as a relay, then the DHCPv4 Relay Information Option (option 82) is
   used to convey the client's source IPv6 address.  This is also used
   by the relay for routing return DHCPv4 packets.

   A DHCPv4oSW client may be configured with a shared IPv4 address with
   restricted layer 4 source ports.  This will normally exclude the

   well-known TCP/UDP ports in the range 0-1023, so the UDPv4 DHCP
   client port (68) would not be available.  This problem could be
   resolved using one of the following two methods:

   o  The DHCPv4oSW client is updated to source BOOTP/DHCP requests
      using a port taken from the client's allocated range.  Likewise,
      the DHCPv4oSW server must use the L4 source port from a client's
      message as the destination port for the response.

   o  The DHCP Server Identifier Override Suboption described in
      [RFC5107] could be used to direct all DHCPv4 messages through the
      DHCPv4 relay.  As option 82 is being used to identify the
      destination IPv6 address for messages from the DHCPv4 server to
      the client, the L4 destination port is not necessary for the
      lookup process and could be left unchanged.

   The protocol stack used for obtaining DHCPv4 based configuration is:

   DHCPv4/UDPv4/IPv4/IPv6

1.6.  DHCPv4oDHCPv6 Based Provisioning - Functional Overview

   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] describes transporting DHCPv4
   messages within two new DHCPv6 messages types: BOOTREQUESTV6 and
   BOOTREPLYV6.  These new messages types must be implemented in both
   the DHCPv4oDHCPv6 client and server.

   In this approach, the configuration of stateless IPv4 addresses and
   source ports (if required) is carried out using DHCPv6 as described
   in section 1.3 above.  Dynamic IPv4 addressing, and/or any additional
   IPv4 configuration, is provided using DHCPv4 messages carried
   (without IPv4/UDPv4 headers) within a new OPTION_BOOTP_MSG DHCPv6
   option.

   OPTION_BOOTP_MSG enables the client and server to send BOOTP/DHCPv4
   messages verbatim across the IPv6 network.  When a DHCPv4oDHCPv6
   server receives a DHCPv6 request containing OPTION_BOOT_MSG within a
   BOOTREQUESTV6 message, it passes it to the DHCPv4 server engine.
   Likewise, the DHCPv4 server place its DHCPv4 response in the payload
   of OPTION_BOOTP_MSG and puts this into a BOOTPRPLYV6 message.

   DHCPv4 messages can be carried within DHCPv6 multicast messages,
   using the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address.  These
   can be relayed in exactly the same way as any other DHCPv6
   multicasted messages.

Internet-Draft     Provisioning IPv4 Config Over IPv6      December 2013


   Optionally, DHCPv6 relays could be updated so that they forward the
   BOOTREQUESTV6 message to a different destination address, allowing
   for the separation of DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 provisioning infrastructure.

   If the DHCPv4oDHCPv6 client is provision with a unicast IPv6
   address(es) for the server(s), then an entirely unicast message flow
   between the client and server is also possible without the need for
   relaying.

   The protocol stack used for obtaining dynamic v4 addressing or
   additional IPv4 configuration is as follows:

   DHCPv4/DHCPv6/UDPv6/IPv6

2.  Requirements for the Solution Evaluation

   The following requirements have been defined to evaluate the
   different approaches:

   1.  Minimize the amount of work necessary to implement the solution
       through re-use of existing standards and implementations as much
       as possible.

   2.  Provide a method of supporting all DHCPv4 options so that they
       can be utilized without the need for further standardization.

   3.  Allow for the dynamic leasing of IPv4 addresses to clients.  This
       allows for more efficient use of limited IPv4 resources.

   4.  Enable the separation of IPv4 and IPv6 host configuration
       infrastructure, i.e. independent DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 server
       functions to restrict provisioning domains to the relevant
       protocol and allow the removal of IPv4 infrastructure in the
       future.

   5.  Avoid leaving legacy IPv4 options in DHCPv6.

   6.  Provide a flexible architecture to give operators the option of
       only deploying the functional elements necessary for their
       specific requirements.

   7.  Not restricted to specific IPv4 over IPv6 transport mechanisms or
       architectures.

3.1.  DHCPv4o6 Based Provisioning

3.1.1.  Pros

   1.  Implementation makes all existing DHCPv4 options available with
       no further ongoing development work necessary.

   2.  IPv4 and IPv6 based provisioning can be separated from each other
       if required, allowing flexibility in network design.

   3.  Easy to implement through minor adaptation of existing DHCPv4
       client, relay and server code.

   4.  No additional functional elements are necessary except the
       DHCPv4o6 client relay agent and server.  If a TSV is used, then a
       TRA is not required.

   5.  Suitable for dynamic IPv4 address leases where the IPv4 address
       lifetime is not linked to the lifetime of a DHCPv6 lease.

   6.  Implementations already exist, proving that the approach works.

3.1.2.  Cons

Internet-Draft     Provisioning IPv4 Config Over IPv6      December 2013


   1.  More new functional elements required within the architecture
       (CRA, DHCPv4o6 server and optionally TRA) than are necessary in
       DHCPv6 based provisioning.

   2.  A new DHCPv6 option is necessary in order to provision the IPv6
       address of the DHCPv4 server to the end device.

   3.  The DHCPv4 client host needs to be updated to implement the IPv6
       encapsulation and decapsulation function (i.e. An HCRA).
       Otherwise a separate On-Link CRA (LCRA) functional element must
       be deployed.

   4.  A DHCPv4 server must be deployed and maintained.

   5.  The DHCPv4 server needs to be updated to implement new DHCPv4o6
       functionality.

3.2.  DHCPv6 Based Provisioning

3.2.1.  Pros

   1.  No additional functional elements are required except the DHCPv6
       client and server.

   2.  A single protocol is used to deliver configuration information
       for IPv4 and IPv6.

   3.  Single provisioning point for all configuration parameters.

   4.  Implementations already exist, proving that the approach works.

3.2.2.  Cons

   1.  Any required DHCPv4 options must be ported to DHCPv6, which will
       require re-development work for each option.

   2.  Means that DHCPv4 'legacy' options (which will be of decreasing
       relevance in the future) will remain in DHCPv6 for the lifetime
       of the protocol.

   3.  Each time that a DHCPv4 option is ported to DHCPv6, all clients
       and servers and possibly relays would need to be updated to
       implement the new option.

   4.  Architecture does not allow for the separation of IPv4 and IPv6
       domains.

   5.  Does not provide a mechanism for dynamic IPv4 address leasing,
       where the lifetime of IPv4 addresses is not linked to the
       lifetime of a DHCPv6 lease.  A DHCPv4 lease lifetime management
       mechanism would need to be added to DHCPv6 to implement this.

3.3.  DHCPv6 + Stateless DHCPv4oSW Based Provisioning

3.3.1.  Pros

   1.  Once implemented, all existing DHCPv4 options will be available
       with no ongoing development work necessary.

   2.  Uses existing DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 architectures in order to provide
       IPv4 configuration in an IPv6 only environment.

   3.  DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 based provisioning can be separated from each
       other if required, allowing flexibility in network design.

3.3.2.  Cons

   1.  More new functional elements required than are necessary in
       DHCPv6 based provisioning.

   2.  IPv4 over IPv6 softwire approaches that distribute NAT to the CPE
       and allow for IP address sharing (MAP-E & LW4o6) forbid the use
       of reserved TCP/UDP ports (e.g. 0-1024).  Every DHCPv4 client
       sharing the same address needs to have a UDP listener running on
       UDP port 68.  To resolve this would require significant rework to
       either the softwire mechanisms and/or the DHCPv4 client
       implementation.

   3.  From the current specification, DHCPINFORM is not suitable for
       use over a softwire.  Additional work, such as the development of
       'shims' would be necessary.

   4.  The current DHCPINFORM specification has a number of unclear
       points, such as those described in
       [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpinform-clarify].  Substantial work would be
       required to resolve this.

   5.  Links the deployment of IPv4 configuration over IPv6 to a
       softwire implementation (e.g. requiring a softwire concentrator
       to act as a DHCPv4 relay).  Whilst softwires are the only
       application for this functionality at the moment, this may not be
       the case in the future, meaning another solution may be required.

Internet-Draft     Provisioning IPv4 Config Over IPv6      December 2013


   6.  A new mechanism must be defined in order to provide the DHCPv4
       client with the IPv4 address of the DHCPv4 server so that unicast
       DHCPINFORM messages can be sent.

   7.  As only the DHCPINFORM/DHCPACK DHCPv4 message types are
       supported, dynamic IPv4 address leasing (using DHCPDISCOVER
       messages) can not be used.

   8.  Restricted to underlying hub-and-spoke IPv4 over IPv6
       architectures.  The 'hub' is necessary for the location of the
       DHCPv4 relay, as all traffic must pass through it.  An underlying
       mesh architecture does not have such a location to deploy the
       relay function.

   9.  The approach is unproven as no existing implementations exist.

3.4.  DHCPv4oSW Based Provisioning

3.4.1.  Pros

   1.  Once implemented, all existing DHCPv4 options will be available
       with no ongoing development work necessary.

   2.  Uses existing DHCPv4 architecture in order to provide IPv4
       configuration in an IPv6 only environment.

   3.  DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 based provisioning can be separated from each
       other if required, allowing flexibility in network design.

3.4.2.  Cons

   1.  Requires the DHCPv4 client, DHCPv4 server and softwire
       concentrator (or other relaying device) to be modified.

   2.  May require the DHCPv4 client and server to be updated to use
       dynamic ports taken from the restricted port set allocated to the
       client instead of the well-known DHCPv4 ports.

   3.  The DHCPv4 client must be modified to identify the properties of
       the interface it is configuring and request parameters
       accordingly (e.g. restricted port-sets cannot be used on Ethernet
       transport interfaces but are allowed for a softwire transport)

   4.  Restricted to underlying hub-and-spoke IPv4 over IPv6
       architectures.  The 'hub' is necessary for the location of the
       DHCPv4 relay, as all traffic, including DHCPDISCOVER messages
       will pass through it.  An underlying mesh architecture does not
       have such a location to deploy the relay.

3.5.  DHCPv4oDHCPv6 Based Provisioning

3.5.1.  Pros

   1.  Once implemented, all existing DHCPv4 options will be available
       with no ongoing development work necessary.

   2.  Uses existing DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 architectures in order to provide
       IPv4 configuration in an IPv6 only environment.

   3.  DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 based provisioning can be separated from each
       other if required, allowing flexibility in network design.

   4.  Suitable for the provisioning of dynamic IPv4 configuration as
       the existing DHCPv4 leasing mechanism can be used.

3.5.2.  Cons

   1.  More new functional elements within the architecture than are
       necessary in DHCPv6 based provisioning.

   2.  DHCPv6 clients needs to be updated to implement the new DHCPv6
       message types (BOOTPREQUESTv6 and BOOTPREPLYv6).

   3.  The DHCPv6 server needs to be updated to implement new
       DHCPv4oDHCPv6 message types and functionality.

   4.  The approach is currently unproven as no existing implementations
       exist.

4.  Conclusion

   Whilst all of the approaches described here will require some
   development work to realize, it is clear from the above analysis that
   the most sustainable approach capitalizes on existing DHCPv4
   implementations and include them as new DHCPv6 message types.  The
   main rationale for this is that it enables all of DHCPv4's existing
   options to be migrated for use over IPv6 in a single step.

   Porting of all necessary DHCPv4 options to DHCPv6 would require
   ongoing development work, re-implementing existing DHCPv4
   functionality in DHCPv6.  This will result in having legacy DHCPv4
   options in DHCPv6, which will no longer be useful once IPv4 is
   completely abandoned.

   Therefore, the DHCPv6 approach is not suitable for delivering IPv4
   configuration parameters in an efficient, ongoing manner.

   The dynamic leasing of IPv4 addresses is fundamental to the efficient
   use of remaining IPv4 resources.  This will become increasingly
   important in the future, so a mechanism which supports this is
   necessary.  DHCPv6 + Stateless DHCPv4oSW does not provide this
   function and so is not recommended.

   The DHCPv4o6 approach requires a DHCPv4 server (with DHCPv4o6
   functionality) for all deployment scenarios, even when DHCPv4
   specific functionality (e.g. sending DHCPv4 options) is not required
   by the operator.

   DHCPv4o6 requires that there is a tunnel concentrator, or similar
   'hub' in the underlying architecture so that a DHCP relay can be
   deployed.  This does not meet Requirement 7.

   Therefore, this memo recommends DHCPv4oDHCPv6
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] as the best underlying approach for
   provisioning IPv4 parameters over an IPv6 only network.
