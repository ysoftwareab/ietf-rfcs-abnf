Abstract

This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information
Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
community.  In particular, it defines the objects for managing the
operations of the Fabric Element portion of the Fibre Channel Standard
defined in [1], [2] and [3].

This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant to
the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1
definitions.

There is a companion memo [10], that defines the objects for managing
the operations of the Node portion of the Fibre Channel Standard (FC).

INTERNET DRAFT            FC Fabric Element MIB         February 7, 1997


1. Overview

A Fibre Channel Fabric is an entity which interconnects Node Ports
(N_Ports).  It provides transport and routing functions.  In essence, a
Fabric is a network of N_Ports that may communicate with one another.  A
Fabric is composed of one or more Fabric Element that are interconnected
via Inter-element Links (IEL).  A Fabric Element is the smallest unit of
a Fabric that meets the definition of a Fabric.  It must consist of at
least three external ports to connect to either N_Ports or other Fabric
Elements.  In general, a Fabric Element port may be of one of the
following types:


(1)  F_Port, a fabric port to connect to an N_Port;

(2)  E_Port, an expansion port to connect to another Fabric Element;

(3)  M_Port, a node port that resides within the Fabric; or

(4)  FL_Port, a fabric port that also supports a FC Arbitrated Loop
     [12]).


This memo shall define objects related to a Fabric Element and its
F_Ports.  Objects related to other types of FC ports shall be defined in
future.

1.1. Management View of a Fabric Element

From the management perspective, it is helpful to view a Fabric Element
to be consisting of multiple "modules".  Each module is a grouping,
either physical or logical, of one or more ports that may be managed as
a sub-entity within the Fabric Element.

This module mapping is recommended but optional.  A vendor may elect to
put all ports into a single module, or to divide the ports into modules
that do not match physical divisions.

The object fcFeModuleCapacity, which has a maximum value of 256, indi-
cates the maximum number of modules that a given Fabric Element may con-
tain.  This value must remain constant from one management restart to
the next.

Each module is uniquely identified by a module number in the range of 1
through fcFeModuleCapacity inclusive.  Modules may come and go without
causing a management reset (of sysUpTime), and may be sparsely numbered

within the Fabric Element.  That is, the module numbering is not
required to be contiguous.  For instance, if a module is mapped physi-
cally to a field-replaceable card and in a 13-card cage Fabric Element,
cards 3, 5, 6 and 7 may be installed.  The vendor may choose to label
them as modules 3, 5, 6 and 7 respectively.  In this example, the value
of fcFeModuleCapacity is 13.

The object fcFeModuleFPortCapacity, which also has a maximum value of
256, indicates the maximum number of ports that a given module may con-
tain.  The value of fcFeModulePortCapacity must not change for a given
module.  However, a module may be deleted from the Fabric Element and
replaced with a module containing a different number of ports.  The
value of fcFeModuleLastOperStatusChange will indicate that a change took
place.

Each port within the Fabric Element is uniquely identified by a combina-
tion of module number and port number, where port number is an integer
in the range 1..fcFeModuleFPortCapacity.  As with modules within a Fab-
ric Element, ports within a module may be sparsely numbered.  That is
the port numbering is not required to be contiguous.  Likewise, ports
may come and go within a module without causing a management reset.

1.2. Structure of the Fabric Element MIB

This memo assumes that a Fabric Element has an SNMP entity (manager,
agent, or proxy agent) associated with its managed objects.  The managed
objects are divided as follow:

        - the Configuration group
        - the Operation group
        - the Error group
        - the Accounting group
        - the Capability group

In each group, scalar objects and table entries are defined.

The Configuration group contains configuration and service parameters
for the Fabric Element, modules and the F_Ports.

The Operation group contains the operational status and parameters of an
F_Port.  The group also contains the service parameters that have been
established between the F_Port and its attached N_Port, if applicable.

The Error group contains counters tracking various types of errors
detected by each F_Port.  The information may be used for diagnostics
and/or to derive the quality of the link between an F_Port and its

attached N_Port.

The Accounting group contains statistic data suitable for deriving
accounting and performance information.

The Capability group contains parameters indicating the inherent capa-
bility of the Fabric Element and each F_Port.


2. Application of MIB-II to Fabric Element


2.1. The System Group

For the purposes of the sysServices object in the System Group of MIB-II
[9], Fibre Channel is a data link layer protocol.  Thus, for a Fabric
Element, sysServices will have the integer value "2".

2.2. The Interface Group

The Interface Group of MIB-II defines generic managed objects for manag-
ing interfaces.  Although each F_Port of a Fabric Element is an inter-
face, either the mapping of some interface objects are inappropriate or
the definition of some interface objects are insufficient for Fibre
Channel.  Therefore the Interface Group of MIB-II will not be mapped in
this memo.

Note that a refinement of the Interface Group is being proposed [11].
When the status of [11] changes to "recommended" in future, the mapping
of the Interface Group may then be investigated.

2.3. The SNMP Group

The SNMP Group of MIB-II is mandatory for a Fabric Element that supports
an SNMP management entity.
