Abstract

This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information
Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
community.  In particular, it describes objects managing SNMP agents
that use the Agent Extensibility (AgentX) Protocol.

This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant to
the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1
definitions.

This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.

1.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of three major
components.  They are:

-  the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1] - the mechanisms used for
   describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

-  the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] - the core set of managed objects
   for the Internet suite of protocols.

-  the protocol, RFC 1157 [3] and/or RFC 1905 [4], - the protocol for
   accessing managed objects.

The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
experimentation and evaluation.

1.1.  Object Definitions

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the
SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
an administratively assigned name.  The object type together with an
object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of
the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string,
termed the descriptor, to also refer to the object type.

2.  Introduction

The SNMP Agent Extensibility Protocol (AgentX) is a protocol used to
distribute the implementation of an SNMP agent amongst a single "master
agent" and multiple "subagents". See [5] for details about the AgentX
protocol.

The goals of the AgentX MIB are:

-  List the set of subagents that currently have logical sessions open
   with the master agent.

-  Identify each subagent's type, vendor, transport address, AgentX
   protocol version, and other characteristics.

-  Identify the set of MIB objects each subagent implements, the context
   in which the objects are registered, and the priority of the
   registration.

Internet Draft                 AgentX MIB                  14 April 1998


-  Provide statistics about the protocol operation such as the number of
   packets to and from each subagent.

-  Determine protocol operational parameters such as the timeout
   interval for responses from a subagent and the priority at which a
   subagent registers a particular MIB region.

-  Allow (but do not require) managers to be able to modify AgentX
   protocol operational parameters and to explicitly close subagent
   sessions with the master agent.

3.  Overview

This MIB is organized into four groups.  The agentxGeneral group
provides information describing the master agent's Agentx support,
including the protocol version supported and the supported transport
mechanisms.  The agentxConnection group provides information describing
the current set of connections capable of carrying Agentx sessions.  The
agentxSession group provides information describing the current set of
AgentX sessions.  The agentxRegistration group provides information
describing the current set of registrations.

Three tables form the heart of this mib.  These are the connection,
session, and registration tables.

Entries in the registration table exist in a many-to-one relationship
with entries in the session table.  This relationship is represented
through the agentxSessionIndex and agentxConnIndex. Registration entries
are indexed by agentxConnIndex and agentxSessionIndex, to determine
which registration(s), a subagent session is responsible for a given
connection.

Entries in the session table exist in a many-to-one relationship with
entries in the connection table.  This relationship is represented
through the agentxConnIndex in a session table. Session entries are
indexed by agentxConnIndex to determine which sessions(s), are carried
by a given connection.

7.  Security Considerations
   In most cases, MIBs are not themselves security risks; if SNMP
   security is operating as intended, the use of a MIB to view
   information about a system, or to change some parameter at the
   system, is a tool, not a threat.

None of the read-only objects in this MIB reports a password, user data,
or anything else that is particularly sensitive.  If access to these
objects is not limited by an appropriate access control policy, these
objects can provide an attacker with information about a system's
configuration and the services that that system is providing.  Some
enterprises view their network and system configurations themselves, as

well as information about usage and performance, as corporate assets;
such enterprises may wish to restrict SNMP access to most of the objects
in the MIB.

This MIB contains two read-write objects: agentxDefaultTimeout and
agentxSessionAdminStatus.  Setting agentxDefaultTimeout to an
inappropriately small value can prevent new subagent sessions from being
usable.  Setting agentxSessionAdminStatus to an inappropriate value can
effectively prevent access to management information, or provide access
to inappropriate information.  Since changes to either of these objects
can adversely impact the manageability of a system, write access to
these objects should be subject to an appropriate access control policy.
Such a policy may be realized in an implementation by limiting support
for these objects to read-only access.
