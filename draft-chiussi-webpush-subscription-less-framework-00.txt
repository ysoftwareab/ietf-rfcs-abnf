INTERNET DRAFT    Subscription-Less Web Push Framework      July 6, 2015


1. Introduction

   The notion of subscription is one of the pillars of current Web Push
   service [I-D. draft-thomson-webpush-protocol][W3CAPI]. The need for
   explicit subscription from the User Agent (UA) stems from good
   reasons [RFC6973]. By its very nature, Web Push is an invasive
   service, which requires some form of explicit acceptance by the UA
   and some form of regulation by the Push Service to make sure that the
   push capabilities of different applications do not proliferate in
   such a way the volume and invasiveness of push traffic becomes
   uncontrollable.

   The need for explicit subscription, however, has its drawbacks.

   First, the mechanism is not scalable to a large number of
   subscriptions to different applications. This is intentional in the
   design, but also prevents the applicability of Web Push to some
   practical scenarios. This also makes it difficult to control the
   total volume Web Push traffic across applications directed to the
   same UA, without introducing excessive constraints. Some provisions
   to ameliorate this problem are included in [I-D. draft-thomson-
   webpush-protocol], but mechanisms for a global vision of Web Push
   traffic from a UA perspective are lacking.  

   Second, and more importantly, the need for subscription makes it
   awkward to apply Web Push to a number of relevant use cases. At least
   three such use cases are becoming increasingly popular and would
   benefit of a more relaxed definition of the Web Push service.

   1. Emergency and Alert Services. These may include highly local
      services that can provide very useful and timely information to
      the users, but may fail to reach the users because of no
      subscription. Some of these services are addressed in [I-D. draft-
      nakajima-webpush-problem-statement], but a much wider variety of
      these services is emerging.

   2. Usage of Web Push to wake up the mobile device. This functionality
      is increasingly required in location based services, especially
      indoor, and especially delivered through multiple air interfaces
      such as WiFi, Small Cells, Bluetooth, etc.

   3. Usage of Web Push in Smart Building and other environments where
      the user has a manifested expectation of tapping into available
      services in an unsolicited fashion.

   These use cases, which are rapidly growing in popularity are an
   indication that some notion of "subscription-less Web Push," or more
   precisely Web Push with some form of relaxed subscription

   requirements, is actually desirable and useful to increase the
   applicability of Web Push.

   This document introduces a framework for such a notion of
   "subscription-less" Web Push.

1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology defined in [I-D. draft-thomson-
   webpush-protocol].

2. Subscription-Less Web Push

   TBD.

3. Security Considerations

   TBD.

4. IANA Considerations

   TBD.
