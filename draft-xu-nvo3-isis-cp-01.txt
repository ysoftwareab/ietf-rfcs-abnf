                NVo3 Control Plane Protocol Using IS-IS
                        draft-xu-nvo3-isis-cp-01

Abstract

   This document describes the use of IS-IS as a light-weight control
   plane protocol for Network Virtualization over L3 (NVo3) overlay
   networks.  This light-weight control plane protocol is intended for
   small and even medium sized data center networks and is applicable to
   any specific NVo3 data encapsulation formats.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7364] discusses the need of an overlay-based network
   virtualization approach, referred to as Network Virtualization over
   Layer3 (NVo3), for providing multi-tenancy capabilities in large data
   centers networks and outlines the needs for a control plane protocol
   to facilitate running these NVo3 overlay networks.  [RFC7365]
   provides a framework for NVo3 overlay networks and meanwhile
   describes the needs for a control plane protocol to provide the
   following capabilities such as auto-provisioning/service discovery,
   address mapping advertisement and tunnel management.

   IS-IS protocol [IS-IS] is a much proven and well-known routing
   protocol which has been widely deployed in many large carrier
   networks and data center networks for many years.  Due to its
   extendibility, IS-IS protocol now is not only used for propagating IP
   reachability information in Layer3 networks (see [RFC1195]), but also
   used for propagating MAC reachability information in Layer2 networks
   or Layer2 overlay networks [RFC6165].

   This document accordingly proposes using IS-IS as a simple control
   plane protocol of NVo3 overlay networks which can be workable with
   any specific NVo3 data encapsulation formats such as MPLS-in-
   UDP[RFC7510], VXLAN [RFC7348], VXLAN-GPE [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe] ,
   MPLS-in-GRE [RFC4023] and NVGRE [RFC7637], It's no doubt that Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP) is more scalable than IS-IS and hence the
   former is more suitable to be used as a common NVo3 control plane in

   large data center network environments.  However, for some small and
   even medium sized data center networks, the complexity of BGP is
   perhaps too much and even unaffordable.  IS-IS -based common NVo3
   control plane could be a light-weight choice for these small and even
   medium data center networks where automating (e.g., no need for
   manually configuring BGP peers) and simplifying the network
   provisioning (e.g., only a single protocol to be deployed) is
   particularly important.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC7365] and
   [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture].

3.  VN Membership Auto-discovery

   By propagating the VN membership info among Network Virtualization
   Edges (NVEs), NVEs belonging to the same VN instance could discover
   one another automatically.  The VN membership info is carried in a VN
   Membership Info sub-TLV (as shown in Section 3.1) which is associated
   to a routable IP address of a NVE and MAY be present in any of the
   following TLVs originated by that NVE:

   1.  TLV-135 (IPv4) defined in [RFC5305]

   2.  TLV-236 (IPv6) defined in [RFC5308]

   When the above TLV is propagated across level boundaries, the VN
   Membership Info sub-TLV contained in that TLV SHOULD be kept.

3.1.  VN Membership Info Sub-TLV

   The VN Membership Info sub-TLV has the following format:

      VN ID: This field is filled with a 24-bit globally significant VN
      ID for a particular attached VN instance.

      Sub-domain ID: This field is filled with a 8-bit BIER sub-domain
      ID to which the VN has been associated
      [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture].  The field is only useful in the
      case where the Broadcast, Unknown-unicast and Multicast (BUM)
      packets within a VN are transported across the underlay by using
      the BIER forwarding mode.

      MPLS Label: This field is filled with a locally significant MPLS
      label associated with the VN ID.  This field is only meaningful in
      the case where MPLS labels are used for identifying specific VN
      instances that the encapsulated packets belong to.  Otherwise,
      this field MUST be set to zero.

4.  Tunnel Encapsulation Capability Advertisement

   To reach a consensus on what specific tunnel encapsulation format to
   be used between ingress and egress NVE pairs automatically, egress
   NVEs SHOULD advertise their own tunnel encapsulation capabilities by
   using the Encapsulation Capability sub-TLV as defined in
   [I-D.xu-isis-encapsulation-cap]

5.  VN MAC Reachability Info Advertisement

   For those Layer2 overlay approaches which adopts the control-plane
   based MAC address learning mechanism, MAC reachability information of
   a given VN instance would be exchanged across NVEs of that VN
   instance.  Upon learning MAC addresses of their local TES's somehow,
   NVEs SHOULD immediately advertise these MAC addresses to remote NVEs
   of the same VN instance by using the MAC-Reachability TLV as defined
   in [RFC6165].  One or more MAC-Reachability TLVs are carried in a LSP
   which in turn is encapsulated with an Ethernet header.  The source
   MAC address is the originating NVE's MAC address whereas the
   destination MAC address is a to-be-defined multicast MAC address
   specifically identifying all NVEs.  Such Ethernet frames containing
   IS-IS LSPs are forwarded towards remote NVEs as if they were customer
   multicast Ethernet frames.  Egress NVEs receiving the above frames
   SHOULD intercept them and accordingly process them.  The routable IP
   address of the NVE originating these MAC routes could be derived
   either from the "IP Interface Address" field contained in the
   corresponding LSPs (Note that the IP address here SHOULD be identical
   to the routable IP address associated with the VN membership Info) or
   from the tunnel source IP address of the NVo3 encapsulated packet
   containing such MAC routes.  Since these LSPs are fully transparent
   to core routers of the underlying networks (i.e., non-NVE routers),
   there is no impact on the control plane of core routers at all.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The type code for VN Membership Info sub-TLV is required to be
   allocated by IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document doesn't introduce additional security risk to IS-IS,
   nor does it provide any additional security feature for IS-IS.
