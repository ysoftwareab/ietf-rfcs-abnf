Abstract

   This memo provides extending information for electro-optical multi-
   layer network under the control of Generalized MPLS(GMPLS).  In
   particular we provide electro-optical conversion capability that
   describes the function between Optical Cross Connect(OXC) and Digital
   Cross Connect(DXC).  The information of electro-optical conversion
   capability is used for extending multi-layer network(MLN) information
   model and Wavelength Switched Optical network(WSON) information
   model.

1.  Introduction

   A multi-layer network (MLN) is a Traffic Engineering (TE) domain
   comprising multiple data plane switching layers either of the same
   ISC (e.g., TDM) or different ISC (e.g., TDM and PSC) and controlled
   by a single GMPLS control plane instance[RFC5212].  In a MLN, network
   elements may be single-switching-type-capable or multi-switching-
   type-capable nodes.  Single-switching-type-capable nodes have TE
   links with the same ISC value.  Multi-switching-type-capable nodes
   have TE links with the different ISCs value.  Nodes are classified as
   "simplex" or "hybrid" nodes.  A simplex node can terminate data links
   with different switching capabilities where each data link is
   connected to the node by a separate link interface.  A hybrid node
   can terminate data links with different switching capabilities where
   the data links are connected to the node by the same interface.

   Interface Switching Capability Descriptor(ISCD) is defined to
   describe the ISC of link RFC 4203 [RFC4203].  In a MLN without hybrid
   nodes, ISCs at both ends of the link are different if the link is
   between two different ISC nodes.  For example, [TDM, LSC] is a link
   between a Digital Cross Connect(DXC) and an Optical Cross
   Connect(OXC) RFC 4202 [RFC4202].  For a hybrid node, Interface
   Adjustment Capability Descriptor (IACD) is the capability of the
   internal adjustment capability between two link ends with different
   ISC.  For example, in a hybrid node with a DXC and a OXC that
   interconnect with the internal links, IACD will be add to the routing
   information of a TE link which ISC is LSC.

   Since optical network is block, so we need flood the block
   information in the optical network.  Wavelength Switched Optical
   Network(WSON) extend the block information.

   But electro-optical multi-layer network need more information.  This
   document defines the information extension of electro-optical
   network.


2.  Motivation

   A MLN with optical network and electronic network is shown in Figure
   1.

              Figure 1. Electro-optical multi-layer network.

   Node C is a hybrid node and other nodes are single-switching-type-
   nodes.  So we can get four paths: A-B-C-D, A-B-C-F-D, A-E-F-D,
   A-E-F-C-D.  In case that electro-optical conversion is at if-2, if-8,
   if-11 and the internal links within node c.  And in case the
   modulation type of if-2 and if-8 is DPSK and the modulation type of
   if-11 is DQPSK.  In node C, the modulation type of some internal
   links is DPSK and the modulation type of others is DQPSK.  So A-E-F-D
   is not available and others are not sure to be available.

   Since optical network is blocking, the blocking information need to
   be described.  The typical node model of optical network is shown if
   figure 2.

                     Figure 2.  ROADM model of Node C.

   WSON extends the blocking information, including connectivity,
   wavelength conversion capability and regeneration capability.  But
   from the WSON information model, there are no information that
   describes electro-optical conversion capability with add ports and
   drop ports.

   So we need extend MLN information model and WSON information model to
   apply for electro-optical network.


3.  Information extension

3.1.  Extending information

   In the optical network, optical transmitter(OT) and optical
   receiver(OR) are used for optical-electronic converting.  The
   characteristics of optical transmitter and optical receiver include
   tunable or not, tuning range, tuning time, modulation type, Forward
   Error Correction(FEC) type, signal type and so on.  Every
   characteristic is optional.  More than one type of modulation/FEC/
   signal can be supported by optical transmitter and optical receiver.

Internet-Draft            Information extension                July 2010


   The main extending information is electro-optical conversion
   information that includes wavelength tunable capability and signal
   processing capability.  Wavelength tunable capability describes the
   wavelength tuning technology of optical transmitter.  And signal
   processing capability describes the technology of electronic signal
   processing of optical transmitter or optical receiver.  Wavelength
   tunable capability includes tunable or not, tuning range and tuning
   time.  Signal processing capability includes FEC technology,
   modulation technology and electronic signal type.


   <Wavelength tunable capability>::=<Tunable><Tuning range><Tuning time>;
   <Electro-optical conversion capability>::=<FEC type list><Modulation type list><Signal type list>;


   For hybrid node, we need extend information of internal links.  And
   each internal link has a group of optical transmitter and optical
   receiver, so internal link information includes wavelength tunable
   capability and electro-optical conversion capability.


   <Internal link>::=<link ID><Wavelength tunable capability><Electro-optical conversion capability>;
   <Internal link list>:=<Internal link><Internal link list>;


3.2.  Extending mode

   In different scenarios, we have different extending modes.  In the
   electro-optical multi-layer network without hybrid nodes, there is a
   link between optical node and electronic node.  If optical
   transmitter and optical receiver are at optical node side port or
   electronic node side port, electro-optical conversion information
   will be add to the routing information of optical node side port or
   electronic node side port.  For example, if optical transmitter and
   optical receiver are at optical node side port, electro-optical
   conversion information will be add to the routing information of
   optical node side port.  This scenario is shown in figure 3.  And
   optical transmitter and optical receiver are at electronic node side
   port, electro-optical conversion information will be add to the
   routing information of electronic node side port.  This scenario is
   shown in figure 4.

                  Figure 5. OT and OR are at Hybrid node.

3.3.  Extending protocols

   There are some protocols which need be extended.

   o  OSPF or ISIS need be extended;

   o  Signal protocol need be extend to inform the internal link when
      LSP is creating;

   o  PCEP protocol need be extended to inform the internal link when
      PCE is used for path computation.


4.  Example

   We use modulation type for example.  For figure 1, the link
   information will be extended.


   <Link Info(if-2)>::=<ISCD(LSC)><Wavelength tunable capability ><electro-optical conversion capability(DPSK)>;
   <Link Info(if-8)>::=<ISCD(LSC)><Wavelength tunable capability ><electro-optical conversion capability(DPSK)>;
   <Link Info(if-11)>::=<ISCD(LSC)><Wavelength tunable capability ><electro-optical conversion capability(DQPSK)>;


   The hybrid node model is shown in figure 6.

   Path 1: A.1-B.2-B.3-C.4(-C.31)-C.5-D.6; In node C, the internal link
   31 is used.

   internal link 31 is used.


5.  Security Considerations

   The use of control plane protocols for signaling, routing, and path
   computation opens an electro-optical network to security threats
   through attacks on those protocols.  The data plane technology for an
   electro-optical network does not introduce any specific
   vulnerabilities, and so the control plane may be secured using the
   mechanisms defined for the protocols discussed.

   For further details of the specific security measures refer to the
   documents that define the protocols ([RFC3473], [RFC4203], [RFC4205],
   [RFC4204], and [RFC5440]).  [GMPLS-SEC] provides an overview of
   security vulnerabilities and protection mechanisms for the GMPLS
   control plane.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes not requests for IANA action.
