Internet-Draft                  IRTF RFCs                  February 2006


1.  Introduction

   This is proposal for a document process for the Internet Research
   Task Force (IRTF) [RFC2014].  Most documents undergoing this process
   will come from IRTF Research Groups and the objective is that they
   are published as RFCs by the RFC Editor.

   Currently, the IRTF Research Group drafts are treated like
   independent submissions by the RFC Editor.  Roughly, the process
   consists of the following steps:

   o  The document author submits an Internet Draft to the RFC Editor as
      an independent submission.

   o  The RFC Editor performs independent submission review (ISR) for
      editorial acceptability and may request the authors revise the
      document before publishing.

   o  The IESG performs a review (to avoid standards process end-
      arounds) and inserts a disclaimer (see RFC3932[RFC3932]).

   o  Independent submissions are delayed by lower priority treatment as
      they move through the RFC Editor's queue.

   This proposal changes the following:

   o  The RFC Editor's ISR review

   o  IRTF document publication priority in the RFC Editor queue

   o  The RFC3932 disclaimer placed on non-IETF documents by the
      Internet Engineering Steering Group

   The IRTF plans a trial of this process for several several documents
   after which this draft may be updated or published.

2.  Process Model

   The IRTF shall use the process for IETF-sponsored individual
   submissions (sometimes called AD-sponsored individual submissions) as
   a model for IRTF document handling.  From time to time, individuals
   will approach a member of the IESG to publish a document that is not
   the product of an IETF working group.  These documents do not receive
   RFC3932 disclaimers, do not receive low priority treatment by the RFC
   Editor, and do not experience ISR review.  However, they do receive a
   thorough review by the IESG.  For non-standards documents (yes, there
   are rare cases of non-wg standards documents), the sponsoring AD
   gives the document a thorough review, sometimes requiring expert
   reviews or IETF-wide last calls, if the topic seems to warrant broad
   review.  The bottom line is that a set of experienced, responsible
   folks give the document a thorough review before publishing it as an
   "IETF product".

   This proposal adapts the above process to the IRTF as described in
   the following sections.  The RFC Editor and the IAB have reviewed the
   procedure below and fully support it.

2.1.  Research Group Preparation

   An RG decides to publish a document using the IRTF publication track.
   The RG performs a review for editorial and technical content.  The
   document should have a statement in the abstract identifying the
   document as the product of the RG and a paragraph in the first
   section describing the level of support for the document (e.g., "this
   document represents the consensus of the FOOBAR RG", "the views in
   this document were considered controversial by the FOOBAR RG but the
   RG reached a consensus that the document should still be published")
   and the breadth of review for the document.  I.e., was this document
   read by all the active contributors, 3 people, or folks who are not
   "in" the RG but are expert in the area?  It should also be very clear
   throughout the document that it is not an IETF product and is not a
   standard.  If an experimental protocol is described appropriate
   caveats need to be present.

2.2.  Document Shepherds

   Documents should have a shepherd.  This is a relatively new concept
   developed in the IETF to ensure that issues raised in the review and
   publication process (e.g., by the IESG and RFC Editor) are responded
   to in a timely manner.  The IETF shepherding process is described in
   [I-D.ietf-proto-wgchair-doc-shepherding] and should be adapted to the
   IRTF publication process as some items in the draft will not apply.

2.3.  Submission to the IRSG

   The sponsoring RG chair brings the document to the IRSG for
   publication.  The expectation is that the RG chair has already
   reviewed the draft thoroughly and considers it of publishable quality
   editorially and technically.  The RG should be copied on the mail
   message requesting IRSG review.

2.4.  IRSG Review

   A (firm) eight-week IRSG review period follows after which a poll is
   taken.  Reviews should be similar to that for a conference paper.
   Votes can be:

   o  'ready to publish' -- requires a thorough read and reasonably
      detailed review

   o  'not ready to publish' -- requires a thorough read, reasonably
      detailed review, and actionable comments.

   o  'no objection' -- I don't object if this document goes forward;
      I've read the document (perhaps quickly); I have some small
      comments which are not show stoppers; I don't have great expertise
      in the area.

   o  'request more time to review' -- a commitment to to provide a
      thorough review in a specified period of time.

   Reviews should be written to be public.  In particular, they should
   be sent to the submitted RG mailing list.  (We may need a tracker of
   some sort to collect reviews.)

   At least two other IRSG members (besides the one sponsoring the
   document) need to vote 'ready to publish' for the document to move
   forward.  Any vote of 'not ready to publish' will hold a document's
   progress until the comments are addressed.  The IRTF chair may choose
   to override 'not ready to publish' holds that, in the opinion of the
   chair, have received an adequate response.

2.5.  RFC Editor Handling

   The document is submitted to the RFC Editor who does not perform an
   ISR review.  The RFC Editor sends it to the IESG for an RFC3932
   review.  There are several reasons why the IESG may block a document,
   described in RFC3932 section 4.  (The document shepherd should be
   responsible for checking the IETF datatracker for IESG blocking and
   non-blocking comments and forward them to the RG.)

2.6.  IESG Handling

   Rather than the disclaimers found in RFC3932, the IESG will instruct
   the RFC Editor to add the following disclaimer:

        "This RFC is a product of the Internet Research Task Force and
         is not a candidate for any level of Internet Standard.  The
         IRTF publishes the results of Internet-related research and
         development activities.  These results might not be suitable
         for deployment."

   For documents that specify a protocol or other technology, and that
   have been considered in the IETF at one time:


         "This RFC is a product of the Internet Research Task Force.
         The content of this RFC was at one time considered by the
         IETF, and therefore it may resemble a current IETF work in
         progress or a published IETF work.  However, this is not an
         IETF document is not a candidate for any level of Internet
         Standard.  The IRTF publishes the results of Internet-related
         research and development activities.  These results might not
         be suitable for deployment."

   (These disclaimers will require approval by the IESG.)

2.7.  Exiting

   The document enters the RFC Editor queue at the same priority as IETF
   documents.  The document shepherd is responsible for ensuring that
   the document authors are responsive to the RFC Editor and that the
   RFC editing process goes smoothly.
