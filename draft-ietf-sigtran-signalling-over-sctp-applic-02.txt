1 INTRODUCTION


     Transport of telephony signalling requires special considerations.
In order to use SCTP, special care must be taken to meet the perfor-
mance, timing and failure management requirements.


1.1 Terminology


     The following terms are commonly identified in related work:


     Association:  SCTP connection between two endpoints.

     Stream:  A uni-directional logical channel established within an

     association, within which all user messages are delivered in
     sequence except for those submitted to the unordered delivery ser-
     vice.


1.2 Overview


SCTP provides a general purpose, reliable transport between two end-
points.

The following functions are provided by SCTP:

     - Reliable Data Transfer

     - Multiple streams to help avoid head-of-line blocking

     - Ordered and unordered data delivery on a per-stream basis

     - Bundling and fragmentation of user data

     - Congestion and flow control

     - Support continuous monitoring of reachability

     - Graceful termination of association

     - Support of multi-homing for added reliability

     - Protection against blind denial-of-service attacks

     - Protection against blind masquerade attacks

     Telephony Signalling transport over IP normally uses the  following
     architecture:

     The components of the protocol stack are :

(1)  Adaptation modules are used when the telephony application needs to
     preserve an existing primitive interface. (e.g. management indica-
     tions, data operation primitives, ... for a particular
     user/application protocol).


(2)  SCTP, specially configured to meet the telephony application per-
     formance requirements.


(3)  The standard Internet Protocol.


2  Applicability of Telephony Signalling transport using SCTP


SCTP can be used as the transport protocol for telephony applications.
Message boundaries are preserved during data transport and so no message
delineation is needed. The user data can be delivered by the order of
transmission within a stream(in sequence delivery) or the order of
arrival.

SCTP can be used to provide redundancy and fault tolerance at the tran-
sport layer and below. Telephony applications needing this level of
fault tolerance can make use of SCTP's multi-homing support.

SCTP can be used for telephony applications where head-of-line blocking
is a concern. Such an application should use multiple streams to provide

independent ordering of telephony signalling messages.


3 Issues for transporting telephony signalling over SCTP


3.1 Congestion Control


The basic mechanism of congestion control in SCTP have been described in
[RFC2960]. SCTP congestion control sometimes conflicts with the timing
requirements of telephony signalling transport.

In an engineered network (e.g. a private intranet), in which network
capacity and maximum traffic is very well understood, some telephony
signalling applications may choose to relax the congestion control rules
in order to satisfy the timing requirements. But this should be done
without destabilising the network, otherwise this would lead to poten-
tial congestion collapse of the network.

Some telephony signalling applications may have their own congestion
control and flow control techniques. These techniques may interact with
the congestion control procedures in SCTP.  Additionally, telephony
applications may use SCTP stream based flow control [SCTPFLOW].


3.2 Detection of failures

Telephony systems often must achieve high availability in operation. For
example, they are often required to be able to preserve stable calls
during a component failure. Therefore error situations at the transport
layer and below must be detected very fast so that the application can
take approriate steps to recover and preserve the stable calls. This
poses special requirements on SCTP to discover unreachablility of a des-
tination address or a peer.


3.2.1 Retransmission TimeOut (RTO) calculation

The SCTP protocol parameter RTO.Min value has a direct impact on the
calculation of the RTO itself. Some telephony applications want to lower
the value of the RTO.Min to less than 1 second. This would allow the
message sender to reach the maximum number-of-retransmission threshold
faster in the case of network failures. However, lowering RTO.Min may
have a negative impact on network behaviour [ALLMAN99].

In some rare cases, telephony applications might not want to use the
exponential timer back-off concept in RTO calculation in order to speed



Coene, et al.                Informational                      [Page 5]





Draft         Telephony Signalling Transport over SCTP AS  December 2000


up failure detection. The danger of doing this is that, when network
congestion occurs, not backing off the timer may worsen the congestion
situation. Therefore, this strategy should never be used in public
Internet.

It should be noted that not using delayed SACK will also help faster
failure detection.


3.2.2 Heartbeat

For faster detection of (un)availability of idle paths, the telephony
application may consider lowering the SCTP parameter HB.interval. It
should be noted this will result in a higher traffic load.


3.2.3 Maximum number of retransmissions

Setting Path.Max.Retrans and Association.Max.Retrans SCTP parameters to
lower values will speed up both destination address and peer failure
detection. However, if these values are set too low, the probability of
false detections will increase.


3.3 Shorten end-to-end message delay

Telephony applications often require short end-to-end message delays.
The methods described in section 3.2.1 on lowering RTO and not using
delayed SACK may be considered.


3.4 Bundling considerations

Bundling small telephony signalling messages at transmission helps
improve the bandwidth usage efficiency of the network. On the downside,
bundling may introduce additional delay to some of the messages. This
should be taken into consideration when end-to-end delay is a concern.


3.5 Stream Usage

Telephony signalling traffic is often composed of multiple, independent
message sequences. It is highly desirable to transfer those independent
message sequences in separate SCTP streams. This reduces the probability
of head-of-line blocking in which the retransmission of a lost message
affects the delivery of other messages not belonging to the same message
sequence.

Draft         Telephony Signalling Transport over SCTP AS  December 2000


4 Security considerations


SCTP only tries to increase the availability of a network. SCTP does not
contain any protocol mechanisms which are directly related to user mes-
sage authentication, integrity and confidentiality functions. For such
features, it depends on the IPSEC protocols and architecture and/or on
security features of its user protocols.

Mechanisms for reducing the risk of blind denial-of-service attacks and
masquerade attacks are built into SCTP protocol. See RFC2960, section 11
for detailed information.

Currently the IPSEC working group is investigating the support of mul-
tihoming by IPSEC protocols. At the present time to use IPSEC, one must
use 2 * N * M security associations if one endpoint uses N addresses and
the other M addresses.
