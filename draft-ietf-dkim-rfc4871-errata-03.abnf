d=  The domain of the signing entity (plain-text; REQUIRED).  This is
       the domain that will be queried for the public key.  This domain
       MUST be the same as or a parent domain of the "i=" tag (the
       signing identity, as described below), or it MUST meet the
       requirements for parent domain signing described in Section 3.8.
       When presented with a signature that does not meet these
       requirement, verifiers MUST consider the signature invalid.

       Internationalized domain names MUST be encoded as described in
       [RFC3490].

       ABNF:

sig-d-tag       = %x64 [FWS] "=" [FWS] domain-name
domain-name     = sub-domain 1*("." sub-domain)
                   ; from RFC 2821 Domain, but excluding address-literal

d=

         Specifies the SDID claiming responsibility for an introduction
         of a message into the mail stream (plain-text; REQUIRED).  This
         is the domain that will be queried for the public key.  The
         SDID MUST correspond to a valid DNS name under which the DKIM
         key record is published.  The conventions and semantics used by
         a signer to create and use a specific SDID are outside the
         scope of the DKIM Signing specification, as is any use of those
         conventions and semantics.  When presented with a signature
         that does not meet these requirements, verifiers MUST consider
         the signature invalid.

         Internationalized domain names MUST be encoded as described in
         [RFC3490].

         ABNF:

sig-d-tag   = %x64 [FWS] "=" [FWS] domain-name
domain-name = sub-domain 1*("." sub-domain)
                 ; from RFC 2821 Domain, but excluding
                   address-literal


i=  Identity of the user or agent (e.g., a mailing list manager) on
       behalf of which this message is signed (dkim-quoted-printable;
       OPTIONAL, default is an empty Local-part followed by an "@"
       followed by the domain from the "d=" tag).  The syntax is a
       standard email address where the Local-part MAY be omitted.  The
       domain part of the address MUST be the same as or a subdomain of
       the value of the "d=" tag.

       Internationalized domain names MUST be converted using the steps
       listed in Section 4 of [RFC3490] using the "ToASCII" function.

       ABNF:

sig-i-tag =
                  %x69 [FWS] "=" [FWS] [ Local-part ] "@" domain-name

i=







         The Agent or User Identifier (AUID) on behalf of which the SDID
         is taking responsibility (dkim-quoted-printable; OPTIONAL,
         default is an empty Local-part followed by an "@" followed by
         the domain from the "d=" tag).

         The syntax is a standard email address where the Local-part MAY
         be omitted.  The domain part of the address MUST be the same
         as, or a subdomain of the value of, the "d=" tag.

         Internationalized domain names MUST be converted using the
         steps listed in Section 4 of [RFC3490] using the "ToASCII"
         function.

         ABNF:

sig-i-tag =  %x69 [FWS] "=" [FWS]
                [ Local-part ] "@" domain-name

         The AUID is specified as having the same syntax as an email
         address, but is not required to have the same semantics.
         Notably, the domain name is not required to be registered in
         the DNS -- so it might not resolve in a query -- and the Local-
         part MAY be drawn from a namespace that does not contain the
         user's mailbox.  The details of the structure and semantics for
         the namespace are determined by the Signer.  Any knowledge or
         use of those details by verifiers or assessors is outside the
         scope of the DKIM Signing specification.  The Signer MAY choose
         to use the same namespace for its AUIDs as its users' email
         addresses, or MAY choose other means of representing its users.
         However, the signer SHOULD use the same AUID for each message
         intended to be evaluated as being within the same sphere of
         responsibility, if it wishes to offer receivers the option of
         using the AUID as a finer grained, stable identifier than the
         SDID.

         INFORMATIVE NOTE: The Local-part of the "i=" tag is optional
         because in some cases a signer may not be able to establish a
         verified individual identity.  In such cases, the signer might
         wish to assert that although it is willing to go as far as
         signing for the domain, it is unable or unwilling to commit to
         an individual user name within their domain.  It can do so by
         including the domain part but not the Local-part of the
         identity.
