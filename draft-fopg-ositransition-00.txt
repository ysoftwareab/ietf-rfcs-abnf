1.  Status

This working document is a DRAFT intended for review.   Com-
ments are encouraged.


2.  Introduction

The intent of this document is to provide technical descrip-
tions  of the issues involved in the integration of the Open
Systems Interconnect (OSI) protocols  into  the  operational
networks which interconnect and comprise the "Internet". The
issues raised and solutions discussed are a  result  of  the
Federal  Networking Council (FNC) OSI Planning Group (FOPG).
The members of the FOPG represent several Federal Government
agencies  such  as  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE),  the
National Science Foundation (NSF) the  National  Aeronautics
and  Space  Administration (NASA), the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) under the Department of Com-
merce, as well as University experts.

The Internet is composed of many networks.  Some are  funded
privately  and  some  are funded by the U.S. Government, yet
all currently  use  the  Transport  Communications  Protocol
(TCP)/Internet  Protocol  (IP) [2,3] and can communicate via
some physical connection point.   Other  networks  use  dif-
ferent  protocols  that  physically  connect,  yet  they are
essentially disjoint because the protocols they use  do  not
interoperate  transparently with TCP/IP.  As both non-TCP/IP
networks and the Internet begin to use OSI, the interconnec-
tivity  expands  and hence the size of the Internet.  There-
fore, OSI integration  into  the  non-TCP/IP  networks  that
interconnect,  specifically  the  large DECnet* networks, is
considered as well.

*DECnet is a trade mark of Digital Equipment Corporation

It is recognized that there is a commitment to integrate OSI










                    DRAFT FOPG-OSI Spec        July 23, 1990


into  many  networks  that compose the Internet, however, it
must also be recognized that there  is  typically  a  higher
commitment  to  continue providing existing network services
to users.  There are key pieces missing from the OSI infras-
tructure  such  as inter-domain routing, directory/name ser-
vice and network management.  The missing components coupled
with the installed user base of TCP/IP will prevent OSI from
supplanting the TCP/IP protocol  suite.   As  a  result,  in
addition  to  the  integration  of  OSI, there will be coex-
istence and interoperability amongst OSI, TCP/IP and  poten-
tially DECnet for the indefinite future.

Despite the current difficulties, there  is  large  momentum
behind  the  OSI development, and it is anticipated to be in
wide use eventually.  Some of the most  optimistic  specula-
tion  has  been  that OSI will be in predominate use 5 years
from now, while the more pessimistic speculation is that  it
will take another 10 years.

The integration and transition of any new protocols  into  a
large  established  network base will require adjustments or
fine tuning to the protocols themselves as well  as  to  how
they  are used.  This is a normal expectation for changes of
this magnitude.  Throughout this paper an attempt is made to
identify  the  issues and potential problems that will arise
as the new OSI protocols are integrated.  This is considered
an important part of the initial planning stage.

2.1.  Scope and Objectives

Each administration responsible for their networks may  have
their  own policy and guidelines for the integration of OSI.
Due to the diversity of existing administrations,  networks,
and  users, it is nearly impossible to generate a common OSI
integration plan.  Administrations serving user  communities
with  different requirements may require different solutions
that are specific to their particular needs.

Therefore, this document does not contain "The OSI  Integra-
tion  Plan".   Rather,  it  attempts  to address the various
issues and scenarios that may  arise  in  the  general  case
i.e.,  coexistence  and  interoperability between TCP/IP and
OSI.

The objectives of this paper are to provide:


+    A  compendium  of  coexistence   and   interoperability
     issues.


+    A summary of solutions to the various  coexistence  and
     interoperability  issues.  This includes an analysis of

     each solution as well as an indication of  issues  that
     require work and are currently lacking resources.

3.  THE CURRENT AND FUTURE INTERNET

It is important to  understand  the  state  of  the  current
TCP/IP  Internet while analyzing the subsequent issues.  The
current model of the evolving Internet is based around three
components:  high  speed backbones, large regional networks,
and local site networks. The local area networks connect  to
regional networks. In turn, the regional networks connect to
the high speed backbones.  There are variations, e.g.,  some
local sites have direct high speed backbone connections, and
many regionals interconnect to each other through  "backdoor
routes".   In  fact, the number of connections is increasing
resulting in a meshed environment, even  though  there  have
been successful attempts to consolidate links.

The backbones are government  funded  networks,  where  some
have multi-protocol requirements.  For example, both DOE and
NASA backbones have multi-protocol mission support  require-
ments  for  TCP/IP  and  DECnet.   Most of the backbones are
planning to start carrying operational ISO 8473  []  traffic
in either 1990 or early 1991.

Regional networks, though originally funded by  the  govern-
ment,  are  tending to become privately operated.  Regionals
will likely provide operational ISO 8473 forwarding capabil-
ities as user requirements become apparent.

Most OSI software (including a full OSI stack)  can  operate
on  a  local  area network. However, a lack of user require-
ments for operational OSI software has slowed the deployment
of OSI on local area networks.


4.  Looking Towards OSI

Rapid transition from TCP/IP to OSI is not likely to  occur.
Rather,  it is anticipated that an extended period will take
place  during  which  both  protocol  suites  will   be   in
widespread  use.   This  will  require  both coexistence and
interoperability between the two protocol suites.


4.1.  Coexistence

Coexistence among protocol suites occurs when separate  pro-
tocols  run  simultaneously on the same network. Coexistence
options vary from running dual protocol stacks to  operating
physically separate networks.

Physically separate networks are usually not practical since
they   require   separate  circuits,  devices,  routers  and
resources in general. This is (typically)  incongruous  with
the strong cost incentive to share physical resources.


                                                      Page 4







                    DRAFT FOPG-OSI Spec        July 23, 1990


Dual protocol stacks can run in parallel in  an  end  system
and/or an intermediate system. Dual protocol (or multiproto-
col in general) schemes are usually cost  effective  because
they  allow  two  or  more software stacks to share the same
physical resources. However, this may lead to an increase in
the  number  of resources required by the machine and in the
complexity of the operational management of two  essentially
separate networks.


4.2.  Interoperability

Interoperability becomes an issue when the two end points of
a  communication path do not use the same protocol suite. In
this situation, a conversion mechanism is required to bridge
the gap between the two protocols.

Interoperability issues arise at many layers.  For  example,
two  machines  may have the same application protocol suite,
but have incompatible network layer protocols. On the  other
hand, two machines may share a compatible network layer pro-
tocol, but have incompatible applications.

Interoperability may require that the user be aware  of  the
presence  of  two protocol suites.  In the long run, this is
unacceptable on a large scale.


4.3.  Mixed Protocol Environment

In a mixed environment, more  than  one  protocol  stack  is
used.  The  stack  itself  may  be mixed, e.g., TCP/IP lower
layers and OSI upper layers.  It may also be an  environment
where  a pure protocol stack is trying to communicate with a
mixed or different protocol stack, e.g., an OSI  end  system
trying  to  communicate  with another end system running OSI
applications with TCP/IP lower layers.


5.  Status of Issues by Protocol Layer

The following sections, categorized by protocol layer,  dis-
cuss OSI and TCP/IP coexistence and interoperability.


5.1.  Physical Layer

There are no known physical layer issues  that  need  to  be
resolved.






                                                      Page 5







                    DRAFT FOPG-OSI Spec        July 23, 1990


5.2.  Data Link Layer

The Government OSI Profile (GOSIP) Version 2.0  [20]  speci-
fies  3  data  link layer protocols: 1) High Level Data Link
Communication (HDLC) Link Access Procedure  B  (LAP  B),  in
conjunction  with  X.25 (ISO 7776) and Pt-Pt subnetworks; 2)
ISO 8802/2 (LLC 1)  in  conjunction  with  ISO  8802/3,  ISO
8802/4,  or  ISO  8802/5;  and 3) Q.921 for operation on the
ISDN D channel and ISO 7776 (LAP B) for operation on ISDN  B
channels.

The Internet standard data link layer is the Point to  Point
Protocol (PPP) [22].


5.2.1.  Coexistence Issue: OSI and IP over HDLC

Status: resolved.

OSI and IP packets may be distinguished on an HDLC  link  by
examining the Network Layer Protocol ID (NLPID) field of the
HDLC or X.25 header.  NLIPDs have been assigned for  IP  and
ISO  8473.   This  allows both protocols to run over HDLC or
over HDLC/X.25.


5.2.2.  Coexistence Issue: OSI and IP over 802.x

Status: resolved.

OSI and IP packets may be distinguished on  802.2  links  by
examining  the Destination Service Access Point (DSAP) field
in the 802.2 header. DSAP values have been assigned for  OSI
packets as well as IP packets.


5.2.3.  Coexistence Issue: OSI and IP over PPP

Status: work and resources needed.

PPP indicates what type  of  protocol  follows  in  a  field
within  the  PPP header.  Currently a value is defined indi-
cating IP as the next layer protocol.  There is some minimal
work  needed to specify a next level protocol value indicat-
ing ISO 8473.

5.3.  Network Layer

Several pieces of the OSI network layer such as the specifi-
cation  of CLNP, and the ES-IS routing protocol are complete
and provide the transmission of OSI network layer data  over
local  area  networks.  However, for the network layer to be
used on a  wide  scale,  IS-IS  routing  protocols  must  be


                                                      Page 6







                    DRAFT FOPG-OSI Spec        July 23, 1990


deployed.


5.3.1.  Operational Issue: OSI Intra-domain IS-IS protocol

Status: in progress.

The IS-IS intra-domain  dynamic  routing  protocol  [25]  is
currently  a Draft Proposal in the ISO/IEC standards organi-
zations.  IS-IS for ISO 8473 is  being  progressed  rapidly,
and  is  anticipated  to become an International Standard in
1991.


5.3.2.  Coexistence Issue:  Integrated  or  Parallel  Intra-
domain protocols

Status: work and resources needed.

Widespread deployment of both IP and CLNP require the opera-
tion  of  a  routing  protocol. Two basic approaches to this
problem have been identified. In the  integrated  approach,a
single routing protocol is deployed which supports the rout-
ing of both IP and CLNP packets. In the  Parallel  approach,
two distinct, independent protocols are operated.

A detailed analysis of these  two  approaches  is  required.
This  analysis must address the advantages and disadvantages
of each approach and  recommend  the  conditions  when  each
approach is favorable.


5.3.3.  Operational Issue: Intra-domain IS-IS for Dual Use

Status: in progress.

The IETF IS-IS working group is working on integrated  rout-
ing  for  both  IP and ISO 8473.  There is an Internet Draft
RFC which is expected to become an RFC in mid 1990.


5.3.4.  Operational Issue: Inter-domain Routing

Status: in progress, resources needed.

There is a draft specification of  an  Inter-Domain  Routing
Protocol  (IDRP)  for consideration as the U.S. contribution
to the ISO/IEC standards committees.  The  previous  efforts
by  ECMA  and the development of the Boarder Router Protocol
(BRP) contributed to form the basis for this IDRP.

There is also an Internet effort  for  inter-domain  routing
based on source routing.  It has the added feature of policy


                                                      Page 7







                    DRAFT FOPG-OSI Spec        July 23, 1990


based routing.  It is not clear how these  two  efforts  can
relate to each other.

Static, manually updated tables will be used  in  the  short
term for inter-domain routing in an ISO 8473 Internet.  This
will be required until  there  is  either  an  International
Standard  for  an  IDRP  or  until an interim IDRP is agreed
upon, implemented and commercially available.

Static tables are unacceptable on a large scale  because  of
the  requirement  for human intervention to re-route traffic
in the event of link failure, and because of the extra  bur-
den caused in maintaining large routing tables manually.

It is expected that the lack of an IDRP will greatly  reduce
the  deployment  of  the  OSI Connectionless Network Service
(CLNS).  Thus, there is an urgent requirement for an interim
IDRP agreement and implementation.


5.3.5.  Operational Issue: NSAP Format

Status: in progress.

Structure for the Domain Specific Part (DSP) of the  Network
Service  Access  Point  (NSAP)  address  has been defined in
GOSIP Version 2.0.

The GOSIP format is solidified  pending  GOSIP  Version  2.0
final  release.  (GOSIP Version 1.0 [] will have errata that
specifies the GOSIP Version 2.0 NASAP address format.)   The
lower  portion  of  the DSP has structure that is compatible
with the IS-IS intra-domain routing  protocol  requirements.
The  GOSIP  Version  2.0  format  should  be  used for those
administrations which are getting their address  assignments
from the US government address space.

ANSI also assigns NSAPS with a format that has no  structure
imposed  on  the  DSP.  These addresses will be used by non-
government networks.  A common structure such as defined  in
GOSIP Version 2.0 should be adopted and used.


5.3.6.  Operational Issue: NSAP Guidelines

Status: in progress.

The NSAP working group in the IETF is working on  guidelines
regarding  OSI  addressing.  Results may be submitted to the
OSI Implementors Workshop  and  become  part  of  the  GOSIP
Users' Guide for GOSIP Version 2.0.

See Appendix ? for details of these guidelines.

                    DRAFT FOPG-OSI Spec        July 23, 1990


5.3.7.  Operational Issue: ISO 8473 Echo

Status: in progress.

The IETF has completed work on an  ISO  8473  echo  function
[23].   It  must be supported in order to get it through the
ISO/IEC standards committees.  This Protocol is considered a
vital tool for simple network operational support.


5.3.8.  Coexistence Issue: CLNS/CONS Interoperability

Status: in progress, resources needed.

It is anticipated that there will be wide spread use of  the
connection-less  and connection-oriented network services. A
solution to this problem must be reached. An  ISO  technical
report [21] specifies a possible solution.


5.4.  Transport Layer

Transport relays (or gateways or bridges) have been proposed
as  both  a coexistence and an interoperation strategy. This
is discussed in a later section.


5.5.  Session and Presentation

No work is needed.  The Session and Presentation Layers  for
the OSI suite operate independently of the TCP/IP suite.


5.6.  Electronic Mail

There are several issues relating to the operation of  X.400
(the  OSI  electronic  mail system) and coexistence of X.400
and RFC 822 mail systems.


5.6.1.  Operational Issue: X.400 routing

Status: in progress.

There is some work in the NIST X.400 SIG on routing of X.400
messages between MTAs. <TODO: get info from stef on this>


5.6.2.  Interoperation Issue: An X.400/RFC 822 gateway

Status: in progress.

The specification of an RFC 822/X.400 gateway is RFC 987/RFC


                                                      Page 9

1148


5.6.3.  Operational Issue: Structure of X.400 addresses

Status: in progress, resources needed.

In order to deploy X.400 in  the  Internet,  Internet  X.400
users  must  be  given  X.400  addresses.  How  should these
addresses be constructed? The two basic choices are to  con-
struct  X.400  addresses based upon X.400 naming guidelines,
or to construct X.400 addresses based upon existing RFC  822
addresses.

In general, the recommended  practice  is  to  create  X.400
addresses  that  are  meaningful  to  the  organization (and
without regard to any preassigned RFC 822 addresses).


5.6.4.  Operational Issue: Use of the PRMD/ADMD field

Status: needs work, resources needed.

The US must make a policy decision on the use of blank  ADMD
fields  and  the  registration  of  PRMD  names.  Lack  of a
national policy regarding  these  attributes  will  lead  to
chaos  as  government,  private,  and  public X.400 networks
become interconnected.

An initiative with the US State Department (Study Groups  A-
D)  has  been  formed  to oversee the creation of the proper
committee to study this issue. (See Stef).


5.6.5.  Interoperation Issue: Identification of the users

Status: in progress, resources needed.

A small but growing population of users in the U.S. Internet
are  starting  to  use  X.400.   These  X.400  users must be
addressable by RFC822 mail users.  RFC987 and RFC1148  gate-
ways  exist that allow translation and mapping between X.400
and RFC822 messages.  One strategy that  European  countries
have  taken is to define MX records that appear to be normal
RFC822 addresses, but which actually point to an RFC987/1148
gateway  to  translate  messages into the X.400 world.  This
gives X.400 users an Internet-style address that is concise,
easy   to  type,  and  consistent  with  tradition  Internet
addresses.

Another strategy is to embed the X.400  address  within  the
RFC 822 syntax.



                                                     Page 10







                    DRAFT FOPG-OSI Spec        July 23, 1990


Looking toward the future, it would be delightful if a  user
could  use  a  common,  natural address syntax for all mail,
whether sent to an X.400 system, or to an  RFC  822  system.
The X.500 directory is a key to this situation.

A strategy for the Internet  must  be  discussed  and  docu-
mented.


5.6.6.  Operational Issue: 987/1148 mapping table support

Status: in progress, resources needed.

Complex operation of an 987/1148 gateway requires the global
distribution  of  static  address  mapping  information. The
current practice of manual distribution will not  scale.  An
experimental use of the DNS to store the mapping information
has been undertaken at the University of Wisconsin.  Storage
of the mapping information in the DNS allows the information
to be stored in a distributed manner.

The use of the DNS to support RFC 987/1148 mapping  informa-
tion must be reviewed and documented.


5.6.7.  Operational Issue: 987/1148 gateway security

Status: work and resources needed.

There is considerable work in both the  Internet  (RFC  822)
community  and  the  ISO  (X.400)  community on security for
electronic mail. It does not appear that there has been  any
serious study of how a mail gateway affects the two security
models.


5.7.  Virtual Terminal Protocol

Status: This section needs to be reviewed by a VTP expert

The Virtual Terminal Protocol VTP  is  the  OSI  version  of
remote login.  There has been a VTP profile written, that is
similar to the Internet TELNET protocol.  There currently is
an  implementation  of  this, where both the OSI VTP and the
Internet TELNET can run in the same host. This results in an
application  relay running directly in the host, thereby by-
passing the added  complication  of  determining  where  the
application  gateway  is  located.   A user can login to the
host via either VTP or TELNET and from there  perform  addi-
tional remote logins to other machines with either TELNET or
VTP.

There is also another profile which is more in tune with the


                                                     Page 11







                    DRAFT FOPG-OSI Spec        July 23, 1990


International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee
(CCITT) recommendation for the terminal standard X.3,  X.28,
and  X.29.  The functionality is very similar to TELNET.  In
addition, there is a third generic VTP profile.

In regards to the user locating the application gateway, one
solution  is  to  require a two step login.  The user expli-
citly logs into the application gateway via  VTP  or  TELNET
and from there uses TELNET or VTP to get to another destina-
tion.


5.8.  File Transfer

Status: This section needs to be reviewed by a FTAM expert

There is <??> work being  done  on  an  application  gateway
between  the OSI File Transfer, Access and Management (FTAM)
[] and the Internet File Transfer Protocol (FTP) [].

As in the VTP and TELNET scenario, it is feasible for a user
use  a  two  step approach. For file transfer it is a burden
since multiple file transfers may be  executed  in  a  login
session as well as in application software.


6.  Issues Spanning Multiple Layers

6.1.  Directory Services


6.1.1.  Operational Issue: organization of the name space

Status: work and resources needed.

Currently there is work being done in the X.500  OSI  Imple-
mentors  Workshop.  In addition, an IETF X.500 working group
has been started.


6.1.2.  Coexistence Issue: Multi-Stack protocol selection

Status: work and resources needed.

A dual stack end system must select which protocol stack  to
use  when  trying  to  get to a specific remote location via
directory service query.  Thus, the  directory  system  must
contain  information  to aid in protocol stack selection. In
addition, the directory must provide some aid in the  inden-
tification  a  gateway if the two end systems do not share a
common protocol stack.

This topic is in the scope of the IETF X.500 working group.

6.1.3.  Coexistence Issue:  Interoperability  between  X.500
and the Internet DNS

Status: work and resources needed.

This topic is in the scope of the IETF X.500 working group.


6.2.  Security, Access Control and Authentication

Status: work and resources needed.

Multi-protocol secuity issues have not been  studied.   How-
ever,  it  is likely that multi-stack interoperability prob-
lems will result if the security  for  IP-only  environments
and  security  for  OSI-only environments is not integrated.
Coordination between the IP  and  OSI  security  efforts  is
necessary  to  ensure  security  when trying to interoperate
between the two electronic mail services.


6.3.  Network Management

Status: dazed and confused.

The IETF is defining how to use the Simple  Network  Manage-
ment  Protocol  (SNMP)  to manage pure OSI systems.  This is
likely to lead to confusion.

This section needs review by an expert  in  network  manage-
ment.

7.  Strategies and Scenarios

In the follow sections, various  coexistence  scenarios  are
examined.   Each  scenario  is defined by type of the source
and destination protocol stack. In order to keep the  combi-
nations  under  control,  the  following  types  of protocol
stacks are defined:






                                                     Page 14

    Network Layer                              Application Suite
    

    TCP/IP                                     OSI
    TCP/IP                                     Internet
    CLNS-OSI                                   OSI
    CONS-OSI                                   OSI


The combination of TCP/IP Network Layers  and  OSI  applica-
tions  is  accomplished  according  to  RFC  1006 [24]. This
mechanism operates the TP0 protocol,  along  with  a  simple
packetization  protocol  on top of the TCP/IP, which is used
as a connection-oriented network service.  With the RFC 1006
approach,  OSI  applications can establish a connection over
any TCP/IP network.

The first  stack  definition  (TCP/IP  Network  Layers,  OSI
Applications)  includes  both  an RFC 1006 mixed stack and a
pure stack OSI system connected to an OSI LAN (where the LAN
is surrounded by TCP/IP-only capable routers).

Of the possible 16 possible combinations of source and  des-
tination pairs, some are non-issues since they do not result
in a mixed stack environment, such as a TCP/IP host communi-
cating  with  another  TCP/IP  host over an IP network.  The
important cases are:


    Case Source                         Destination
         Stack                          Stack
    

    1    [TCP/IP Net,   Internet Appl]  [TCP/IP Net,   OSI Appl]
    2    [TCP/IP Net,   Internet Appl]  [CLNS-OSI Net, OSI Appl]
    3    [TCP/IP Net,   OSI Appl]       [CLNS-OSI Net, OSI Appl]
    4    [TCP/IP Net,   OSI Appl]       [CONS-OSI Net, OSI Appl]
    5    [CLNS-OSI Net, OSI Appl]       [CONS-OSI Net, OSI Appl]



These are only the simplest of cases. More complicated tran-
sit cases may arise where different networks are in the mid-
dle. These cases are discussed in a later section.


7.1.  Case 1

This case requires an application layer gateway.







                                                     Page 15







                    DRAFT FOPG-OSI Spec        July 23, 1990


7.2.  Case 2

Case two requires an application gateway with the added bur-
den of an interoperability problem at the network layer. The
most likely solution to this problem requires an application
gateway  with  two network layer protocols (IP Net and CLNS-
OSI Net).

ADVANTAGES:

o No modification to the end system software

DISADVANTAGES:

o Performance degradation, especially apparent  in  interac-
tive mode.

o Locating the application gateway is an issue for  the  end
system.

o Functionality loss if one application has greater capabil-
ities and hence do not map to the other application.


7.3.  Case 3

Case three can be solved with a transport relay (or  network
layer encapsulation if the [TCP/IP Net, OSI App] really is a
pure OSI system isolated in a TCP/IP internet).


7.3.1.  A Transport Relay

Transport relaying can be used when two end systems are run-
ning  common  applications and the lower layer protocols (up
to and including the transport layer)  are  different.   The
transport  relay  converts  one lower layer stack to another
stack, mapping relevant information between the   protocols.
All  traffic  must explicitly go through a transport service
relay at the boundary where the underlying network  services
differ.   There  are  several  cases  that need this type of
capability. For example, an end system running TCP/IP  lower
layers and OSI applications communicating with an end system
running OSI lower layers (CONS or  CLNS)  and  OSI  applica-
tions.

ADVANTAGES:

o Interoperability between OSI upper layers  over  a  TCP/IP
lower layer network.

o Complete transparency to the OSI upper layers



                                                     Page 16







                    DRAFT FOPG-OSI Spec        July 23, 1990


DISADVANTAGES:

o The end system must modify its transport service.

o Locating the relay is an issue that requires static tables
or a new protocol.

o End-to-end packet encryption incurs a security compromise.
This is because the encryption algorithm must be re-computed
in the relay which requires knowledge of the encryption key.
A  relay  having knowledge of an encryption key is the secu-
rity risk.

o End-to-end guarantee of non-corrupted data is compromised.
A  packet  having  a data error while in the transport relay
will get through without notice since the checksum is recom-
puted using a different checksum algorithm.


7.3.2.  Network Layer Encapsulation

An ISO 8473 packet may be  encapsulated  in  an  IP  packet.
Specifically, the ISO 8473 protocol runs above the IP layer.
Once encapsulated, the ISO 8473 portion is treated  as  data
by  the  IP layer and is indistinguishable from any other IP
packet.  The encapsulated ISO 8473 packet may  be  forwarded
through  any IP router.  When the IP portion is removed (de-
encapsulated),  leaving  the  ISO  8473  packet  intact,  it
appears  to  the  OSI network layer as if it has traversed a
single subnetwork.

This scheme  is  useful  when  an  isolated  CLNS  LAN  must
traverse  a  TCP/IP based internetwork on its way to an CLNS
based destination. This scheme is most efficient  when  only
one   system   (an   IS)   on   the   LAN   is   allowed  to
encapsulate/decapsulate.

ADVANTAGES:

o Interoperability between OSI upper layers  over  a  TCP/IP
lower layer network.

o Complete transparency to the OSI upper layers

o No modification to the end system software, unless the end
system is the encapsulator.


DISADVANTAGES:

o   Deriving   encapsulators'   and   de-encapsulators'   IP
addresses  from  NSAP  addresses requires static tables or a
new protocol.


                                                     Page 17







                    DRAFT FOPG-OSI Spec        July 23, 1990


7.4.  Case 4

Case four can be solved with a transport relay.


7.5.  Case 5

Case five can be solved with a transport relay.


7.6.  More complicated transit situations

In all of the solutions that facilitate interoperability and
coexistence,  there is a question as to what the result will
be when the situation becomes complex.   For  example,  con-
sider  two  end systems where the path between them transits
several networks, some OSI (both X.25 and ISO 8473) and some
TCP/IP.   At  what  point  does the solution break? How many
cases is it reasonable to analyze?

Here are several:

Case 6: [OSI Net, OSI Appl] <-> [TCP/IP TRANSIT] <-> [OSI Net, OSI Appl]

Case 7: [TCP/IP Net, Internet Appl] <-> [OSI TRANSIT] <-> [OSI Net, OSI Appl]

Case 8: [TCP/IP Net, Internet Appl] <-> [OSI TRANSIT] <-> [TCP/IP Net, OSI Appl
]


Case 9: [TCP/IP Net, OSI Appl] <-> [OSI TRANSIT] <-> [TCP/IP TRANSIT] <-->
                                             [OSI Net, OSI Appl]



Case 6 is best handled  by  network  encapsulation.  Case  7
requires an application gateway at the edge of the OSI TRAN-
SIT network. Case 8 requires both an application gateway and
network  encapsulation  (IP  within CLNP). In case 9, if the
[TCP/IP Net, OSI Appl] is really an isolated pure OSI stack,
then  encapsulation across the TCP/IP TRANSIT is all that is
required. If the [TCP/IP Net, OSI Appl] is an RFC 1006 host,
then  both  IP  encapsulation and a transport service bridge
may be required.

These situations can generally be broken down by the follow-
ing  guidelines.  If the application changes, then an appli-
cation gateway is required. When an application  gateway  is
required and the network service is incompatible, it is best
to locate the application gateway at  the  point  where  the
network service changes.

If an application gateway is not required then  the  network
service is the primary consideration. If the network service


                                                     Page 18







                    DRAFT FOPG-OSI Spec        July 23, 1990


is the same at both ends of the connection, then it is  best
to  use  network layer encapsulation. Otherwise, if the net-
work service is different at both ends, a transport relay is
required.


8.  CURRENT STATUS OF OSI IN THE INTERNET


8.1.  NATIONAL BACKBONES

Most of the national backbone networks plan to start provid-
ing  limited  Connectionless  Network Service (CLNS) in late
1990 or early  1991.   Some  of  the  agency  backbones  are
upgrading  DECnet Phase IV to DECnet Phase V, which includes
ISO 8473 end to end service.

There are two issues to resolve before most of the backbones
can  provide  operational ISO 8473: (1) routing domain boun-
dary designation and (2) address registration and dissemina-
tion.   Until  IS-IS  dynamic  intra-domain routing, network
management and directory service is available  commercially,
limited  operational  capabilities  can be expected for some
networks.
