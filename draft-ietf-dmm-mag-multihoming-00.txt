Abstract

   The document [RFC4908] proposes to rely on multiple Care-of Addresses
   (CoAs) capabilities of Mobile IP [RFC6275] an Network Mobility (NEMO;
   [RFC3963]) to enable Multihoming technology for Small-Scale Fixed
   Networks.  In the continuation of [RFC4908], this document specifies
   a multiple proxy Care-of Addresses (pCoAs) extension for Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 [RFC5213].  This extension allows a multihomed Mobile Access
   Gateway (MAG) to register more than one proxy care-of-address to the
   Local Mobility Anchor (LMA).

Internet-Draft        MAG Multipath Binding Option         December 2015


1.  Introduction

   Using several links, the multihoming technology can improve
   connectivity availability and quality of communications; the goals
   and benefits of multihoming are as follows:

   o  Redundancy/Fault-Recovery

   o  Load balancing

   o  Load sharing

   o  Preferences settings

   According to [RFC4908], users of Small-Scale Networks can take
   benefit of multihoming using mobile IP [RFC6275] and Network Mobility
   (NEMO) [RFC3963] architecture in a mobile and fixed networking
   environment.  This document was introducing the concept of multiple
   Care-of Addresses (CoAs) [RFC5648] that have been specified since
   then.

   In the continuation of [RFC4908], a Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] based
   multihomed achitecture could be defined.  The motivation to update
   [RFC4908] with proxy Mobile IPv6 is to leverage on latest mobility
   working group achievments, namely:

   o  using GRE as mobile tuneling, possibly with its key extension
      [RFC5845] (a possible reason to use GRE is given on Section 3.2).

   o  using UDP encapsulation [RFC5844] in order to support NAT
      traversal in IPv4 networking environment.

   o  Prefix Delegation mechanism [RFC7148].

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) relies on two mobility entities: the
   mobile access gateway (MAG), which acts as the default gateway for
   the end-node and the local mobility anchor (LMA), which acts as the
   topological anchor point.  Point-to-point links are established,
   using IP-in-IP tunnels, between MAG and LMA.  Then, the MAG and LMA
   are distributing traffic over these tunnels.  All PMIPv6 operations
   are performed on behalf of the end-node and its corespondent node, it
   thus makes PMIPv6 well adapted to multihomed architecture as
   considered in [RFC4908].  Taking the LTE and WLAN networking
   environments as an example, the PMIPv6 based multihomed architecture
   is depicted on Figure 1.  Flow-1,2 and 3 are distributed either on
   Tunnel-1 (over LTE) or Tunnel-2 (over WLAN), while Flow-4 is spread
   on both Tunnel-1 and 2.

             Figure 1: Multihomed MAG using Proxy Mobile IPv6

   Current version of Proxy Mobile IPv6 does not allow a MAG to register
   more than one proxy Care-of-Adresse to the LMA.  In other words, only
   one MAG/LMA link, i.e.  IP-in-IP tunnel, tunnel can be used at the
   same time.  This document overcome this limitation by defining the
   multiple proxy Care-of Addresses (pCoAs) extension for Proxy Mobile
   IPv6.

   Figure 2 is the callflow detailing multi-access support with PMIPv6.
   The MAG in this example scenario is equipped with both WLAN and LTE
   interfaces and is also configured with the MAG functionality.  A
   logical-NAI with ALWAYS-ON configuration is enabled on the MAG.  The
   mobility session that is created on the LMA is for the logical-NAI.
   The IP hosts MN_1 and MN_2 are assigned IP addresses from the
   delegated mobile network prefix.

3.2.  Traffic distribution schemes

   IP mobility protocols allow to establish the forwarding plane over
   the WAN interfaces of a multihomed MAG.  Then, traffic distribution
   schemes define the way to distribute data packets over these paths
   (i.e.  IP tunnels).  Traffic distribution can be managed either on a
   per-flow or on a per-packet basis:

   o  per-flow traffic management: each IP flow (both upstream and
      downstream) is mapped to a given mobile IP tunnel, corresponding
      to a given WAN interface.  This scenario is based on IP flow
      mobility mechanism using the Flow binding extension [RFC6089].
      The mobility anchor provides IP session continuity when an IP flow
      is moved from one WAN interfaces to another.  The flow binding
      extension allows the IP mobility anchor and the MAG to exchange,
      and synchronize, IP flow management policies (i.e. policy routing
      rules associating traffic selectors [RFC6088] to mobility
      bindings).

   o  Per-packet management: distribute the IP packets of a same IP
      flow, or of a group of IP flows, over more than one WAN interface.
      In this scenario, traffic management slightly differs from the
      default mobile IP behaviour; the mobility entities (mobility
      anchor and client) distribute packets, belonging to a same IP
      flow, over more than one bindings simultaneously.  The definition
      of control algorithm of a Per-packet distribution scheme (how to
      distribute packets) is out the scope of this document.  When
      operating at the packet level, traffic distribution scheme may
      introduce packet latency and out-of-order delivery.  It may
      require the mobility entities (MAG and mobility anchor) to be able
      to reorder (ans thus, to buffer) received packets before
      delivering.  A possible implementation is to use GRE as mobile
      tunnelling mechanism, together with the GRE KEY option [RFC5845]
      to add sequence number to GRE packets, and so, to allow the
      receiver to perform reordering.  However, more detailed buffering
      and reordering considerations are out of the scope of this
      document.

   The traffic distribution scheme may require the MAG and the to
   exchange interface metrics to make traffic steering decision.For
   example, the MAG may send it link bandwidth to the mobility anchor,
   so that the latter can make traffic forwarding decision accordingly.
   In this case, the vendor specific mobility option [RFC5094] can be
   used for that purpose.

   Per-flow and per-packet distribution schemes are not exclusive
   mechanisms; they can cohabit in the same multi-access system.  For
   example, High throughput services (e.g. video streaming) may benefit

   from per-packet distribution scheme, while some other may not.
   Typically VoIP application are sensitive to latency and thus should
   not be split over different WAN paths.  In this situation, the
   mobility entities (MAG and mobility anchor) must exchange traffic
   management policies to associate distribution scheme, traffic and WAN
   interface (physical or virtual).  [RFC6088] and [RFC6089] define
   traffic management on a flow basis but there is no such policy on a
   per packet basis.


4.  Protocol Extensions

4.1.  MAG Multipath-Binding Option

   The MAG Multipath-Binding option is a new mobility header option
   defined for use with Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement messages exchanged between the local mobility anchor
   and the mobile access gateway.

   This mobility header option is used for requesting multipath support.
   It indicates that the mobile access gateway is requesting the local
   mobility anchor to register the current care-of address associated
   with the request as one of the many care-addresses through which the
   mobile access gateway can be reached.  It is also for carrying the
   information related to the access network associated with the care-of
   address.

   The MAG Multipath-Binding option has an alignment requirement of
   8n+2.  Its format is as shown in Figure 3:

   0                   1                   2                   3

   This 8-bit field identifies the Access-Technology type of the
   interface through which the mobile node is connected.  The permitted
   values for this are from the Access Technology Type registry defined
   in [RFC5213].

   This 8-bit field represents the interface label represented as an
   unsigned integer.  The mobile node identifies the label for each of
   the interfaces through which it registers a CoA with the home agent.
   When using static traffic flow policies on the mobile node and the
   home agent, the label can be used for generating forwarding policies.
   For example, the operator may have policy which binds traffic for
   Application "X" needs to interface with Label "Y".  When a
   registration through an interface matching Label "Y" gets activated,
   the home agent and the mobile node can dynamically generate a
   forwarding policy for forwarding traffic for Application "X" through
   mobile IP tunnel matching Label "Y".  Both the home agent and the
   mobile node can route the Application-X traffic through that
   interface.  The permitted values for If-Label are 1 through 255.

   This 8-bit field is used for carrying the binding identifier.  It
   uniquely identifies a specific binding of the mobile node, to which
   this request can be associated.  Each binding identifier is
   represented as an unsigned integer.  The permitted values are 1
   through 254.  The BID value of 0 and 255 are reserved.  The mobile
   access gateway assigns a unique value for each of its interfaces and
   includes them in the message.

   This flag, if set to a value of (1), is to notify the local mobility
   anchor to consider this request as a request to update the binding
   lifetime of all the mobile node's bindings, upon accepting this
   specific request.  This flag MUST NOT be set to a value of (1), if
   the value of the Registration Overwrite Flag (O) flag is set to a
   value of (1).

   This flag, if set to a value of (1), notifies the local mobility
   anchor that upon accepting this request, it should replace all of the
   mobile node's existing bindings with this binding.  This flag MUST
   NOT be set to a value of (1), if the value of the Bulk Re-
   registration Flag (B) is set to a value of (1).  This flag MUST be
   set to a value of (0), in de-registration requests.

   Reserved

      This field is unused in this specification.  The value MUST be set
      to zero (0) by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

4.2.  MAG Identifier Option

   The MAG Identifier option is a new mobility header option defined for
   use with Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
   messages exchanged between the local mobility anchor and the mobile
   access gateway.  This mobility header option is used for conveying
   the MAG's identity.

   This option does not have any alignment requirements.

      <IANA-2> To be assigned by IANA.

   Length

      8-bit unsigned integer indicating the length of the option in
      octets, excluding the type and length fields.

   Subtype

      One byte unsigned integer used for identifying the type of the
      Identifier field.  Accepted values for this field are the
      registered type values from the Mobile Node Identifier Option
      Subtypes registry.

   Reserved

      This field is unused in this specification.  The value MUST be set
      to zero (0) by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Identifier

      A variable length identifier of type indicated in the Subtype
      field.

Internet-Draft        MAG Multipath Binding Option         December 2015


4.3.  New Status Code for Proxy Binding Acknowledgement

   This document defines the following new Status Code value for use in
   Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message.

   CANNOT_SUPPORT_MULTIPATH_BINDING (Cannot Support Multipath Binding):
   <IANA-4>


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following IANA actions.

   o  Action-1: This specification defines a new mobility option, the
      MAG Multipath-Binding option.  The format of this option is
      described in Section 4.1.  The type value <IANA-1> for this
      mobility option needs to be allocated from the Mobility Options
      registry at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/mobility-parameters>.
      RFC Editor: Please replace <IANA-1> in Section 4.1 with the
      assigned value and update this section accordingly.

   o  Action-2: This specification defines a new mobility option, the
      MAG Identifier option.  The format of this option is described in
      Section 4.2.  The type value <IANA-2> for this mobility option
      needs to be allocated from the Mobility Options registry at
      <http://www.iana.org/assignments/mobility-parameters>.  RFC
      Editor: Please replace <IANA-2> in Section 4.2 with the assigned
      value and update this section accordingly.

   o  Action-4: This document defines a new status value,
      CANNOT_SUPPORT_MULTIPATH_BINDING (<IANA-4>) for use in Proxy
      Binding Acknowledgement message, as described in Section 4.3.
      This value is to be assigned from the "Status Codes" registry at
      <http://www.iana.org/assignments/mobility-parameters>.  The
      allocated value has to be greater than 127.  RFC Editor: Please
      replace <IANA-4> in Section 4.3 with the assigned value and update
      this section accordingly.


6.  Security Considerations

   This specification allows a mobile access gateway to establish
   multiple Proxy Mobile IPv6 tunnels with a local mobility anchor, by
   registering a care-of address for each of its connected access
   networks.  This essentially allows the mobile node's IP traffic to be
   routed through any of the tunnel paths and either based on a static
   or a dynamically negotiated flow policy.  This new capability has no
   impact on the protocol security.  Furthermore, this specification

Internet-Draft        MAG Multipath Binding Option         December 2015


   defines two new mobility header options, MAG Multipath-Binding option
   and the MAG Identifier option.  These options are carried like any
   other mobility header option as specified in [RFC5213].  Therefore,
   it inherits security guidelines from [RFC5213].  Thus, this
   specification does not weaken the security of Proxy Mobile IPv6
   Protocol, and does not introduce any new security vulnerabilities.
