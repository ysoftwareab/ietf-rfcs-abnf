                         IETF: End Work on IPv4
                       draft-howard-ipv6-ietf-00

Abstract

   The IETF will stop working on IPv4, except where needed to mitigate
   documented security issues, to facilitate the transition to IPv6, or
   to enable IPv4 decommissioning.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute

1.  Statement

   The IETF has developed IPv6 to replace IPv4.

   Ongoing focus is required to ensure that future IETF work is capable
   of IPv6-only operation.  Until the time when IPv4 is no longer in
   wide use and/or declared historic, the IETF needs to continue to
   update IPv4-only protocols and features for vital operational or
   security issues.  Similarly, the IETF needs to complete the work
   related to IPv4-to-IPv6 transition tools for migrating more traffic
   to IPv6.  Some changes may be necessary in IPv4 protocols to
   facilitate decommissioning IPv4 in a way that does not create
   unacceptable impact to applications or users.  These sorts of
   IPv4-focused activities, in support of security, transition, and
   decommissioning, will continue, where accompanied by problem
   statements based on operational experience.

      The IESG will review proposed working group charters to ensure
      that work will be capable of operating without IPv4, except in
      cases of IPv4 security, transition, and decommissioning work.

      The IETF will update IPv4 protocols and features to facilitate
      IPv4 decommissioning.

      New IETF work will explicitly support IPv6, or be IP version
      agnostic (because it is implemented above the network layer),
      except IPv4-specific transition technologies.

      The IETF will not initiate new IPv4 extension technology
      development.

      New IETF work must function completely on IPv6-only nodes and
      networks.

2.  Security Considerations

   It is possible that bugs inherent to IPv4 will yet be discovered.
   The IETF will document these, and may mitigate them if consensus
   exists that mitigation is required.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not direct IANA to alter its processes for
   allocating IPv4 addresses according to its processes.  This is
   unlikely to be a significant activity for long.

4.  Acknowledgements

   This document is based largely on draft-george-ipv6-support, and I
   thank Wes George for his significant work on that document.  Terry
   Manderson was also essential in developing this document.
