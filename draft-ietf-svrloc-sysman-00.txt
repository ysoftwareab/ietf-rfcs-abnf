Abstract

   This document presents definitions for the ''sysman'' (systems
   management) abstract service, and the ''dmi'' (desktop management
   interface), ''cim'' (common information model), and ''snmp'' (simple
   network management protocol), and ''host'' concrete service types.
   These definitions are suitable for use with the Service Location
   Protocol [1].

   Systems management, as used in this document, relates to the
   monitoring, diagnosing, service and support of desktop and
   host computers.
   

1. Introduction

   Service templates and abstract service types are defined in [2]. The
   systems management abstract service type is designed to organize
   information from various services, protocols, and schemas that
   relate to systems management.

        The 'service:sysman' abstract service type organizes information
        from various services, protocols, and schemas that relate to
        systems management. Systems management, as used in this
        document, relates to the monitoring, diagnosing, service and
        support of desktop and host computers.

3. The Host Service Type

   The "host" concrete service type provides information
   immediately relevant to the management of a desktop or host
   computer, such as computer's the operating system version and
   vendor, its physical location, and so on.

   The service:sysman:host service template is as follows:

---------------------------template begins here-----------------------
   type = host

   version = 0.0

   language = en

   description =
    The "host" concrete service type provides information

    computer.

   # system running on the computer. Although there is no list of
   # allowed values, the following values are recommended for their
   # operating systems:
   # 
   # (solaris, netware, windows-nt, windows-95, windows, 
   # linux, dos, macos, aix, irix, hpux, bsdi, freebsd)

   security considerations=
     Free access to computer owner information may present a security
     risk in some environments. The other information provided by this
     service type is generally available in most environments.

4. The DMI Service Type
   
   The "dmi" service type provides information about the computer's
   support of the Desktop Management Interface (DMI), an
   instrumentation standard supported by the Desktop Management Task
   Force (DMTF) [3].

   security considerations=
     The Desktop Management Interface does not yet have a standard
     security scheme. Some attributes may not be secured. Information
     about remote access points to the DMI service provider may
     present a security risk if the RPC mechanism is not adminstered
     properly.

5. The CIM Service Type
   
   The "cim" service type provides information about the computer's
   support of the Common Information Model (CIM)[4]. CIM is a schema
   description languate, meta-schema, and core schema published by the
   Desktop Management Task Force [4].

   The service:sysman:cim service template is as follows:

   security considerations=
     CIM security is derived from the CIMOM and the attributes defined
     in the CIM schema being accessed. Adminstrators should take care to 
     understand the security attributes of the CIM schemas and the 
     characteristics o their CIMOM before publishing information about
     remote access to CIM data. 

  ---------------------------template ends here-------------------------

6. The SNMP Service Type
   
   The "snmp" service type provides information about the Simple Network
   Management Protocol services that are supported by the computer. 
   
   The concrete snmp service template used by the "sysman" abstract type
   is defined in section A.3 of [2]. 

7. Other Security Considerations

   In addition to specific security considerations list above, each of
   these service types inherit the security considerations of the
   "service:" URL scheme as specified in [2]. 

8. Core Rules
   This document uses the following core rules in its grammar 
   definitions:

   alpha-num    = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "."
   safe-char    =  as defined in [2]
   DIGIT        =  as defined in [8]
   ALPHA        =  as defined in [8]
   HEXDIG       =  as defined in [8]
   CHAR         =  as defined in [8]

9. Vendor Strings
   
   In order to allow programmatic searching on the vendor attribute, 
   there must be a convention for representing vendor strings. 
   
   To illustrate the problem, imagine a vendor attribute is registered
   as follows:

   "vendor=Acme Widgets, Limited"



Day                              Expires 30 June 1998           [Page 8]

Internet Draft      Systems Management Abstract Service     January 1998


   Subsequently, three separate service requests are issued:

   (1) SrvRqst: "vendor=Acme"
   (2) SrvRqst: "vendor=Acme Ltd."
   (3) SrvRqst: "vendor=Acme Widgets, Limited"

   Only the third request above will succeed. 

   One solution to this problem is to have a list of allowable values
   for vendor names. However, this is unrealistic because it limits
   vendors to a predefined small set. 

   The better solution is to use a simple convention for representing
   vendor names:
   
   Vendor names SHOULD be represented by using the proper or 
   trademarked name of the vendor with no embellishments.

   For example:

   Sun Microsystems, Wind River Systems, 
   International Business Machines, Amazon.com,
   Digital Equipment Corporation, Hewlett-Packard
   

   The convention is to omit qualifiers such as "Inc.," "Ltd.,"
   and so on, unless those qualifiers are part of the vendors
   trademarked or proper name. While this convention is not 
   foolproof, it should allow programmatic matching of vendors
   in almost all cases.
