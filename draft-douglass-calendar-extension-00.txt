Internet-Draft  Event Publishing Extensions to Icalendar   February 2011


1.  Introduction

   The currently existing iCalendar standard [RFC5545] lacks useful
   methods for referencing additional, external information relating to
   calendar components.

   This document defines a number of properties referencing external
   information that can provide additional information about an
   iCalendar component.  The intent is that such information can be
   automatically discovered and used by clients.  Formats such as VCARD
   are likely to be most useful.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


2.  Typed References

   The properties defined here can all reference external meta-data
   which may be used by applications to provide enhanced value to users.
   By providing type information as parameters, clients and servers are
   able to discover interesting references and make use of them, perhaps
   for indexing or the presentation of additional related information
   for the user.

   These properties are designed to handle common use cases in event
   publication.  It is generally important to provide information about
   the organizers of such events.  Sponsors wish to be referenced in a
   prominent manner.  In social calendaring it is often important to
   identify the active participants in the event, for example a school
   sports team, and the inactive participants, for example the parents.

   The [RFC5545] LOCATION property provides only an unstructured single
   text value for specifying the location where an event (or "TODO"
   item) will occur.  This is inadequate for use cases where structured
   location information (e.g. address, region, country, postal code) is
   required or preferred, and limits widespread adoption of iCalendar in
   those settings.

   In addition, using STRUCTURED-LOCATION, information about a number of
   interesting locations can be communicated, for example, parking,
   restaurants and the venue.  Servers and clients can retrieve the
   objects when storing the event and use them to index by geographic
   location.

   The properties defined here are all URI references to some related
   data.  When a calendar client receives a calendar component it can
   search the set of supplied properties looking for those of particular
   interest.  The TYPE and FMTTYPE parameters, if supplied, can be used
   to help the selection.

   Having located such a property, e.g.  STRUCTURED-LOCATION with
   TYPE=PARKING, the client can use http GET on the supplied URL perhaps
   with an ACCEPT header set to specify the desired format.  The
   targeted server SHOULD respond with a 406 if the resource is not
   available in the desired format(s).


3.  Use Cases

   The main motivation for these properties has been event publication
   but there are opportunities for use elsewhere.  The following use
   cases will describe some possible scenarios.

3.1.  Piano Concert Performance

   In putting together a concert there are many participants: piano
   tuner, performer, stage hands etc.  In addition there are sponsors
   and various contacts to be provided.  There will also be a number of
   related locations.  A number of events can be created, all of which
   relate to the performance in different ways.

   There may be an iTip meeting request for the piano tuner who will
   arrive before the performance.  Other members of staff may also
   receive meeting requests.

   An event can also be created for publication which will have a
   PARTICIPANT reference to the pianist providing vcard information
   about the performer.  This event would also hold information about
   parking, local subway stations and the venue itself.  In addition,
   there will be sponsorship information for sponsors of the event and
   perhaps paid sponsorship properties essentially advertising local
   establishments.

3.2.  Itineraries

   These properties also provide opportunities for the travel industry.
   When booking a flight the SPONSOR property can be used to provide
   references to businesses at the airports and to car hire businesses
   at the destination.

   The embedded location information can guide the traveller at the
   airport or to their final destination.  The contact information can

   provide detailed information about the booking agent, the airlines
   and car hire companies and the hotel.


4.  New Property Parameters

4.1.  Type

   Parameter name:  TYPE

   Purpose:  To subtype the associated property.

   Format Definition:

      This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     typeparam      = "TYPE" "=" text

   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on a number of
      properties, and provides a way to differentiate multiple values.
      For example, it allows event producers to provide contact
      information for different purposes.

4.2.  Level

   Parameter name:  LEVEL

   Purpose:  To define a level of sponsorship.

   Format Definition:

      This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     levelparam    = "LEVEL" "=" (1*2DIGIT / "10")
                                   ; An integer between 1 and 10.

   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on the SPONSOR
      property, and provides a way to assign a level of sponsorship with
      1 being the highest level. .

4.3.  Title

   Parameter name:  TITLE

   Purpose:  To provide a human readable title.

   Format Definition:

      This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     titleparam     = "TITLE" "=" text

   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on all properties
      defined in this specification, and provides a human readable
      label, perhaps for icons or links..


5.  New Properties

5.1.  Structured-Contact

   Property name:  STRUCTURED-CONTACT

   Purpose:  This property provides a typed reference to external
      information about a contact or optionally a plain text typed
      value.

   Value type:  The default value type for this property is URI.  The
      value type can also be set to TEXT to indicate plain text content.

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard, title, type or format type
      parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MAY be specified in any iCalendar
      component.

   Description:  When used in a component the value of this property
      points to structured contact information, for example, it may
      reference a VCARD giving detailed information.  A summary of the
      vcard value for the primary contact could be used to populate the
      CONTACT property.
