                      DNS Reverse IP AMT Discovery
              draft-jholland-mboned-driad-amt-discovery-03

Abstract

   This document defines a new DNS resource record (RR) used to
   advertise addresses for Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT) relays
   capable of receiving multicast traffic from the owner of the RR.  The
   new AMTRELAY RR makes possible a source-specific method for AMT
   gateways to discover appropriate AMT relays, in order to ingest
   traffic for source-specific multicast channels into multicast-capable
   receiving networks when no multicast connectivity is directly
   available between the sending and receiving networks.

Internet-Draft                    DRIAD                     January 2019


1.  Introduction

   This document defines DNS Reverse IP AMT Discovery (DRIAD), a
   mechanism for AMT gateways to discover AMT relays which are capable
   of forwarding multicast traffic from a known source IP address.

   AMT (Automatic Multicast Tunneling) is defined in [RFC7450], and
   provides a method to transport multicast traffic over a unicast
   tunnel, in order to traverse non-multicast-capable network segments.

   Section 4.1.5 of [RFC7450] explains that relay selection might need
   to depend on the source of the multicast traffic, since a relay must
   be able to receive multicast traffic from the desired source in order
   to forward it.

   That section suggests DNS-based queries as a possible solution.
   DRIAD is a DNS-based solution, as suggested there.  This solution
   also addresses the relay discovery issues in the "Disadvantages"
   lists in Section 3.3 of [RFC8313] and Section 3.4 of [RFC8313].

   The goal for DRIAD is to enable multicast connectivity between
   separate multicast-enabled networks when neither the sending nor the
   receiving network is connected to a multicast-enabled backbone,
   without pre-configuring any peering arrangement between the networks.

1.1.  Background

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the basic DNS concepts
   described in [RFC1034], [RFC1035], and the subsequent documents that
   update them, particularly [RFC2181].

   The reader is also assumed to be familiar with the concepts and
   terminology regarding source-specific multicast as described in
   [RFC4607] and the use of IGMPv3 [RFC3376] and MLDv2 [RFC3810] for
   group management of source-specific multicast channels, as described
   in [RFC4604].

   The reader should also be familiar with AMT, particularly the
   terminology listed in Section 3.2 of [RFC7450] and Section 3.3 of
   [RFC7450].

1.2.  Terminology

1.2.1.  Relays and Gateways

   When reading this document, it's especially helpful to recall that
   once an AMT tunnel is established, the relay receives native
   multicast traffic and sends unicast tunnel-encapsulated traffic to

   the gateway, and the gateway receives the tunnel-encapsulated
   packets, decapsulates them, and forwards them as native multicast
   packets, as illustrated in Figure 1.

2.  Relay Discovery Operation

2.1.  Overview

   The AMTRELAY resource record (RR) defined in this document is used to
   publish the IP address or domain name of an AMT relay that can
   receive, encapsulate, and forward multicast traffic from a particular
   sender.

   The sender is the owner of the RR, and configures the RR so that it
   contains the address or domain name of an AMT relay that can receive
   multicast IP traffic from that sender.

   This enables AMT gateways in remote networks to discover an AMT relay
   that is capable of forwarding traffic from the sender.  This in turn
   enables those AMT gateways to receive the multicast traffic tunneled
   over a unicast AMT tunnel from those relays, and then to pass the
   multicast packets into networks or applications that are using the
   gateway to subscribe to traffic from that sender.

   This mechanism only works for source-specific multicast (SSM)
   channels.  The source address of the (S,G) is reversed and used as an
   index into one of the reverse mapping trees (in-addr.arpa for IPv4,
   as described in Section 3.5 of [RFC1035], or ip6.arpa for IPv6, as
   described in Section 2.5 of [RFC3596]).

   Some detailed example use cases are provided in Section 3, and other
   applicable example topologies appear in Section 3.3 of [RFC8313],
   Section 3.4 of [RFC8313], and Section 3.5 of [RFC8313].

2.2.  Signaling and Discovery

   This section describes a typical example of the end-to-end process
   for signaling a receiver's join of a SSM channel that relies on an
   AMTRELAY RR.

   The example in Figure 2 contains 2 multicast-enabled networks that
   are both connected to the internet with non-multicast-capable links,
   and which have no direct association with each other.

   A content provider operates a sender, which is a source of multicast
   traffic inside a multicast-capable network.

   An end user who is a customer of the content provider has a
   multicast-capable internet service provider, which operates a
   receiving network that uses an AMT gateway.  The AMT gateway is
   DRIAD-capable.

   The content provider provides the user with a receiving application
   that tries to subscribe to at least one (S,G).  This receiving
   application could for example be a file transfer system using FLUTE
   [RFC6726] or a live video stream using RTP [RFC3550], or any other
   application that might subscribe to a SSM channel.

   contains the domain name "15.100.51.198.in-addr.arpa.", which is the
   reverse lookup domain name for his sender.  The zone file contains an

   AMTRELAY RR with the Relay's IP address.  (See Section 4.3 for
   details about the AMTRELAY RR format and semantics.)

   The sequence of events depicted in Figure 2 is as follows:

   1.  The end user starts the app, which issues a join to the (S,G):
       (198.51.100.15, 232.252.0.2).

   2.  The join propagates with RPF through the multicast-enabled
       network with PIM [RFC7761] or another multicast routing
       mechanism, until the AMT gateway receives a signal to join the
       (S,G).

   3.  The AMT gateway performs a reverse DNS lookup for the AMTRELAY
       RRType, by sending an AMTRELAY RRType query for the FQDN
       "15.100.51.198.in-addr.arpa.", using the reverse IP domain name
       for the sender's source IP address (the S from the (S,G)), as
       described in Section 3.5 of [RFC1035].

       The DNS resolver for the AMT gateway uses ordinary DNS recursive
       resolution until it has the authoritative result that the content
       provider configured, which informs the AMT gateway that the relay
       address is 203.0.113.15.

   4.  The AMT gateway performs AMT handshakes with the AMT relay as
       described in Section 4 of [RFC7450], then forwards a Membership
       report to the relay indicating subscription to the (S,G).

   5.  The relay propagates the join through its network toward the
       sender, then forwards the appropriate AMT-encapsulated traffic to
       the gateway, which decapsulates and forwards it as native
       multicast through its downstream network to the end user.

2.3.  Optimal Relay Selection

   The reverse source IP DNS query of an AMTRELAY RR is a good way for a
   gateway to discover a relay that is known to the sender.

   However, it is NOT necessarily a good way to discover the best relay
   for that gateway to use, because the RR IP will only provide
   information about relays known to the source.

   If there is an upstream relay in a network that is more local to the
   gateway and able to receive and forward multicast traffic from the
   sender, that relay is better for the gateway to use, since more of
   the network path uses native multicast, allowing more chances for
   packet replication.  But since that relay is not known to the sender,

   it won't be advertised in the sender's reverse IP DNS record.  An
   example network with this scenario is outlined in Section 3.1.2.

   It's only appropriate for an AMT gateway to discover an AMT relay by
   querying an AMTRELAY RR owned by a sender when all of these
   conditions are met:

   1.  The gateway needs to propagate a join of an (S,G) over AMT,
       because in the gateway's network, no RPF next hop toward the
       source can propagate a native multicast join of the (S,G); and

   2.  The gateway is not already connected to a relay that forwards
       multicast traffic from the source of the (S,G); and

   3.  The gateway is not configured to use a particular IP address for
       AMT discovery, or a relay discovered with that IP is not able to
       forward traffic from the source of the (S,G); and

   4.  The gateway is not able to find an upstream AMT relay with DNS-SD
       [RFC6763], using "_amt._udp" as the Service section of the
       queries, or a relay discovered this way is not able to forward
       traffic from the source of the (S,G)

   When the above conditions are met, the gateway has no path within its
   local network that can receive multicast traffic from the source IP
   of the (S,G).

   In this situation, the best way to find a relay that can forward the
   required traffic is to use information that comes from the operator
   of the sender.  When the sender has configured the AMTRELAY RR
   defined in this document, gateways can use the DRIAD mechanism
   defined in this document to discover the relay information provided
   by the sender.

2.4.  DNS Configuration

   Often an AMT gateway will only have access to the source and group IP
   addresses of the desired traffic, and will not know any other name
   for the source of the traffic.  Because of this, typically the best
   way of looking up AMTRELAY RRs will be by using the source IP address
   as an index into one of the reverse mapping trees (in-addr.arpa for
   IPv4, as described in Section 3.5 of [RFC1035], or ip6.arpa for IPv6,
   as described in Section 2.5 of [RFC3596]).

   Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that AMTRELAY RRs be added to reverse IP
   zones as appropriate.  AMTRELAY records MAY also appear in other
   zones, but the primary intended use case requires a reverse IP

   mapping for the source from an (S,G) in order to be useful to most
   AMT gateways.

   <TBD>

   Please can a DNS expert review the following paragraph and perhaps
   help construct an equivalent and more clear explanation?

   I borrowed the language from https://tools.ietf.org/html/
   rfc4025#section-1.2, but I'm not actually sure what "the fashion
   usual for PTR records" means, precisely...

   PTR gives a domain name, and then we do what, an A/AAAA record
   lookup, and then a AMTRELAY lookup on the final name that has a valid
   A/AAAA after any CNAME/DNAME chain? - jake 2019-01-13

   </TBD>

   When the reverse IP mapping has no AMTRELAY RR but does have a PTR
   record, the lookup is done in the fashion usual for PTR records.  The
   IP address' octets (IPv4) or nibbles (IPv6) are reversed and looked
   up with the appropriate suffix.  Any CNAMEs or DNAMEs found MUST be
   followed, and finally the AMTRELAY RR is queried with the resulting
   domain name.

   See Section 4 and Section 4.3 for a detailed explanation of the
   contents for a DNS Zone file.

3.1.  Example Receiving Networks

3.1.1.  Tier 3 ISP

   One example of a receiving network is an ISP that offers multicast
   ingest services to its subscribers, illustrated in Figure 3.

   In the example network below, subscribers can join (S,G)s with MLDv2
   or IGMPv3 as described in [RFC4604], and the AMT gateway in this ISP
   can receive and forward multicast traffic from one of the example
   sending networks in Section 3.2 by discovering the appropriate AMT
   relays with a DNS lookup for the AMTRELAY RR with the reverse IP of
   the source in the (S,G).

3.1.2.  Small Office

   Another example receiving network is a small branch office that
   regularly accesses some multicast content, illustrated in Figure 4.

   This office has desktop devices that need to receive some multicast
   traffic, so an AMT gateway runs on a LAN with these devices, to pull
   traffic in through a non-multicast next-hop.

   The office also hosts some mobile devices that have AMT gateway
   instances embedded inside apps, in order to receive multicast traffic
   over their non-multicast wireless LAN.  (Note that the "Legacy
   Router" is a simplification that's meant to describe a variety of
   possible conditions- for example it could be a device providing a
   split-tunnel VPN as described in [RFC7359], deliberately excluding

                      Figure 5: Small Office Example

   When multicast-capable networks are chained like this, with a network
   like the one in Figure 5 receiving internet services from a
   multicast-capable network like the one in Figure 3, it's important
   for AMT gateways to reach the more local AMT relay, in order to avoid
   accidentally tunneling multicast traffic from a more distant AMT
   relay with unicast, and failing to utilize the multicast transport
   capabilities of the network in Figure 3.

   For this reason, it's RECOMMENDED that AMT gateways by default
   perform service discovery using DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD)
   [RFC6763] for _amt._udp.<domain> (with <domain> chosen as described
   in Section 11 of [RFC6763]) and use the AMT relays discovered that
   way in preference to AMT relays discoverable via the mechanism
   defined in this document (DRIAD).

   It's also RECOMMENDED that when the well-known anycast IP addresses
   defined in Section 7 of [RFC7450] are suitable for discovering an AMT
   relay that can forward traffic from the source, that a DNS record
   with the AMTRELAY RRType be published for those IP addresses along
   with any other appropriate AMTRELAY RRs to indicate the best relative
   precedences for receiving the source traffic.

Internet-Draft                    DRIAD                     January 2019


   Accordingly, AMT gateways SHOULD by default discover the most-
   preferred relay first by DNS-SD, then by DRIAD as described in this
   document (in precedence order, as described in Section 4.2.1), then
   with the anycast addresses defined in Section 7 of [RFC7450] (namely:
   192.52.193.1 and 2001:3::1) if those IPs weren't listed in the
   AMTRELAY RRs.  This default behavior MAY be overridden by
   administrative configuration where other behavior is more appropriate
   for the gateway within its network.

   The discovery and connection process for multiple relays MAY operate
   in parallel, but when forwarding multicast group membership reports
   with new joins from an AMT gateway, membership reports SHOULD be
   forwarded to the most-preferred relays first, falling back to less
   preferred relays only after failing to receive traffic for an
   appropriate timeout, and only after reporting a leave to any more-
   preferred connected relays that have failed to subscribe to the
   traffic.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the default timeout be no less than 3 seconds,
   but the value MAY be overridden by administrative configuration,
   where known groups or channels need a different timeout for
   successful application performance.

3.2.  Example Sending Networks

3.2.1.  Sender-controlled Relays

   When a sender network is also operating AMT relays to distribute
   multicast traffic, as in Figure 6, each address could appear as an
   AMTRELAY RR for the reverse IP of the sender, or one or more domain
   names could appear in AMTRELAY RRs, and the AMT relay addresses can
   be discovered by finding an A or AAAA record from those domain names.

3.2.2.  Provider-controlled Relays

   When an ISP offers a service to transmit outbound multicast traffic
   through a forwarding network, it might also offer AMT relays in order
   to reach receivers without multicast connectivity to the forwarding
   network, as in Figure 7.  In this case it's RECOMMENDED that the ISP
   also provide a domain name for the AMT relays for use with the
   discovery process defined in this document.

   When the sender wishes to use the relays provided by the ISP for
   forwarding multicast traffic, an AMTRELAY RR should be configured to
   use the domain name provided by the ISP, to allow for address
   reassignment of the relays without forcing the sender to reconfigure
   the corresponding AMTRELAY RRs.

4.2.1.  RData Format - Precedence

   This is an 8-bit precedence for this record.  It is interpreted in
   the same way as the PREFERENCE field described in Section 3.3.9 of
   [RFC1035].

   Relays listed in AMTRELAY records with a lower value for precedence
   are to be attempted first.

   Where there is a tie in precedence, the default choice of relay MUST
   be non-deterministic, to support load balancing.  The AMT gateway
   operator MAY override this default choice with explicit configuration
   when it's necessary for administrative purposes.

   For example, one network might prefer to tunnel IPv6 multicast
   traffic over IPv6 AMT and IPv4 multicast traffic over IPv4 AMT to
   avoid routeability problems in IPv6 from affecting IPv4 traffic and
   vice versa, while another network might prefer to tunnel both kinds
   of traffic over IPv6 to reduce the IPv4 space used by its AMT
   gateways.  In this example scenario or other cases where there is an
   administrative preference that requires explicit configuration, a
   receiving network MAY make systematically different precedence
   choices among records with the same precedence value.

4.2.2.  RData Format - Discovery Optional (D-bit)

   The D bit is a "Discovery Optional" flag.

   If the D bit is set to 0, a gateway using this RR MUST perform AMT
   relay discovery as described in Section 4.2.1.1 of [RFC7450], rather
   than directly sending an AMT request message to the relay.

   That is, the gateway MUST receive an AMT relay advertisement message
   (Section 5.1.2 of [RFC7450]) for an address before sending an AMT
   request message (Section 5.1.3 of [RFC7450]) to that address.  Before
   receiving the relay advertisement message, this record has only
   indicated that the address can be used for AMT relay discovery, not
   for a request message.  This is necessary for devices that are not
   fully functional AMT relays, but rather load balancers or brokers, as
   mentioned in Section 4.2.1.1 of [RFC7450].

   If the D bit is set to 1, the gateway MAY send an AMT request message
   directly to the discovered relay address without first sending an AMT
   discovery message.

   This bit should be set according to advice from the AMT relay
   operator.  The D bit MUST be set to zero when no information is
   available from the AMT relay operator about its suitability.

4.2.3.  RData Format - Type

   The type field indicates the format of the information that is stored
   in the relay field.

   The following values are defined:

   o  type = 0: The relay field is empty (0 bytes).

   o  type = 1: The relay field contains a 4-octet IPv4 address.

   o  type = 2: The relay field contains a 16-octet IPv6 address.

   o  type = 3: The relay field contains a wire-encoded domain name.
      The wire-encoded format is self-describing, so the length is
      implicit.  The domain name MUST NOT be compressed.  (See
      Section 3.3 of [RFC1035] and Section 4 of [RFC3597].)

4.2.4.  RData Format - Relay

   The relay field is the address or domain name of the AMT relay.  It
   is formatted according to the type field.

   When the type field is 0, the length of the relay field is 0, and it
   indicates that no AMT relay should be used for multicast traffic from
   this source.

   When the type field is 1, the length of the relay field is 4 octets,
   and a 32-bit IPv4 address is present.  This is an IPv4 address as
   described in Section 3.4.1 of [RFC1035].  This is a 32-bit number in
   network byte order.

   When the type field is 2, the length of the relay field is 16 octets,
   and a 128-bit IPv6 address is present.  This is an IPv6 address as
   described in Section 2.2 of [RFC3596].  This is a 128-bit number in
   network byte order.

   When the type field is 3, the relay field is a normal wire-encoded
   domain name, as described in Section 3.3 of [RFC1035].  Compression
   MUST NOT be used, for the reasons given in Section 4 of [RFC3597].

4.3.  AMTRELAY Record Presentation Format

4.3.1.  Representation of AMTRELAY RRs

   AMTRELAY RRs may appear in a zone data master file.  The precedence,
   D-bit, relay type, and relay fields are REQUIRED.

Internet-Draft                    DRIAD                     January 2019


   If the relay type field is 0, the relay field MUST be ".".

   The presentation for the record is as follows:

     IN AMTRELAY precedence D-bit type relay

4.3.2.  Examples

   In a DNS resolver that understands the AMTRELAY type, the zone might
   contain a set of entries like this:

       $ORIGIN 100.51.198.in-addr.arpa.
       10     IN AMTRELAY  10 0 1 203.0.113.15
       10     IN AMTRELAY  10 0 2 2001:DB8::15
       10     IN AMTRELAY 128 1 3 amtrelays.example.com.

   This configuration advertises an IPv4 discovery address, an IPv6
   discovery address, and a domain name for AMT relays which can receive
   traffic from the source 198.51.100.10.  The IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
   are configured with a D-bit of 0 (meaning discovery is mandatory, as
   described in Section 4.2.2), and a precedence 10 (meaning they're
   preferred ahead of the last entry, which has precedence 128).

   For zone files in resolvers that don't support the AMTRELAY RRType
   natively, it's possible to use the format for unknown RR types, as
   described in [RFC3597].  This approach would replace the AMTRELAY
   entries in the example above with the entries below:

   [To be removed (TBD): replace 65280 with the IANA-assigned value
   TBD1, here and in Appendix B. ]

     10   IN TYPE65280  \# (
            6  ; length
            0a ; precedence=10
            01 ; D=0, relay type=1, an IPv4 address
            cb00710f ) ; 203.0.113.15
     10   IN TYPE65280  \# (
            18 ; length
            0a ; precedence=10
            02 ; D=0, relay type=2, an IPv6 address
            20010db800000000000000000000000f ) ; 2001:db8::15
     10   IN TYPE65280  \# (
            24 ; length
            80 ; precedence=128
            83 ; D=1, relay type=3, a wire-encoded domain name
            616d7472656c6179732e6578616d706c652e636f6d2e ) ; domain name

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the IANA Registry for DNS Resource Record Types
   by assigning type TBD1 to the AMTRELAY record.

   This document creates a new registry named "AMTRELAY Resource Record
   Parameters", with a sub-registry for the "Relay Type Field".  The
   initial values in the sub-registry are:

             +-------+---------------------------------------+
             | Value | Description                           |
             +-------+---------------------------------------+
             |   0   | No relay is present.                  |
             |   1   | A 4-byte IPv4 address is present      |
             |   2   | A 16-byte IPv6 address is present     |
             |   3   | A wire-encoded domain name is present |
             | 4-255 | Unassigned                            |
             +-------+---------------------------------------+

   Values 0, 1, 2, and 3 are further explained in Section 4.2.3 and
   Section 4.2.4.  Relay type numbers 4 through 255 can be assigned with
   a policy of Specification Required (as described in [RFC8126]).

6.  Security Considerations

   [ TBD: these 3 are just the first few most obvious issues, with just
   sketches of the problem.  Explain better, and look for trickier
   issues. ]

6.1.  Record-spoofing

   If AMT is used to ingest multicast traffic, providing a false
   AMTRELAY record to a gateway using it for discovery can result in
   Denial of Service, or artificial multicast traffic from a source
   under an attacker's control.

   Therefore, it is important to ensure that the AMTRELAY record is
   authentic, with DNSSEC [RFC4033] or other operational safeguards that
   can provide assurance of the authenticity of the record contents.

6.2.  Local Override

   The local relays, while important for overall network performance,
   can't be secured by DNSSEC.

6.3.  Congestion

   Multicast traffic, particularly interdomain multicast traffic,
   carries some congestion risks, as described in Section 4 of
   [RFC8085].  Network operators are advised to take precautions
   including monitoring of application traffic behavior, traffic
   authentication, and rate-limiting of multicast traffic, in order to
   ensure network health.

Appendix A.  New RRType Request Form

   This is the template for requesting a new RRType recommended in
   Appendix A of [RFC6895].

A. Submission Date:

B.1 Submission Type:
 [x] New RRTYPE  [ ] Modification to RRTYPE
B.2 Kind of RR:
 [x] Data RR     [ ] Meta-RR

C. Contact Information for submitter (will be publicly posted):
 Name:  Jake Holland
 Email Address: jakeholland.net@gmail.com
 International telephone number: +1-626-486-3706
 Other contact handles: jholland@akamai.com

D. Motivation for the new RRTYPE application.
 It provides a bootstrap so AMT (RFC 7450) gateways can discover
 an AMT relay that can receive multicast traffic from a specific source,
 in order to signal multicast group membership and receive multicast
 traffic over a unicast tunnel using AMT.

E. Description of the proposed RR type.
   This description can be provided in-line in the template, as an
   attachment, or with a publicly available URL.
 Please see draft-jholland-mboned-driad-amt-discovery.

F. What existing RRTYPE or RRTYPEs come closest to filling that need
   and why are they unsatisfactory?
 Some similar concepts appear in IPSECKEY, as described in
 Section 1.2 of [RFC4025]. The IPSECKEY RRType is unsatisfactory
 because it refers to IPSec Keys instead of to AMT relays, but
 the motivating considerations for using reverse IP and for
 providing a precedence are similar--an AMT gateway often
 has access to a source address for a multicast (S,G), but does
 not have access to a relay address that can receive multicast
 traffic from the source, without administrative configuration.

 Defining a format for a TXT record could serve the need for AMT
 relay discovery semantics, but Section 5 of [RFC5507] provides a
 compelling argument for requesting a new RRType instead.

G. What mnemonic is requested for the new RRTYPE (optional)?
 AMTRELAY

H. Does the requested RRTYPE make use of any existing IANA registry

   or require the creation of a new IANA subregistry in DNS
   Parameters?
 Yes, IANA is requested to create a subregistry named "AMT Relay
 Type Field" in a "AMTRELAY Resource Record Parameters" registry.
 The field values are defined in Section 4.2.3 and Section 4.2.4,
 and a summary table is given in Section 5.

I. Does the proposal require/expect any changes in DNS
   servers/resolvers that prevent the new type from being processed
   as an unknown RRTYPE (see RFC3597)?
 No.

J. Comments:
 It may be worth noting that the gateway type field from Section 2.3 of
 [RFC4025] and Section 2.5 of [RFC4025] is very similar to the
 Relay Type field in this request.  I tentatively assume that trying to
 re-use that sub-registry is a worse idea than duplicating it, but I'll
 invite others to consider the question and voice an opinion, in case
 there is a different consensus.

Appendix B.  Unknown RRType construction

   In a DNS resolver that understands the AMTRELAY type, the zone file
   might contain this line:

     IN AMTRELAY 128 0 3 amtrelays.example.com.

   In order to translate this example to appear as an unknown RRType as
   defined in [RFC3597], one could run the following program:

   <CODE BEGINS>
     $ cat translate.py
     #!/usr/bin/python3
     import sys
     name=sys.argv[1]
     print(len(name))
     print(''.join('%02x'%ord(x) for x in name))

   22 is the length of the domain name, so to this we add 2 (1 for the
   precedence field and 1 for the combined D-bit and relay type fields)
   to get the full length of the RData.

   This results in a zone file entry like this:

    IN TYPE65280  \# ( 24 ; length
            80 ; precedence = 128
            03 ; D-bit=0, relay type=3 (wire-encoded domain name)
            616d7472656c6179732e6578616d706c652e636f6d2e ) ; domain name
