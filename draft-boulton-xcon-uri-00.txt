1.  Introduction

   A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is defined as a compact string of
   characters for identifying an abstract or physical resource.  This
   document defines a URI scheme and syntax for the conference object
   identifier, as defined in "A Framework and Data Model for Centralized
   Conferencing" [3]

   A Conference Object, defined in [3], provides the data representation
   of a conference instance during its varying life-cycle stages.  A
   conference object is unique within a conferencing system and requires
   a mechanism for identifying and associating varying components/
   interfaces that construct and manipulate a conference instance.  The
   XCON-URI scheme defined in this document provides a unique top-level
   conference object identifier that provides such functionality.  The
   conference object identifier can then be used by the conferencing
   system and related protocols to gain access and reference a specific
   conference object (for example, used by a Conference Control
   Protocol).  It is expected that a Conference Object may be accessed
   by a number of future mechanisms.  It is the intention of this
   document to also provide appropriate guidelines for mapping to future
   extensions.


2.  Conventions and Terminology

   In this document, BCP 14/RFC 2119 [1] defines the key words "MUST",
   "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL".  In
   addition, BCP 15 indicates requirement levels for compliant
   implementations.

   This document uses the terminology defined in [3] and also defines
   the following additional terms:
   TODO  : TODO.


3.  Overview

   The conference object identifier can be viewed as a key to accessing
   a specific conference object.  It is used by the conference control
   protocol as described in (TBD) to access, manipulate and delete a
   conference object.  A conference object identifier is provided to the
   conferencing client to enable such functions to be carried out.  This
   can either be returned through the conference control protocol while
   creating a conference object, be provided by the conference
   notification service or through out-of-band mechanisms (e.g.
   E-Mail).

   Editors Note: Part of the extension to the Conference Package for
   XCON?

   A centralized conferencing (XCON) system, as defined in the
   Conference Framework [3], has potential to expose a range of
   interfaces and protocols.  It is also possible that future additions
   to the centralized conferencing framework might place requirements to
   provide further additional protocols and interfaces.  A conference
   object can consist and be associated with many identifiers that are
   in some way related to a conference object.  Good examples include
   the Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP)[4] and call signaling
   protocols, such as SIP.  Each use unique identifiers to represent a
   protocol instance associated with a conference object.

   A conferencing system may maintain a relationship between the
   conference object identifiers and the identifiers associated with
   each of the complimentary centralized conferencing protocols (e.g.,
   call signaling protocols, BFCP, etc.).  To facilitate the maintenance
   of these relationships, the conference object identifier acts as a
   top level identifier within the conferencing system for the purpose
   of identifying the interfaces for these other protocols.  This
   implicit binding provides a structured mapping of the various
   protocols with the associated conference object Identifier.  Figure 1
   illustrates the relationship between the identifiers used for the
   protocols within this framework and the general conference object
   identifier.

                   Figure 1: Conference Object Mapping.

   In Figure 1, the conference object identifier acts as the top level
   key in the identification process.  The call signaling protocols have
   an associated conference user identifier, often represented in the

   form of URIs.  The binary floor control protocol, as defined in [5],
   defines the 'conf-id' identifier which represents a conference
   instance within floor control.  When created within the conferencing
   system, the 'conf-id' has a 1:1 mapping to the unique conference
   object Identifier.  Operations associated with the conference control
   protocols are directly associated with the conference object, thus
   the primary identifier associated with these protocols is the
   conference object identifier.  The mappings between additional
   protocols/interface is not strictly 1:1 and does allow for multiple
   occurrences.  For example, multiple call signaling protocols will
   each have a representation that is implicitly linked to the top level
   conference object identifier e.g.  H323 and SIP URIs that represent a
   conference instance.  It should be noted that a conferencing system
   is free to structure such relationships as required and this
   information is just included as a guideline that can be used.

   The following example illustrates the representation and
   relationships that might occur in a typical conference instance.  The
   table in Figure 2 lists a typical conference instance and related
   properties.

                 Figure 3: Conference Tree Representation

   Further elements can be added to the tree representation in Figure 3
   to enable a complete representation of a conference instance within a
   conferencing system.

   This style of association can be applied to any supplementary
   mechanisms that are applied to the centralized conferencing model
   defined in this document as long as a unique reference per conference
   instance is available that can be mapped to a conference object.

3.1.  URI Mapping

   As mentioned in the previous section, it is possible to map an 'xcon'
   URI from this specification for multiple usages.  Identification of a
   conference instance within related protocols can be derived from the
   appropriate 'xcon' URI.  It is expected that any future additions to
   centralized conferencing will make use of the mappings provided in
   this section.

Internet-Draft                  XCON URI                    October 2006


   A basic XCON URI looks as follows:-

   xcon:83Hd79qhjsd@example.com

   The left hand side of the URI (to the left of the '@') represents the
   unique token.  This token can be used by any protocol wishing to gain
   access to functionality associated with a specific conference object.
   For example, when used to construct a SIP INVITE request, the token
   would be used to populate the 'user' part of the SIP URI - as defined
   in RFC 3261[2].  The right hand side of the URI, as with any URI,
   provides domain level information ('example.com' in previous
   example).  So continuing the previous example, the SIP URI domain
   part would be equal to this domain information.  This would result in
   the following SIP URI that would enable a request to be sent to the
   conference instance (to join) at a conferencing system:

   sip:83Hd79qhjsd@example.com

   Another example would be the mapping of the previous 'xcon' URI for
   the purpose of BFCP.  Again, the previously described 'left side' of
   the URI would be extracted and used as the 'confid' defined in [5].
   The 'right side' of the URI provides the required connection
   information to construct a BFCP connection.  The hostname can be used
   to provide either a an IP address or use DNS resolution to provide a
   connection location (and optionally port).  A port can be explicitly
   defined if required.

   [Editors Note: Describe mapping for Conference Control - TODO].

   The syntax defined in Section 4 also allows additional URI parameters
   to be defined.  This specification does not define any parameters or
   usages but future documentation MAY require additional functionality.
   All unknown parameters SHOULD be ignored when used for mapping
   purposes but MAY be included if specifically documented.

   [Editors Note: This is currently for discussion.  Strict mapping
   rules will be defined based on discussion].

5.  Conference Object Identifier Distribution

   The actual distribution of conference object identifiers is
   considered out of scope for this document.  It is expected that they
   will be delivered to clients compliant to the centralized
   conferencing framework through a number of mechanisms.  This could be
   through the conference control mechanism, the data model and
   conference package or out of band mechanisms such as E-Mail.
