1.  Introduction
    
    The third-generation partnership project 2 (3GPP2) for 3rd
    generation cellular telephony has defined a standard file format to
    contain audio/visual sequences which may be downloaded to cellular
    phones [3GPP2].  At the time of writing, the 3GPP2 file format (3G2)
    can contain H.263, H.264 or MPEG-4 video; and 13K Vocoder, EVRC or
    AMR Narrow-band speech, or AAC audio; and 3GPP timed text.
    
    Within the file, as with all files in the 'ISO' family, there is an
    intrinsic file-type box, which identifies those specifications to
    which the file complies, and which players (possibly compliant with
    only one specification) are permitted by the content author to play
    the file.  This identification is through four-letter 'brands'.
    Files identified by the MIME type defined in this document MUST
    contain a brand defined in a standard issued by 3GPP2 that can apply
    to 3GPP2 files, in their compatible brands list.
    
    The MIME types defined in this document are needed correctly to
    identify such files when they are served over HTTP, included in
    multi-part documents, or used in other places where MIME types are
    used.
    
    
1.1.  Conventions Used in this Document
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Security Considerations
    
    The 3GPP2 file format may contain audio, video, and displayable text
    data.  There is currently no provision for 'active' elements (such
    as scripts) of any kind.
    
    Clearly it is possible to author malicious files which attempt to
    call for an excessively large picture size, high sampling-rate audio
    etc.  However, clients can and usually do protect themselves against
    this kind of attack.
    
    It should be noted that selected metadata fields may encompass
    information partly intended to protect the media against
    unauthorized use or distribution.  In this case the intention is
    that alteration or removal of the data in the field would be treated
    as an offense under national agreements based World Intellectual
    Property Organization (WIPO) treaties.
    
    3GPP2 files have an extensible structure, so that it is
    theoretically possible that metadata fields or media formats could
    be defined in the future which could be used to induce particular
    actions on the part of the recipient, thus presenting additional
    security risks, but this type of capability is currently not
    supported in the referenced specification.
    
    Encryption, signing, and/or authentication of these file formats can
    be done using any media-independent transformations of the file or
    media data.
    
    
3.  MIME Types
    
    
    This registration applies to all files defined as using the '3G2'
    file format and identified with a suitable brand in a 3GPP2
    specification.  The usual file suffix for all these files is ".3g2".
    
3.1.  Files with audio but no video
    
    The type "audio/3gpp2" may be used for files containing audio but no
    visual presentation (neither video nor timed text, for example).

        audio
    MIME subtype name:
        3gpp2
    Required parameters:
        None
    Optional parameters:
        Codecs.  See [bucket]
    Optional parameter values:
        [C.S0050]
    Encoding considerations:
        This data is binary and should be transmitted in a suitable
        encoding without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit stripping etc.; base64
        is a suitable encoding.  Note that this MIME type is used only
        for files; separate types are used for real-time transfer, such
        as for the RTP payload format for 13K vocoder speech [RFC2658].
    Security considerations:
        See the security considerations section in RFC XXXX (this
        document)
    Interoperability considerations:
        The 3GPP2 organization has defined the specification of the
        media format [3gpp2].  Interoperability and conformance testing
        is done in cooperation with other bodies including the Open
        Mobile Alliance (OMA) <http://www.openmobilealliance.org> and
        the International Multimedia Telecommunications Consortium
        (IMTC) <http://www.imtc.org/>.
    Published specification:
        3GPP2 C.S0045, 3GPP2 C.S0050.
        
        3GPP2 specifications are publicly accessible at the 3GPP2 web
        site, <http://www.3gpp2.org>.
    Applications which use this media type:
        Multi-media
    Additional information:
        The type "audio/3gpp2" MAY be used for files containing audio
        but no visual presentation.  Files served under this type MUST
        NOT contain any visual material. (Note that 3GPP timed text is
        visually presented and is considered to be visual material).
    Magic number(s):
        None.  However, the file-type box must occur first in the file,
        and MUST contain a 3GPP2 brand in its compatible brands list.
    File extension(s):
        3g2 and 3gpp2 are both declared at <http://www.nist.gov/nics/>;
        3g2 is preferred
    Macintosh File Type Code(s):
        '3gp2'
