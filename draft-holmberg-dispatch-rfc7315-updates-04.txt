Abstract

   The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project 3GPP has identified cases
   where different SIP private header extensions referred to as P-
   header fields, defined in RFC 7315, need to be included in SIP
   requests and responses currently not allowed according to RFC 7315.
   This document updates RFC 7315, in order to allow inclusion of the
   affected P- header fields in such requests and responses.

   In order to get a complete picture, this document also contains a set
   of errata that are to be filed against RFC 7315, in order to fix
   misalignments that occurred when RFC 3455 was updated and obsoleted
   by RFC 7315.

1.  Introduction

   The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has identified cases
   where different Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] private
   header extensions referred to as P- header fields, defined in RFC
   7315 [RFC7315], need to be included in SIP requests and responses
   currently not allowed according to RFC 7315.  This document updates
   RFC 7315, in order to allow inclusion of the affected P- header
   fields in such requests and responses.

   In order to get a complete picture, this document also contains a set
   of errata that are to be filed against RFC 7315, in order to fix
   misalignments that occurred when RFC 3455 [RFC3455] was updated and
   obsoleted by RFC 7315.

Internet-Draft                7315 Updates                  January 2016


   This document updates RFC 7315 [RFC7315], by allowing the insertion
   of the P-Access-Network-Info header field in SIP ACK requests.

   As the P- header fields are mainly used in (and in most cases, only
   defined for) networks defined by the 3rd-Generation Partnership
   Project (3GPP), where the updates defined in this document are
   already defined [TS.3GPP.24.229], the updates are not seen to cause
   backward compatibility concerns.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Errata to RFC 7315

3.1.  General

   RFC 7315 contains contradicting statements regarding the usage of SIP
   P- header fields in SIP requests and responses, which leave the
   presence of the SIP P- header fields in the SIP requests and
   responses open to interpretation, and different implementations.
   Statements in section 5.7 are not aligned with the definitions and
   usage of the SIP P- header fields specified in section 4.

   This section defines the errata that is to be submitted against RFC
   7315.  The scope of the errata is only alignment between RFC 3455 and
   RFC 7315.

   NOTE: In the case of the P-Called-Party-ID header field, allowing it
   in PUBLISH requests was deliberately done in RFC 7315.  It will
   therefore not be impacted by the errata.

3.2.  Correction to section 5.7 of RFC 7315

   The errata makes the following changes:

   o  P-Associated-URI: Remove statement that the header field can
      appear in the SIP REGISTER method.

   o  P-Called-Party-ID: Delete statement that the header field can
      appear in SIP responses.  Add statement that the P-Called-Party-ID
      header field can appear in the SIP REFER method.

   o  P-Visited-Network-ID: Delete statement that the header field can
      appear in SIP responses.  Add statement that the P-Visited-

      Network-ID header field cannot appear in the SIP NOTIFY, PRACK,
      INFO and UPDATE methods.

   o  P-Access-Network-Info: Add statement that header field can appear
      in SIP responses.

   o  P-Charging-Vector: Add statement that the header field can appear
      in SIP responses.  Add statement that the header field can not
      appear in the SIP ACK method.

   o  P-Charging-Function-Addresses: Add statement that the P-Charging-
      Function-Addresses header field can appear in SIP responses.

   and 2xx resonses.  The P-Called-Party-ID header field can appear in

   responses.  The P-Visited-Network-ID header field can appear in all
   SIP methods except ACK, BYE, and CANCEL and all responses. The
   P-Access-Network-Info header field can appear in all SIP methods
   except ACK and CANCEL.  The P-Charging-Vector header field can appear
   in all SIP methods except CANCEL.  The P-Charging-Function-Addresses
   header field can appear in all SIP methods except ACK and CANCEL.

Internet-Draft                7315 Updates                  January 2016


4.1.  General

   This section updates section 5.7 of RFC 7315, based on requirements
   from 3GPP.  This section contains the 3GPP use-cases behind the
   updates, and the suggested changes.

4.2.  3GPP Use-cases

4.2.1.  P-Access-Network-Info

   The P-Access-Network-Info header field may contain the Network
   provided Location information (NPLI).  The Network Provided Location
   Information (NPLI) is described in 3GPP TS 23.228.

   A proxy in possession of appropriate information about the access
   technology might insert a P-Access-Network-Info header field with its
   own values.  Such values are identified by the string "network-
   provided" defined in RFC 7315.  Based on operator policy and/or
   roaming agreement, local time of visited network may be included.

   The CDRs generated within IMS have to contain the NPLI in order to
   guarantee correct billing.  When an IMS Session is modified the NPLI
   also needs to be stored as the location of the user at the time when
   the session is modified may generate a charging event.  In case of a
   session modification event at IMS, the NPLI needs to be provided:

   o  when the bearer establishment is triggered, or

   o  at session release when the bearer deactivation is triggered, or

   o  when the bearer modification is triggered e.g.  QoS modification
      for the use of newly negotiated codec.

   In some scenarios, the bearer modification may be triggered by the
   proxy upon reception of an SDP answer within SIP 2xx response to the
   SIP INVITE request.  In such case the NPLI needs to be provided
   within the SIP ACK request.  However, RFC 7315 does not allow the
   usage of the P-Access-Network-Info header field in SIP ACK request.

   Upon reception of the SDP answer within SIP 2xx response on the SIP
   INVITE request a proxy may initiate procedures to obtain the NPLI and
   MAY include the P-Access-Network-Info header field with the NPLI in
   the SIP ACK request.

   The P-Access-Network-Info header field shall not be included in SIP
   ACK requests triggered by a 3xx-6xx response.

Internet-Draft                7315 Updates                  January 2016


4.2.2.  P-Charging-Vector

   RFC 7315 defines an Inter Operator Identifier (IOI) to enable
   different operators involved in a SIP dialog or a transaction outside
   a dialog to identify each other by exchanging operator identification
   information within the P-Charging-Vector header field.

   In the interconnection scenarios in multi operator environments,
   where one or more transit operators are between the originating and
   terminating operator, the identities of the involved transit
   operators are represented by a transit-ioi parameter of the P-
   Charging-Vector header field.

   Transit operators can be selected independently for each SIP method
   and direction of request.  A transit network will only have knowledge
   of an individual SIP request and transit network selection will be an
   independent decision for each request and could be made based on
   load, cost, percentage, time of day, and more.  For this reason, it
   is necessary that the P-Charging-Vector header field, which carries
   the transit IOI information, is included in each SIP request and
   response.  However, RFC 7315 does not allow the usage of the
   P-Charging- Vector header field in SIP ACK request.

   A SIP proxy that supports this extension and receives the SIP ACK
   request MAY include a P-Charging-Vector header field in the SIP ACK
   request.

   The P-Charging-Vector header field shall not be included in SIP ACK
   requests triggered by a 3xx-6xx response.

4.3.  Updates to section 5.7 of RFC 7315

   Note that the old text incorporates the fixes done by the errata
   described above.

   The following updates are done:

   o  P-Access-Network-Info: Add statement that the header field can
      appear in the SIP ACK method.

   o  P-Charging-Vector: Add statement that the header field can appear
      in the SIP ACK method.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the P-Access-Network-Info header
   field are defined in [RFC7315].  The update defined in this document
   does not impact the security considerations.

   This document makes no requests from IANA.
