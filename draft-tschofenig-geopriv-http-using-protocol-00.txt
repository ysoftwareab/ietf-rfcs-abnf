Internet-Draft        GEOPRIV HTTPS Using Protocol             July 2007


Abstract

   This document describes an approach to to use Hypertext Transfer
   Protocol (HTTP) over Transport Layer Protocol (TLS) to transport
   Presence Information Data Format Location Objects (PIDF-LO) (see RFC
   4119).  It is a GEOPRIV using protocol as described in Section 5.2 or
   RFC 3693 to resolve an identifier, which denotes a reference, to a
   PIDF-LO.  The document assumes that the HTTP client possesses the
   reference that is obtained using a mechanism that are outside the
   scope of this document and conveys it to the HTTP server in order to
   retrieve a PIDF-LO in a response.

Internet-Draft        GEOPRIV HTTPS Using Protocol             July 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a strawman approach for HTTP [2] to transport
   PIDF-LO objects [3].  RFC 3693 [4], Section 5.2 says the following
   about Geopriv transport protocols:


      "A protocol that just transports the LO as a string of bits,
      without looking at them (like an IP storage protocol could do), is
      not a using protocol, but only a transport protocol.
      Nevertheless, the entity or protocol that caused the transport
      protocol to move the LO is responsible for the appropriate
      distribution, protection, usage, retention, and storage of the LO
      based on the rules that apply to that LO."

   While it might be possible to describe HTTP as a transport protocol
   and punt all of the requirements to the layer above HTTP, this
   document describes a layering of HTTP over TLS in use between client
   and server, so that a common set of mechanisms for privacy and
   authentication are established.

   A usage scenario envisioned by this document is described in
   Figure 1.

            Figure 2: Usage Scenario: End Host adding Reference

   The scenario presented in Figure 2 describes a SIP User Agent Alice
   using a reference to location information obtained using the Location
   Configuration Protocol (LC), such as HELD [11], RELO [13] or
   LocationRef [12].  This reference is then added to the SIP message to
   a SIP message (as described in [14]).  The SIP message travels from
   the Alice via the SIP proxy to UAS-C whereby the reference might be
   protected using S/MIME.

   When UAS-C receives a SIP message with an included reference then it
   resolves the reference to a PIDF-LO using the HTTPS mechanism
   specified in this document.

3.  Threat Models

   HTTP can be used as a substrate to a number of different
   applications, and defining a set of guidelines for conveying a
   PIDF-LO for any application which might use HTTP would be difficult
   or impossible.  This document does not attempt that task.  Instead,
   it is limited in applicability to the case where a client uses an
   HTTP GET request to retrieve a PIDF-LO object from a server.  No
   other functionality is covered.  This document does not describe how
   you would determine the URI of the PIDF-LO document or the
   appropriate server to query.

   This document assumes that the reference contains a random component
   and does not contain identity information as outlined in [16].

   There are three threat models that need to be described:

   Authorization Policy Threat Model:

      The assumption here is that the HTTP server also has has some
      authorization policies and is therefore able to control access to
      these policies.  Consequently, when the reference is conveyed to
      the potential Location Recipient (e.g., via SIP [14]), then it
      does not need to be protected (neither hop-by-hop nor end-to-end).
      Authentication by the Location Recipient is needed (e.g., TLS
      client authentication, HTTP Digest authenticatio, etc.) to
      disclose location information only to authorized entities.


   End-to-End Threat Model:

      In this threat model we assume that the reference is encryped end-
      to-end, for example using S/MIME and an adversay is not able to
      eavesdrop, modify or replay a reference.  Storing authorization
      policies at the Location Server is not necessary since the end
      host is able to control the disclosure of the PIDF-LO by making it
      available only to trusted entities.  Consequently, only the entity
      that is able to decrypt the end-to-end protected object (in our
      case the S/MIME encrypted object) can use the reference to resolve
      it to a PIDF-LO.


   Hop-by-Hop Threat Model:

      This threat model assumes the reference can either be directly
      communication between the Target and the Location Recipient or
      that involved proxies are trusted.  In some cases this threat
      model is also applicable the reference is conveyed to multiple

      Location Recipients (such as intermediaries and the final
      communication end point as it is true for location-based routing).
      The party that sees the reference has to be able to resolve it
      into a PIDF-LO.

   The first threat model requires client authentication and therefore
   we describe a mechanism to apply the Geopriv authorization policy
   framework (see [5] and [10]) to HTTP.

Internet-Draft        GEOPRIV HTTPS Using Protocol             July 2007


4.  Steps for Retrieval

   1.  The client uses HTTPS [6] to connect to the server.

   2.  The client establishes an HTTPS connection to the server, as
       described in RFC 2818.  At the TLS layer, the use of
       TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL MUST NOT be used as the CipherSuite.

   3.  The client authenticates to the server.

   4.  The client retrieves the resource.  The client retrieves the
       PIDF-LO resource using an HTTP GET request.

5.  Structure of Authorization Documents

   An authorization document is an XML document, formatted according to
   the schema defined in [5].  The authorization documents used by this
   document inherit the MIME type of common policy documents,
   application/auth-policy+xml.  As described in [5], an authorization
   document is composed of rules which contain three parts - conditions,
   actions, and transformations.  Each action or transformation, which
   is also called a permission, has the property of being a positive
   grant of information to a Location Recipient.  As a result, there is
   a well-defined mechanism for combining actions and transformations
   obtained from several sources.  This mechanism is privacy safe, since
   the lack of any action or transformation can only result in less
   information being presented to a watcher.

   This section describes how the identity and sphere elements are
   instantiated.  No new conditions, actions and transformations are
   defined.

5.1.  Conditions

5.1.1.  Identity

   Although the <identity> element is defined in [5], that specification
   indicates that the specific usages of the framework document need to
   define details that are protocol and usage specific.  In particular,
   it is necessary for a usage of the Common Policy framework to:

   o  Define acceptable means of authentication.

   o  Define the procedure for representing the identity of the WR
      (Watcher/Requestor) as a URI or a IRI [8].

5.1.1.1.  Acceptable Forms of Authentication

   A request is considered authenticated if one of the following
   techniques is used:

   HTTP Digest:

      The presence agent has authenticated the Location Recipient using
      HTTP digest authentication [9].


   TLS Authentication:

      [[Editor's Note: More complex description since the different
      identities used for TLS authentication need to be mapped to a URI



Tschofenig & Schulzrinne  Expires January 3, 2008               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft        GEOPRIV HTTPS Using Protocol             July 2007


      or a IRI. ]]


   Identity Condition within a SAML Assertion:

      TBD

   Since HTTP Basic authentication is not recommended it is not
   described above.

5.1.1.2.  Computing a URI for the Location Recipient

   For requests that are authenticated using HTTP Digest, the identity
   of the Location Recipient is set equal to the concatenation of the
   following case-sensitive items in the given order:

   1.  the scheme https to 'https:'

   2.  the content of the username parameter (i.e., username-value) of
       the as carried in the Authorization Request Header as defined in
       Section 3.2.2 of [9]

   3.  '@' token

   4.  The content of the realm parameter.  Note that the realm
       parameter MUST be chosen in such a way that it does not contain
       '@' token.  [[Editor's note: Alternatively, we could relax this
       restriction and determine whether it would be OK to use ':'
       instead of '@' for concatenation.  As an example, this would lead
       to examples like Mufasa:myhost@testrealm.com]]

   The concatenated parameters are alwyas a URI since the username
   parameter is a URI as specified in and the realm parameter is also a
   URI with the above-mentioned constraint.  Consider the following
   example and the respective result-URI.


       digest username: alice
       digest realm: example.com
       URI: https:alice@example.com

5.1.2.  Sphere

   The <sphere> element is defined in [5].  However, each application
   making use of the common policy specification needs to determine how
   the presence server computes the value of the sphere to be used in
   the evaluation of the condition.

Internet-Draft        GEOPRIV HTTPS Using Protocol             July 2007


   This document does not provide an instantiation of the <sphere>
   element.  Hence, the <sphere> element is not present in an
   authorization policy document defined in this document.

5.2.  Matching with GEOPRIV Using Protocol Requirements

   This section compares the GEOPRIV requirements described in [4] with
   the approach outlined in this document.

   Section 7.1 of [4] details the requirements of a "Location Object".
   We discuss these requirements in the subsequent list.

   Req. 1.  (Location Object generalities):

      *  Regarding requirement 1.1, the Location Object has to be
         understood by the Location Recipient and the Location Server,
         the two communication end points.  The PIDF-LO [3] allows both
         civic and geospatial location information to be used.

      *  Regarding requirement 1.2, a number of fields in the civic
         location information format are optional.

      *  Regarding requirement 1.3, the civic location information is
         defined in an extensible way.

      *  Regarding requirement 1.4, the location information itself is
         not defined in this document.

      *  Regarding requirement 1.5, the protocol described in this
         document allows the Location Recipient to resolve a reference
         to a PIDF-LO only.

      *  Regarding requirement 1.6, the Location Object contains both
         location information and privacy rules.  Depending on the
         deployment scenario, which is outside the scope of this
         document, the privacy rules might have stronger or a weaker
         semantic.

      *  Regarding requirement 1.7, the Location Object is usable in a
         variety of protocols.

      *  Regarding requirement 1.8, no change regarding with respect to
         the encoding of the Location Object (see RFC 4119 [3]) was made
         by this document.

Internet-Draft        GEOPRIV HTTPS Using Protocol             July 2007


   Req. 2.  (Location Object fields):

      *  Regarding requirement 2.1, depending on the deployment scenario
         an identifier pointing to the Target may be carried inside the
         PIDF-LO since the PIDF object provides the ability to carry
         this identifier.  In some circumstances it might be desirable
         not to carry information about the Target's identity in the
         PIDF-LO.

      *  Regarding requirement 2.2, depending on the deployment scenario
         the Location Server might require that the Location Recipient
         performs an authentication step.  The security mechanisms for
         client and server authentication are outside the scope of this
         document and defined already for HTTPS itself.  This document,
         however, outlines how the authenticated identity is
         instantiated for usage with the authorization policy framework.

      *  Regarding requirement 2.3, proof of possession of the Location
         Recipient credentials is provided outside the scope of this
         document.  The security mechanisms defined for HTTPS are
         utilized by this document.

      *  Regarding requirement 2.5, RFC 4119 defines the basis for
         carrying location information in a PIDF document.  The ability
         to extend RFC 4119 to convey motion specific information is
         work in progress.

      *  Regarding requirement 2.6, this document as specified only
         allows the Location Recipient to resolve the reference but it
         does not provide the capability to indicate which location
         format or granularity has to be returned.

      *  Regarding requirement 2.7, the PIDF-LO relevant elements and
         attributes are available.  [[Editor's Note: I need to lookup
         whether the PIDF-LO contains 'sighting time' and 'TTL']]

      *  Regarding requirement 2.8, a reference to an external (more
         detailed rule set) is provided within the PIDF-LO.

      *  Regarding requirement 2.9, security headers and trailers are
         provided Transport Layer Security.

      *  Regarding requirement 2.10, extensibility within the PIDF-LO is
         provided regarding the definition of namespaces.

   Req. 3.  (Location Data Types):

      *  Regarding requirement 3.1, RFC 4119 [3] defines geospatial
         location information as the mandatory to implement location
         format.

      *  With the support of civic and geospatial location information
         in RFC 4119 [3] the requirement 3.2 is fulfilled.

      *  Regarding requirement 3.3, the geospatial location information
         used by this document only refers to absolute coordinates.
         However, the granularity of the location information can be
         reduced with the help of the AltRes, LoRes, LaRes fields
         described in [7].

      *  Regarding requirement 3.4, since the PIDF-LO format is designed
         to be extensible it allows further location information to be
         defined in the future.

   Section 7.2 of [4] details the requirements of a "Using Protocol".
   These requirements are listed below:


   Req. 4.:  The using protocol has to obey the privacy and security
      instructions coded in the Location Object regarding the
      transmission and storage of the LO.  This document carries the
      PIDF-LO as is via HTTPS from the Location Server to the Location
      Recipient.  The sending and receiving parties must obey the
      instructions carried inside the object.


   Req. 5.:  The using protocol will typically facilitate that the keys
      associated with the credentials are transported to the respective
      parties, that is, key establishment is the responsibility of the
      using protocol.  This document does not define additional security
      mechanisms beyond HTTPS.


   Req. 6.  (Single Message Transfer):  In particular, for tracking of
      small target devices, the design should allow a single message/
      packet transmission of location as a complete transaction.  The
      encoding of the RFC 4119-defined Location Object format is not
      changed.  Because of the verbose XML encoding it is not tailored
      towards inclusion into a single message.

   Section 7.3 of [4] details the requirements of a "Rule based Location
   Data Transfer".  These requirements are listed below:

Internet-Draft        GEOPRIV HTTPS Using Protocol             July 2007


   Req. 7.  (LS Rules):  Depending on the deployment environment access
      to location information might be controlled by authorization rules
      created by the Rule Maker or by a short-lived reference that
      contains a unguessable random component provided by the Target (or
      by an entity on behalf of the Target).


   Req. 8.  (LG Rules):  In context of Location-by-Reference it is not
      possible that there is no relationship between the LG and the LS.
      As such, the statement made in Req. 7 applies.


   Req. 9.  (Viewer Rules):  The Rule Maker might define (via mechanisms
      outside the scope of this document) which policy rules are
      disclosed to other entities.  These mechanisms are available with
      [10].


   Req. 10.  (Full Rule language):  Geopriv has defined a rule language
      capable of expressing a wide range of privacy rules which is
      applicable in the area of the distribution of Location Objects.
      The format of these rules are described in [5] and [10].


   Req. 11.  (Limited Rule language):  A limited (or basic) ruleset was
      introduced with PIDF-LO [3]).

   Section 7.4 of [4] details the requirements of a "Location Object
   Privacy and Security".  These requirements are listed below:


   Req. 12 (Identity Protection):  Identity protection of the Target can
      be provided if (a) the protocol used to convey the reference does
      not disclose the identity of the Target and (b) if the PIDF-LO
      does not contain information about the identity about the Target.
      Currently, there is no mechanism available that allows the Target
      to tell the LS not to include identity information in the PIDF-LO.


   Req. 13.  (Credential Requirements):  The security mechanism
      specified in this document is Transport Layer Security.  TLS
      offers the ability to use different types of credentials,
      including symmetric, asymmetric credentials or a combination of
      them.

   Req. 14.  (Security Features):  Geopriv defines a few security
      requirements for the protection of Location Objects such as mutual
      end-point authentication, data object integrity, data object
      confidentiality and replay protection.  The ability to use
      Transport Layer security fulfills these requirements.


   Req. 15.  (Minimal Crypto):  [[Editor's Note: A mandatory to
      implement ciphersuite has to be specified in this document.]]

7.  Security Considerations

   This document assumes that the use of TLS as substrate to HTTP is
   sufficient to protect the privacy of the PIDF-LO content while in
   flight.  When access control has to be applied prior to conveying the
   PIDF-LO towards the Location Recipient then the content of
   Section 5.1 is applicable.  The description about instantiating the
   identity element allows the Common Policy authorization framework to
   be used.  In order to make reasonable authorization decisions the
   Location Recipient needs to be authenticated (e.g., using HTTP Digest
   Authentication or client-side TLS authentication) or to present
   authorization information in the form of a SAML assertion.  There is
   ongoing work to update Digest Authentication, and those may
   eventually require an update to the recommended authentication
   method.  If access control is not applied as described in the threat
   models in Section 3 then the possession of the reference to location
   information that must fulfill certain charactistics (such as
   containing a random component) is sufficient to obtain be authorized
   to resolve the reference to a PIDF-LO.

9.  Open Issues

   This document contains a couple of open issues and is primarily meant
   to stimulate some discussions around dereferencing of HTTPS URIs to
   PIDF-LOs.  A further open issue is whether a GEOPRIV using protocol
   should also define steps for publication of PIDF-LOs, as described
   below.

9.1.  Steps for publication

9.1.1.  The client uses HTTPS to connect to the server

   The client establishes an HTTPS connection to the server, as
   described in RFC 2818.  At the TLS layer, the use of
   TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL MUST NOT be used as the CipherSuite.

9.1.2.  The client authenticates to the server

   The client authenticates to the server using HTTP's digest
   authentication mechanism as described in RFC 2617 and updated by the
   errata.

9.1.3.  The client publishes the resource

   The client publishes the PIDF-LO resource using an HTTP PUT request.
