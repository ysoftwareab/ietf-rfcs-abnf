Abstract

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 [2] (DHCPv6)
   provides a framework for passing configuration information to hosts
   on a TCP/IP network.  Configuration parameters and other control
   information are carried in tagged data items that are stored in the
   "options" field of the DHCPv6 message.  The data items themselves are
   also called "options."

   This document specifies the current set of DHCPv6 options.  This
   document will be periodically updated as new options are defined.
   Each superseding document will include the entire current list of
   valid options.

Internet Draft              DHCPv6 Options              22 November 1995


1. Introduction

   This document specifies options for use with the Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol for IP version 6, DHVPv6.  The full
   description of DHCPv6 packet formats may be found in the DHCPv6
   specification document [2].

   This document defines the format of information in the last field of
   DHCPv6 packets ('options').  The options defined within this document
   specify a generalized use of this area for giving information useful
   to a wide class of machines, operating systems and configurations.
   Sites with a single DHCPv6 server that is shared among heterogeneous
   clients may choose to define other, site- specific formats for the
   use of the 'options' field.

   Section 2 of this memo describes the formats of DHCPv6 options.

   Information on registering new options is contained in section 10.
   Although option numbers in this document correspond exactly to the
   same option numbers in the options specification for IPv4 [1], there
   is no requirement to keep numbering future options in any consistent
   manner except purely as a matter of editorial and cross-referencing
   convenience.


2. DHCPv6 Option Field Format

   DHCPv6 options have the same format as the BOOTP "vendor extensions"
   defined in RFC 1497 [9].  Options may be fixed length or variable
   length.  All options begin with a tag octet, which uniquely
   identifies the option.  Fixed-length options without data consist
   of only a tag octet.  Only options 0 and 255 are fixed length.  All
   other options are variable-length with a length octet following the
   tag octet.  The value of the length octet does not include the two
   octets specifying the tag and length.  The length octet is followed
   by "length" octets of data.  In the case of some variable-length
   options the length field is a constant but must still be specified.

   Any options defined subsequent to this document should contain a
   length octet even if the length is fixed or zero.

   All multi-octet quantities are in network byte-order.

   Option codes 128 to 254 (decimal) are reserved for site-specific
   options.

   All of the options described in this document will also have their
   default values specified, if any.

3. Option specifications

3.1. Pad Option

   The pad option can be used to cause subsequent fields to align on
   word boundaries.

   The code for the pad option is 0, and its length is 1 octet.

    Code
   +-----+
   |  0  |
   +-----+


3.2. End Option

   The end option marks the end of valid information in the vendor
   field.  Subsequent octets should be filled with pad options.

   The code for the end option is 255, and its length is 1 octet.

    Code
   +-----+
   | 255 |
   +-----+


3.3. Routing Prefix size

   The routing prefix size option specifies the length of the routing
   prefix, counting the number of leading 1 bits to be applied to the
   client's IPv6 address to get the routing prefix.

   If both the routing prefix size and the router option are specified
   in a DHCPv6 reply, the routing prefix size option MUST be first.

   The code for the routing size prefix option is 1, and its length is 1
   octet.

    Code   Len  Prefix Size
   +-----+-----+------+
   |  1  |  1  | size |

   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--


4. IP Layer Parameters per Host

   This section details the options that affect the operation of the IP
   layer on a per-host basis.


4.1. Maximum Datagram Reassembly Size

   This option specifies the maximum size datagram that the client
   should be prepared to reassemble.  The size is specified as a 16-bit
   unsigned integer.  The minimum value legal value is 576 [3].

   The code for this option is 22, and its length is 2.

    Code   Len      Size
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |  22 |  2  |  s1 |  s2 |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+


4.2. Default IP Time-to-live

   |  24 |  4  |  t1 |  t2 |  t3 |  t4 |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+


5. IP Layer Parameters per Interface

   This section details the options that affect the operation of the IP
   layer on a per-interface basis.  It is expected that a client can
   issue multiple requests, one per interface, in order to configure
   interfaces with their specific parameters.


5.1. Interface MTU Option

   This option specifies the MTU to use on this interface.  The MTU is
   specified as a 16-bit unsigned integer.  The minimum legal value for
   the MTU is 68.

   The code for this option is 26, and its length is 2.

    Code   Len      MTU

   +-----+-----+-----+-----+


5.2. Static Route Option

   This option specifies a list of static routes that the client
   should install in its routing cache.  If multiple routes to the same
   destination are specified, they are listed in descending order of
   priority.

   The routes consist of a list of IP address pairs.  The first address
   is the destination address, and the second address is the router for
   the destination.

   The default route (0.0.0.0) is an illegal destination for a static
   route.  See section 3.5 for information about the router option.

   The code for this option is 33.  The minimum length of this option is
   32, and the length MUST be a multiple of 16.

    Code   Len         Destination 1           Router 1

6. TCP Parameters

   This section lists the options that affect the operation of the TCP
   layer on a per-interface basis.


6.1. TCP Default TTL Option

   This option specifies the default TTL that the client should use when
   sending TCP segments.  The value is represented as an 8-bit unsigned
   integer.  The minimum value is 1.

   The code for this option is 37, and its length is 1.

    Code   Len   TTL
   +-----+-----+-----+
   |  37 |  1  |  n  |
   +-----+-----+-----+


6.2. TCP Keepalive Interval Option

   This option specifies the interval (in seconds) that the client TCP
   should wait before sending a keepalive message on a TCP connection.
   The time is specified as a 32-bit unsigned integer.  A value of zero
   indicates that the client should not generate keepalive messages on
   connections unless specifically requested by an application.

   The code for this option is 38, and its length is 4.

    Code   Len           Time
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |  38 |  4  |  t1 |  t2 |  t3 |  t4 |

7. Application and Service Parameters

   This section details some miscellaneous options used to configure
   miscellaneous applications and services.


7.1. Network Time Protocol Servers Option

   This option specifies a list of IP addresses indicating NTP [4]
   servers available to the client.  Servers SHOULD be listed in order
   of preference.

   The code for this option is 42.  Its minimum length is 16, and the
   length MUST be a multiple of 16.

    Code   Len         Address 1               Address 2
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
   |  42 |  n  |  a1 |  a2 |  a3 | ... | a16 |  a1 |  ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--


7.2. Vendor Specific Information

   This option is used by clients and servers to exchange vendor-
   specific information.  The information is an opaque object of n
   octets, presumably interpreted by vendor-specific code on the clients
   and servers.  The definition of this information is vendor specific.
   The vendor is indicated in the class-identifier option.  Servers
   not equipped to interpret the vendor-specific information sent by a
   client MUST ignore it (although it may be reported).  Clients which
   do not receive desired vendor-specific information SHOULD make an
   attempt to operate without it, although they may do so (and announce
   they are doing so) in a degraded mode.

   If a vendor potentially encodes more than one item of information
   in this option, then the vendor SHOULD encode the option using
   "Encapsulated vendor-specific options" as described below:

   The Encapsulated vendor-specific options field SHOULD be encoded as
   a sequence of type/length/value fields of identical syntax to the
   DHCPv6 options field with the following exceptions:

      -    Codes other than 0 or 255 MAY be redefined by the vendor
           within the encapsulated vendor-specific extensions field,
           but SHOULD conform to the tag-length-value syntax defined in

Internet Draft              DHCPv6 Options              22 November 1995


      -    Code 255 (END), if present, signifies the end of the
           encapsulated vendor extensions, not the end of the vendor
           extensions field.  If no code 255 is present, then the end of
           the enclosing vendor-specific information field is taken as
           the end of the encapsulated vendor-specific extensions field.

   The code for this option is 43 and its minimum length is 1.

   Code   Len   Vendor-specific information
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+---
   |  43 |  n  |  i1 |  i2 | ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+---

   When encapsulated vendor-specific extensions are used, the
   information bytes 1-n have the following format:

    Code   Len   Data item        Code   Len   Data item       Code
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |  T1 |  n  |  d1 |  d2 | ... |  T2 |  n  |  D1 |  D2 | ... | ... |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+


7.3. X Window System Font Server Option

   This option specifies a list of X Window System [11] Font servers
   available to the client.  Servers SHOULD be listed in order of
   preference.

   The code for this option is 48.  The minimum length of this option is
   16 octets, and the length MUST be a multiple of 16.

    Code   Len         Address 1               Address 2
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---
   |  48 |  n  |  a1 |  a2 | ... | a16 |  a1 |  a2 |   ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---


7.4. X Window System Display Manager Option

   This option specifies a list of IP addresses of systems that are
   running the X Window System Display Manager [11] and are available to
   the client.

   Addresses SHOULD be listed in order of preference.

   The code for the this option is 49.  The minimum length of this
   option is 16, and the length MUST be a multiple of 16.

8. DHCPv6 Extensions

   This section details the options that are specific to DHCPv6.


8.1. Requested IP Address

   This option is used in a DHCPv6 [2] client request (DISCOVER) to
   allow the client to request that a particular IP address be assigned.

   The code for this option is 50, and its length is 16.

    Code   Len   Address
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |  50 |  n  |  a1 |  a2 | ... | a16 |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+


8.2. Parameter Request List

   This option is used by a DHCPv6 client to request values for
   specified configuration parameters.  The list of requested parameters
   is specified as n octets, where each octet is a valid DHCPv6 option
   code as defined in this document.

   The client MAY list the options in order of preference.  The DHCPv6
   server is not required to return the options in the requested order,
   but MUST try to insert the requested options in the order requested
   by the client.

   The code for this option is 55.  Its minimum length is 1.

    Code   Len   Option Codes
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+---
   |  55 |  n  |  c1 |  c2 | ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+---


8.3. Message

   This option is used by a DHCPv6 server to provide an error message to
   a DHCPv6 client in a CONF-RESPONSE message in the event of a failure.

Internet Draft              DHCPv6 Options              22 November 1995


   A client may use this option in a CONF-RESPONSE message to indicate
   the why the client declined the offered parameters.  The message
   consists of n octets of NVT ASCII [8] text, which the client may
   display on an available output device.

   The code for this option is 56 and its minimum length is 1.

    Code   Len     Text
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+---
   |  56 |  n  |  c1 |  c2 | ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+---


8.4. Maximum DHCPv6 Message Size

   This option specifies the maximum length DHCPv6 message that it is
   willing to accept.  The length is specified as an unsigned 16-bit
   integer.  A client may use the maximum DHCPv6 message size option
   in DISCOVER or CONF-REQUEST messages, but should not use the option
   in CONF-RESPONSE messages (see [2] for DISCOVER, CONF-REQUEST, and
   CONF-RESPONSE message formats).

   The code for this option is 57, and its length is 2.  The minimum
   legal value is 576 octets.

    Code   Len     Length
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |  57 |  2  |  l1 |  l2 |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+


8.5. Class-identifier

   This option is used by DHCPv6 clients to optionally identify the type
   and configuration of a DHCPv6 client.  The information is a string of
   n octets, interpreted by servers.  Vendors and sites may choose to
   define specific class identifiers to convey particular configuration
   or other identification information about a client.  For example, the
   identifier may encode the client's hardware configuration.  Servers
   not equipped to interpret the class-specific information sent by a
   client MUST ignore it (although it may be reported).

   The code for this option is 60, and its minimum length is 1.

   Code   Len   Class-Identifier
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+---
   |  60 |  n  |  i1 |  i2 | ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+---

8.6. Client-identifier

   This option is used by DHCPv6 clients to specify their unique
   identifier.  DHCPv6 servers use this value to index their database
   of address bindings.  This value is expected to be unique for all
   clients in an administrative domain.

   It is expected that this field will typically contain a hardware type
   and hardware address, but this is not required.  Current legal values
   for hardware types are defined in [10].

   The code for this option is 61, and its minimum length is 2.

   Code   Len   Type  Client-Identifier
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---
   |  61 |  n  |  t1 |  i1 |  i2 | ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---


8.7. Mobile Home Address Option

   When this option is present in a client request message, the DHCPv6
   server is asked to send an appropriate home address to the mobile
   host.  The DHCPv6 server, in its corresponding offering message, will
   insert the requested address into the usual place for requested IP
   addresses.  The DHCPv6 server will typically notify the mobile host
   of (one of) its home agents' addresses, as configured by the local
   administration to be associated with the address given to the mobile
   host.  That home agent's IP address is inserted in the data field of
   the mobile home address option.

   It is anticipated that the mobile-IP working group will approve one
   of the current proposals for allowing a mobile host, with its already
   known mobile home address, to dynamically discover the location of a
   home agent serving the home address.  In that case, the DHCPv6 server
   may be configured to send out mobile home addresses and expect that
   the mobile host discover the home agent's address by whichever method
   is approved by the working group.

   It is also anticipated that many installations will allow several
   home agents to serve the same mobile home addresses, for redundancy
   or load sharing.  For this reason, we have also allowed for the
   possibility that the DHCPv6 server may wish to insert multiple home
   agent addresses in the mobile home address option.

   The format of the mobile home address option is as follows:

            Code Len    Home Agent Addresses (zero or more)

Internet Draft              DHCPv6 Options              22 November 1995


            +----+----+ - -+ - -+-----+ - --+ - -+ - -+ - -+
            | 68 | n  | a1 | a2 | ... | a16 | ...
            +----+----+ - -+ - -+-----+ - --+ - -+ - -+ - -+

   The code for the mobile home address option is 68.  The length is
   16 octets multiplied by the number of home agents supplied in the
   option, which may be zero or more.  It is expected that the usual
   length will be sixteen octets, containing a single home agent's
   address.


9. Neighbor Discovery Extensions

   This section contains option definitions for specifying parameters
   that are useful with IPv6 Neighbor Discovery [7].


10. Extensions

   Additional generic data fields may be registered by contacting:

      Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
      USC/Information Sciences Institute
      4676 Admiralty Way
      Marina del Rey, California  90292-6695

      or by email as: iana@isi.edu

   Implementation specific use of undefined generic types (including
   those in the range 69-127) may conflict with other implementations,
   and registration is required.


11. Acknowledgements

   Quite a bit of this internet draft is copied directly from
   RFC1533 [1], written by Steve Alexander and Ralph Droms.


12. Security Considerations

   Security issues are not discussed in this memo.  However, there
   is an urgent need to define some security protocol for use with
   DHCPv6, since otherwise malicious parties could create numerous
   denial-of-service style attacks based on depleting available server
   resources or providing corrupted or infected data to unsuspecting
   clients.
