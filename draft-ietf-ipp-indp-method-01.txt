Abstract

The IPP Event Notification specification [ipp-ntfy] is an OPTIONAL
extension to IPP/1.0, IPP/1.1, and future versions.  [ipp-ntfy] requires
the definition of one or more Delivery Methods in separate Delivery
Method Documents for the Printer to dispatch Event Notifications to
Notification Recipients. This Delivery Method Document defines the
semantics and syntax of the 'indp' Notification Delivery Method.  For
this Delivery Method, an IPP Printer sends (pushes) an IPP Event
Notifications request to the Notification Recipients using the Send-
Notifications operation defined in this document.  The Notification
Recipient returns a response to the Printer.  The Send-Notifications
operation uses the same Encoding and Transport as IPP itself.

INTERNET-DRAFT   IPP: The INDP Notification Delivery MethodJuly 6, 2000


The full set of IPP documents includes:

  Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol [RFC2567]
  Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the Internet
     Printing Protocol [RFC2568]
  Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics [ipp-mod]
  Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport [ipp-pro]
  Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Implementer's Guide [ipp-iig]
  Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols [RFC2569]
  Internet Printing Protocol (IPP):  IPP Event Notification
     Specification [ipp-ntfy]


The "Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol" document takes a
broad look at distributed printing functionality, and it enumerates
real-life scenarios that help to clarify the features that need to be
included in a printing protocol for the Internet.  It identifies
requirements for three types of users: end users, operators, and
administrators.  It calls out a subset of end user requirements that are
satisfied in IPP/1.0.  A few OPTIONAL operator operations have been
added to IPP/1.1.

The "Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the Internet
Printing Protocol" document describes IPP from a high level view,
defines a roadmap for the various documents that form the suite of IPP
specification documents, and gives background and rationale for the IETF
working group's major decisions.

The "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport" document is
a formal mapping of the abstract operations and attributes defined in
the model document onto HTTP/1.1 [RFC2616].  It defines the encoding
rules for a new Internet MIME media type called "application/ipp".  This
document also defines the rules for transporting a message body over
HTTP whose Content-Type is "application/ipp".  This document defines a
new scheme named 'ipp' for identifying IPP printers and jobs.

The "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Implementer's Guide" document gives
insight and advice to implementers of IPP clients and IPP objects.  It
is intended to help them understand IPP/1.1 and some of the
considerations that may assist them in the design of their client and/or
IPP object implementations.  For example, a typical order of processing
requests is given, including error checking.  Motivation for some of the
specification decisions is also included.

The "Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols" document gives some advice
to implementers of gateways between IPP and LPD (Line Printer Daemon)
implementations.

The "Internet Printing Protocol (IPP):  IPP Event Notification
Specification" document defines the semantics for Subscription Creation
Operations and the requirements for other Delivery Method documents to
define a Delivery Method to carry an Event Notifications to a
Notification Recipient.

INTERNET-DRAFT   IPP: The INDP Notification Delivery MethodJuly 6, 2000




1  Introduction

The notification extension document [ipp-ntfy] defines operations that a
client can perform in order to create Subscription Objects in a Printer
and carry out other operations on them. A Subscription Object represents
a Subscription abstraction. The Subscription Object specifies that when
one of the specified Events occurs, the Printer sends an asynchronous
Event Notification to the specified Notification Recipient via the
specified Delivery Method (i.e., protocol).

The notification extension document [ipp-ntfy] specifies that each
Delivery Method is defined in another document. This document is one
such document, and it specifies the .indp. Delivery Method.

For the .indp. Delivery Method, an IPP Printer sends (pushes) a Send-
Notifications operation request containing one or more Event
Notifications to a Notification Recipient.  The Notification Recipient
returns a response to the Printer.  The Send-Notifications operation
uses the same Encoding and Transport as IPP itself.


2  Terminology

This document uses terms such as "attributes", "keywords", and
"support".  These terms have special meaning and are defined in the
model terminology [ipp-mod] section 12.2.

Capitalized terms, such as MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT,
MAY, NEED NOT, and OPTIONAL, have special meaning relating to
conformance.  These terms are defined in [ipp-mod] section 12.1 on
conformance terminology, most of which is taken from RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

This document uses the capitalized terms, such as Notification
Recipient, Event Notification, Printer, etc.,  that are defined in [ipp-
ntfy] with the same meanings and are not reproduced here.

This section defines the following additional terms that are used
throughout this document:

  Event Notification Attributes Group . The attributes group in a
     request that contains Event Notification Attributes in a request or
     response.

3  Model and Operation

See [ipp-ntfy] for the description of the Event Notification Model and
Operation.  This Delivery Method takes advantage of combining several
Event Notifications into a single Compound Event Notification that is
delivery by a single Send-Notification operation to a single
Notification Recipient.

INTERNET-DRAFT   IPP: The INDP Notification Delivery MethodJuly 6, 2000


When creating each Subscription object, the client supplies the "notify-
recipient" (uri) Subscription Template attribute.  The "notify-
recipient" attribute specifies both a single Notification Recipient that
is to receive the Notifications when subsequent events occur and the
method for notification delivery that the IPP Printer is to use.  For
the Notification Delivery Method defined in this document, the
notification method is 'indp' and the rest of the URI is the address of
the Notification Recipient to which the IPP Printer will send the Send-
Notifications operation.

The 'indp' Notification Delivery Method defined in this document uses a
client/server protocol paradigm.  The "client" in this relationship is
the Printer described in [ipp-ntfy] while the "server" is the
Notification Recipient. The Printer invokes the Send-Notifications
operation to communicate IPP Event Notification contents to the
Notification Recipient. The Notification Recipient only conveys
information to the Printer in the form of responses to the operations
initiated by the Printer.

Printers that implement the 'indp' Notification Delivery Method will
need to include an HTTP client stack while Notification Recipients that
implement this Delivery Method will need to support an HTTP server
stack.  See section 11.2 for more details.


4  Summary of the 'indp' Delivery Method

Column 1 of Table 1 lists the conformance requirements for Delivery
Method Documents as specified in [ipp-ntfy].  Column 2 indicates how

INTERNET-DRAFT   IPP: The INDP Notification Delivery MethodJuly 6, 2000


9.1 Send-Notifications operation


This REQUIRED operation allows a Printer to send one or more Event
Notifications to a Notification Recipient using HTTP.

The Printer composes the information defined for an IPP Notification
[ipp-ntfy] and sends it using the Sent-Notifications operation to the
Notification Recipient supplied in the Subscription object.

The Send-Notifications operations uses the operations model defined by
IPP [rfc2566].  This includes, the use of a URI as the identifier for
the target of each operation, the inclusion of a version number,
operation-id, and request-id in each request, and the definition of
attribute groups. The Send-Notifications operation uses the Operation
Attributes group, but currently has no need for the Unsupported
Attributes, Printer Object Attributes, and Job-Object Attributes groups.
However, it uses a new attribute group, the Event Notification
Attributes group.



The Notification Recipient MUST accept the request in any state. There
is no state defined for the Notification Recipient for this Delivery
Method.

Access Rights:  To send Event Notifications to a Notification Recipient,
the authenticated user (see [IPP-MOD] section 8.3) performing this
operation MUST be the Printer that accepted a previous Subscription
Creation operation (see [ipp-ntfy]).  Otherwise the Notification
Recipient MUST reject the operation and return: the .client-error-
forbidden., .client-error-not-authenticated., or .client-error-not-
authorized. status code as appropriate.

ISSUE 01:  Is this what the Access Rights section should say for a Send-
Notifications request?


9.1.1 Send-Notifications Request

Every operation request MUST contains the following parameters (see
[ipp-mod] section 3.1.1):

     - a "version-number"    ISSUE 02:  What version number goes here?
     - an "operation-id" - the value defined in Table 2
     - a "request-id" - the contents of the Subscription object's
       "notify-sequence-number" after incrementing for the first try
       (see [ipp-ntfy]).

The following groups of attributes MUST be part of the Send-
Notifications Request:

Group 1: Operation Attributes
     Natural Language and Character Set:

          The "attributes-charset" and "attributes-natural-language"
          attributes as defined in [ipp-mod] section 3.1.4.1.

     Target:
          A copy of the Subscription object's "notification-recipient-
          uri" (uri) attribute which is the target of this operation as
          described in [ipp-mod] section 3.1.5, i.e., the URI of the
          'indp' Notification Recipient (see section 9.2).

  Requesting User Name:
     Unlike the other IPP operations, the .requesting-user-name.
     attribute SHOULD NOT be supplied by the client as described in
     [ipp-mod] section 8.3.
          ISSUE 03:  Ok that "requesting-user-name" SHOULD NOT be send
          in Send-Notifications?

Group 2 to N: Event Notification Attributes

     In each group 2 to N, each attribute is encoded using the IPP rules
     for encoding attributes [ipp-pro] and may be encoded in any order.
     Note: the Get-Jobs response in [ipp-mod] acts as a model for
     encoding multiple groups of attributes.

     Each Event Notification Group MUST contain all of attributes
     specified in [ipp-ntfy] section 9.1 (.Content of Machine Consumable
     Event Notifications.) with exceptions denoted by asterisks in the
     tables below.

     The tables below are copies of the tables in [ipp-ntfy] section 9.1
     (.Content of Machine Consumable Event Notifications.) except that
     each cell in the .Sends. column is a  .MUST..

     For an Event Notification for all Events, the Printer sends the
     following attributes.

9.1.2 Send-Notifications Response

The Notification Recipient MUST return (to the client which is the
Printer) the following sets of attributes as part of a Send-
Notifications response:

Every operation response contains the following REQUIRED parameters (see
[ipp-mod] section 3.1.1}:

     - a "version-number"
     - a "status-code"
     - the "request-id" that was supplied in the corresponding request


Group 1: Operation Attributes

  Status Message:
     As defined in [ipp-mod].

INTERNET-DRAFT   IPP: The INDP Notification Delivery MethodJuly 6, 2000


     The Notification Recipient can return any status codes defined in
     [ipp-mod] and section 10.1 that applies to all of the Event
     Notification Attribute groups. The following is a description of
     the important status codes:

       'successful-ok': the Notification Recipient received all of the
          Event Notification Attribute Groups and was expecting each of
          them.
       'successful-ok-ignored-notifications': the Notification
          Recipient was able to consume some, but not all of the Event
          Notification Attributes Groups sent. The Event Notification
          Attributes Groups with a .notify-status-code. attribute are
          the ones that were ignored or are to be canceled.
       'client-error-ignored-all-notifications': the Notification
          Recipient was unable to consume any of the Event Notification
          Attributes Groups sent. The Event Notification Attributes
          Groups with a .notify-status-code. attribute are the ones that
          were ignored or are to be canceled.

  Natural Language and Character Set:
     The "attributes-charset" and "attributes-natural-language"
     attributes as defined in [ipp-mod] section 3.1.4.1.


Group 2 to N: Notification Attributes

  These groups MUST be returned if and only if the "status-code"
  parameter returned in Group 1 is anything but the 'successful-ok'
  status code.

  "notification-status-code" (type2 enum)
     Indicates whether the Notification Recipient was able to consume
     the n-th Notification Report as follows:

     'successful-ok' - this Event Notification Attribute Group was
       consumed
     'client-error-not-found' - this Event Notification Attribute Group
       was not able to be consumed.  The Printer MUST cancel the
       Subscription and MUST NOT attempt to send any further Event
       Notifications from the associated Subscription object.
     'successful-ok-but-cancel-subscription' - the Event Notification
       Attribute Group was consumed, but the Notification Recipient
       wishes to cancel the Subscription object.  The Printer MUST
       cancel the Subscription and MUST NOT attempt to send any further
       Event Notifications from the associated Subscription object.

9.2  Notification Protocol URI Scheme


The INDP Notification Delivery Method uses the 'indp://' URI scheme in
the "notify-recipients" attribute in the Subscription object in order to
indicate the notification Delivery Method defined in this document.  The
remainder of the URI indicates the host and address of the Notification
Recipient that is to receive the Send-Notification operation.

10 Status Codes

This section lists status codes whose meaning have been extended and/or
defined for returning in Event Notification Attribute Groups as the
value of the "notification-status-code" operation attribute.  The code
values are allocated in the same space as the status codes in [ipp-mod].


10.1 Additional Status Codes


The following status codes are defined as extensions for Notification
and are returned as the value of the .status-code. parameter in the
Operation Attributes Group of a response (see [ipp-mod] section
3.1.6.1). Operations in this document can also return the status codes
defined in section 13 of [ipp-mod]. The .successful-ok. status code is
an example of such a status code.


10.1.1    successful-ok-ignored-notifications (0x0004)

The Notification Recipient was able to consume some, but not all, of the
Event Notifications Attributes Groups sent by the Printer in the Send-
Notifications request.  See section 9.1.2 for further details.


10.2 Status Codes returned in Event Notification Attributes Groups


This section contains values of the .notify-status-code. attribute that
the Notification Recipient returns in a Event Notification Attributes
Group in a response when the corresponding Event Notification Attributes
Group in the request:

  1. was not consumed OR

  2. was consumed, but the Notification Recipient wants to cancel the
     corresponding Subscription object

The following sections are ordered in decreasing order of importance of
the status-codes.


10.2.1    client-error-not-found (0x0406)

This status code is defined in [ipp-mod]. This document extends its
meaning and allows it to be returned in an Event Notification Attributes
Group of a response.

The Notification Recipient was unable to consume this Event Notification
Attributes Group because it was not expected.  See section 9.1.2 for
further details.

INTERNET-DRAFT   IPP: The INDP Notification Delivery MethodJuly 6, 2000


10.2.2    successful-ok-but-cancel-subscription (0x0006)

The Notification Recipient was able to consume this Event Notification
Attributes Group that the Printer sent, but wants the corresponding
Subscription object to be canceled none-the-less.  See section 9.1.2 for
further details.


11 Encoding and Transport

This section defines the encoding and transport used by the 'indp'
Delivery Method.


11.1 Encoding of the Operation Layer


The 'indp' Delivery Method uses the IPP operation layer encoding
described in [ipp-pro] and the following Event Notification Attributes
Group tag allocated by [ipp-ntfy]:

   Tag Value (Hex)   Meaning

   0x07              .event-notification-attributes-tag.



11.2 Encoding of Transport Layer


The 'indp' Notification Delivery Method uses the IPP transport layer
encoding described in [ipp-pro].

It is REQUIRED that an 'indp' Notification Recipient implementation
support HTTP over the IANA assigned Well Known Port assigned to the
'indp' Delivery Method as its default port by IANA (see section 12),
though a Notification Recipient implementation MAY support HTTP over
some other port as well.


12 IANA Considerations

The 'indp://' URL scheme for the 'indp' Delivery Method will be
registered with IANA.  IANA will assign a default port to use with the
'indp' Delivery Method.


13 Internationalization Considerations

When the client requests Human Consumable form by supplying the "notify-
text-format" operation attribute (see [ipp-ntfy]), the IPP Printer (or
any Notification Service that the IPP Printer might be configured to
use) supplies and localizes the text value of the "human-readable-
report" attribute in the Notification according to the charset and
natural language requested in the notification subscription.

INTERNET-DRAFT   IPP: The INDP Notification Delivery MethodJuly 6, 2000


14 Security Considerations

The IPP Model and Semantics document [ipp-mod] discusses high level
security requirements (Client Authentication, Server Authentication and
Operation Privacy). Client Authentication is the mechanism by which the
client proves its identity to the server in a secure manner. Server
Authentication is the mechanism by which the server proves its identity
to the client in a secure manner. Operation Privacy is defined as a
mechanism for protecting operations from eavesdropping.

The Notification Recipient can cancel unwanted Subscriptions created by
other parties without having to be the owner of the subscription by
returning the 'successful-ok-but-cancel-subscription' status code in the
Send-Notifications response returned to the Printer.

14.1 Security Conformance


Printers (client) MAY support Digest Authentication [rfc2617].  If
Digest Authentication is supported, then MD5 and MD5-sess MUST be
supported, but the Message Integrity feature NEED NOT be supported.

Notification Recipient (server) MAY support Digest Authentication
[rfc2617].  If Digest Authentication is supported, then MD5 and MD5-sess
MUST be supported, but the Message Integrity feature NEED NOT be
supported.

Notification Recipients MAY support TLS for client authentication,
server authentication and operation privacy. If a Notification Recipient
supports TLS, it MUST support the TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
cipher suite as mandated by RFC 2246 [rfc2246]. All other cipher suites
are OPTIONAL. Notification recipients MAY support Basic Authentication
(described in HTTP/1.1 [rfc2616]) for client authentication if the
channel is secure. TLS with the above mandated cipher suite can provide
such a secure channel.
