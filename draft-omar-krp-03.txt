RFC              KHALED Routing Protocol (KRP)       December 20, 2017



1.  Introduction


    - KHALED Routing Protocol (KRP) is an Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) that
      introduces a new way of routing IP packets from the source to the destination
      through different Autonomous Systems (ASs).
    - The enhancements that KRP adds are:

      a) Decreasing the BGP routing table.
      b) Enhancing the routing function.
      c) Enhancing the QoS.    

    - KRP shrinks the BGP routing table by more than 80%.
    - KRP makes separate links for different traffic class to enhance the QoS.
    - KRP is considered a replacement to BGP.
    - The Internet will be subdivided into logical regions or by the physical
      location of continents.
    - The routing process that KHALED Routing Protocol (KRP) uses is based on the
      KRP Region Number (RN), the KRP Autonomous System Number (ASN), Best Path Algorithm
      (AS Path) and the efforts made by the IGP within each AS.
    - The major difference between KRP and BGP is that KRP does not uses a large table
      with hundreds of thousands of entries (BGP Table) stored within each Internet router,
      instead of that, it uses a smarter way of routing based on the KRP RN, KRP ASN
      stored within each IP address, Best Path Algorithm (AS Path) and the efforts already
      being done by each IGP within an AS.

2. KHALED Routing Protocol (KRP)



    - KRP uses new terms that can be defined as follows:


    * Region Number (RN):


   - The 1st hex digit of the 2nd group of an IPv6 address determines on which RN this IPv6
     address is located.
   - The 1st octet of an IPv4 address determines on which RN this IPv4 address is located.
   - The table that will be used listing the Region Number (RN), the corresponding IPv6
     2nd group 1st hex digits and the IPv4 1st octet pool of numbers is called the
     Region Number Table (RNT) and is stored on every KRP router and is as follows:


     **********************************************************************************************
     *  Region Number  *  1st Hex Digit of the 2nd IPv6 Group   *  1st IPv4 Octet Decimal Digits  * 
     **********************************************************************************************  
     *        1        *             0 - 5 - A - F              *            ARIN Pool            *        
     **********************************************************************************************  
     *        2        *             1 - 6 - B                  *           LACNIC Pool           *        
     **********************************************************************************************  
     *        3        *             2 - 7 - C                  *       RIPE NCC/APNIC Pool       *        
     **********************************************************************************************  
     *        4        *             3 - 8 - D                  *           AFRINIC Pool          *        
     **********************************************************************************************  
     *        5        *             4 - 9 - E                  *            APNIC Pool           *

RFC              KHALED Routing Protocol (KRP)       December 20, 2017



    * Regional Boarder Router (RBR) ==> A router in a region that has
                                        at least one interface connected
                                        to a router's interface in another
                                        region.


    * Regional Router (RR) ==> - A router in a region and has all interfaces
                                 connected to other routers in the same
                                 region.

                               - A router in a local AS that has at least
                                 one interface connected to a different AS.
                                

    * Local KRP AS Router (LKAR) ==> A router in an AS that has all interfaces
                                     connected to other routers in the same AS.



   - Each RBR and RR is configured with a Region Number (RN) that identifies
     in which region that router is located. 
   - All RBRs and RRs interfaces will be assigned by default to the configured
     Region Number (RN).
   
   - The two connected KRP routers exchange their RNs: 

       1) If they are the same, the two KRP routers are RRs.
       2) If they are different, the two KRP routers are RBRs.

  
   - The two connected KRP routers exchange their KRP ASNs:

       1) If they are the same, the two KRP routers are LKARs.
       2) If they are different, the two KRP routers are RRs.  

   
   Note:

      - For ISPs and Enterprises, the RN and KRP ASN are configured
        manually on every KRP router.

      - For Enterprises, the RN and KRP ASN must be stored on every
        assigned GUA (in case of IPv6) and on every public IP address
        (in case of IPv4).




3. KRP Forwarding Mechanism



   - The KRP ASN is represented as follows:

     a) The 2nd two groups of an IPv6 address are represented as follows:

                  xxxx|yyyy|yyyy|yyyy:yyyy|yyyy|yyyy|yyyy     Binary Format
                                   
                                 XYYY.YYYY                 Hexadecimal Format

       where X hex digit is associated with a specific Region Number (RN).
       and XYYY.YYYY hex digits represents the KRP Autonomous System Number (ASN).



     b) All octets of an IPv4 address is represented as follows:

                      xxxxxxxx.yyyyyyyy.yyyyyyyy.yyyyyyyy    Binary Format

                                   XXYY.YYYY              Hexadecimal Format

      where XX hex digits are associated with a specific Region Number (RN).
      and XXYY.YYYY hex digits represents the KRP Autonomous System Number (ASN).

     Note:- - The Region Number (RN) is unique for every region.
            - The KRP ASN must be unique for every AS.
            - For IPv4, the 4 octets are represented in decimal in the IPv4 address
              itself, but the KRP ASN is represented in 8 hexadecimal digits.
            - For IPv4, Enterprises can be assigned more than one KRP ASN.



    - There are 3 types of tables, 2 RBR messages and 1 RR message that KRP uses for
      forwarding a packet:


     a) KRP router Regional Table (RT):


    - Each RBR and RR creates its own Regional Table (RT).
    - The Regional Table (RT) is as follows:


     **********************************************************************
     * Local RN * Remote RN * Traffic Class * Local KRP ASN * RBR KRP ASN * 
     **********************************************************************  
     *          *           *               *               *             *
     **********************************************************************
