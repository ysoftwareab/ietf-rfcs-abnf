                     Non-Normative Synonyms in RFCs
                  draft-hansen-nonkeywords-non2119-04

Abstract

   Specifications in RFCs contain normative keywords, as defined in RFC
   2119, to signify requirements, permission or prohibitions.  These
   include MUST, SHOULD and MAY, which are commonly recorded in all
   CAPITALS (but need not be).  The RFC 2119 words are sometimes also
   used with non-normative meaning; this non-normative usage can be
   confusing and it is better to restrict the RFC 2119 words to be used
   solely as normative directives.

   Happily, natural languages permit variation in phrasing, so that
   meaning can be retained without use of this otherwise-normative
   vocabulary.  For such situations, this document provides some
   alternatives to the normative vocabulary of RFC 2119.

Status of This Memo

1.  Words That Do Double Duty

   To indicate a degree of requirement, permission or prohibition for an
   aspect of a specification, words such as MUST, SHOULD and MAY are
   defined as normative vocabulary in the formal aspects of the RFC
   series [RFC2119].  However it is also natural to use them non-
   normatively, in a narrative fashion.  Even when this carries no
   obvious potential confusion, such as within RFCs that do not invoke
   the conventions of RFC 2119, non-normative use of these words in RFCs
   invites confusion for the reader; their normative meaning is too
   deeply ingrained in the culture of the RFC series.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are meant to reference their occurrence in [RFC2119].  The
   words are not used normatively here.

   Fortunately, there are other words readily available, in lieu of the
   RFC 2119 words, when a non-normative meaning is intended.  These
   alternatives, or their equivalents, can be used instead of the
   normatively-encumbered vocabulary.

   |             | an action                        | is permitted to  |
   +-------------+----------------------------------+------------------+

   Because the word "NOT" (or "not") only takes on a special meaning
   when it is combined with one of the RFC 2119 normative words, the
   word "not" can be freely used with any of the above suggestions and
   not be taken to have any separate RFC 2119 connotation.  For example,
   "ought not" is non-normative, while "should not" and "SHOULD NOT"
   might be normative in the RFC 2119 sense.

   By using these alternative wordings, authors of RFCs and internet
   drafts can avoid the possibility of vocabulary (that is sometimes
   used normatively) being misinterpreted.

   Note that the above list of synonyms is not meant to be exhaustive;
   other non-RFC-2119-normative words can, of course, also be used at
   the author's discretion.

   Authors who follow these guidelines might want to incorporate a
   declaration about usage at the beginning of their document.

   [Note to RFC Editor: please remove this paragraph before
   publication.]  This document can be discussed on the ietf@ietf.org
   mailing list.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA considerations.

4.  Security Considerations

   The RFC 2119 terms are frequently used to specify behavior with
   security implications.  The effects on security of changing something
   from a "MUST" to a "needs to", or vice versa, can be very subtle, as
   one can have normative meaning and the other does not.  Document
   authors need to take the time to consider the effects of using non-
   normative verbiage as specified in this document instead of the
   normative verbiage from RFC 2119.
