Internet-Draft              URI Lists in SIP               November 2003


1. Introduction

   The need for exploders in SIP is described in [5]. Mechanisms to
   invoke exploders in SIP need to meet the requirements listed there.

   UAs need to have a means to provide application servers with a set of
   URIs for certain services. A UA creating a conference needs to
   provide the conference server with the participants. A UA requesting
   presence information from a set of users needs to provide the
   resource list server with the URIs of the users that belong to the
   list.

   These lists are typically configured using out-of-band methods. For
   instance, a UA can use XCAP [4] to create a list of URIs and to
   associate this list with a SIP URI. It can, then, send a SIP request
   (an INVITE or a SUBSCRIBE in our previous examples) to that SIP URI.

   Nevertheless, there is a need to create lists of URIs in an ad-hoc
   way and send them directly in a SIP message. We use Content-ID URLs
   [2] and XCAP resource lists (draft-ietf-simple-xcap-list-usage)
   encoded in MIME bodies [3] for that purpose. We also define a SIP and
   a SIPS header field parameter called "list".

2. Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

3. The SIP and SIPS URI List Parameter

   We define the "list" parameter for SIP and SIPS URIs. It MUST contain
   a URI that points to an XCAP resource list. Its ABNF is:

   list-param = "list=" absoluteURI

   The following is an example of a SIP URI with a list parameter
   pointing to a body part using a Content-ID URL:

   sip:group@example.com;list=cid:cn35t8jf02@example.com

   The following is an example of a SIP URI with a list parameter
   pointing to an external URI:

   sip:group@example.com;list=http://xcap.example.com/lists/mylist.xml

Internet-Draft              URI Lists in SIP               November 2003


4. Examples

   This section shows how to use the list parameter to create an ad-hoc
   conference and to subscribe to the presence information to a set of
   users.

4.1 Ad-Hoc Conference

   Carol creates an ad-hoc conference by sending the INVITE request
   shown in Figure 1. The list parameter in the Request-URI points to a
   MIME body that carries the list of participants.

   for the conference in its Contact header field. If the UA wants to

   sub-encode the body as a MIME part or we define that header field in
   SIP
