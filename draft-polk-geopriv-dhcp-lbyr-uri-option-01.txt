Abstract

   This document creates a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
   Option for the Location-by-Reference (LbyR) Uniform Resource 
   Identifier (URI) of an endpoint.  For example, an endpoint can be a 
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent, i.e., a phone.  This 
   LbyR URI can be included in a UA's messages to inform other nodes of
   that UA's geographic location, once the URI is dereferenced by a 
   Location Recipient.

1.  Introduction

   This document creates a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
   Option for delivery of a client's Location-by-Reference (LbyR) 
   Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).  For example, a client can be a 
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent (UA) [RFC3261], i.e., a
   phone.  This LbyR URI can be included in one UA's messages to 
   informing those remote devices of that UA's geographic location, 
   once the URI is dereferenced by a Location Recipient [ID-SIP-LOC]. A
   Location Recipient is a device that has received location from 
   another device.  If this location is delivered by a URI, the URI has
   to be dereferenced to learn the remote device's geographic location.
   Dereferencing can be done in SIP by use of the SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY 
   Methods [RFC3265] to either a sip:, sips: or pres: scheme URI.

   Endpoints will require their geographic location for a growing 
   number of services.  A popular use-case currently is for emergency 
   services, in which SIP requires its location to be placed in a SIP 
   INVITE request message towards a public safety answering point 
   (PSAP).  The reason for this is twofold:

   o An emergency services SIP request must be routed/retargeted to the
     appropriate PSAP that is local to where the PSAP is.

   o The first responders require the UA's location in order to know 
     where to go to render aid to the caller.

   There are other use-cases, such as calling the appropriate Pizza Hut
   without having to look up which store is closest.  A UA knowing its
   location can call a main/national/international Pizza Hut number or 
   address and let the UA's location tell Pizza Hut enough information
   to have them route/retarget the SIP request to the appropriate store
   within the Pizza Hut organization to deliver the pizza to the

   caller.

   A problem exists within existing RFCs that provide location to the 
   UA, [RFC3825] and [RFC4776], that location has to be updated every 
   time a UA moves.  This does not scale in certain 
   networks/environments, such as enterprise networks or service 
   provider networks with mobile endpoints.  An 802.11 based access 
   network is an example of this.  This also might not scale in mobile 
   residential networks in which the UA is hopping between more than 
   one network attachment point, perhaps as a person walks with their 
   UA down a neighborhood street or apartment complex. 

   If the UA were provided a URI reference to retain and hand out when
   it wants to convey its location, one that would not change as the 
   UAC's location changes, scaling issues would be significantly 
   reduced.  This delivery of an indirect location has the added 
   benefit of not using up valuable or limited bandwidth to the UA 
   with the constant updates.  A service provider would merely update 
   what location is at the URI the UA already has, with this new DHCP
   Option.

   In enterprise networks, a URI can be assigned to individual Ethernet
   ports; meaning whatever is attached to a particular port will get 
   the same URI because that device is at a known location.  This 
   scenario applies to 802.11 Access Points (AP), in which the AP's 
   location is what's known.  The same URI can be given to all devices 
   attached to the same AP.  Just as with residential router/gateways, 
   which can be wired or wireless, in which all devices understanding 
   this Option will be giving the location of the residence. The Option
   also benefits from the URI not needing identity information to still
   be useful.

   APs that triangulate can also have a individual URI downloaded to 
   each endpoint with this Option, for the endpoint to hand out 
   whenever it is configured to in whatever protocol it is capable of. 
   This Option can be useful in WiMAX connected endpoints or IP 
   cellular endpoints.  The Location URI Option can be configured as a 
   client if it is a router, such as a residential home gateway, with 
   the ability to communicate to downstream endpoints as a server. 

   This document IANA registers the new DHC Option for a Location URI.

2.  DHC Location URI Elements

   DHCP is a binary Protocol; URIs are alphanumeric (text) based.  
   There is one byte per URI character.

   [Editor's question: should UTF-8 vs. UTF-16 be accounted for?]

   The Location URI Option format is as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |   Code XXX    | Option Length |        Location URI           |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                     Location URI (cont'd)                     |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    /                            ....                               \
    \                            ....                               /
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                     Location URI (cont'd)                     +
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


2.1.  Elements of the Location Configuration Information

   Code XXX:      The code for this DHCP option.

   Option Length: The length of this option variable.

   Location URI:  The Location URI

   There are no additional fields within this Option, as the value of 
   the URI is contained within the URI field, including all URI 
   parameters and (what could become another protocol's) header 
   parameters.


3. DHC Option Operation

   The [RFC3046] RAIO MUST be utilized to provide the appropriate 
   indication to the DHCP Server where this DISCOVER or REQUEST message
   came from, in order to supply the correct response.

   Caution SHOULD always be used involving the creation of large 
   Options, meaning that this Option MAY need to be in its own INFORM, 
   OPTION or ACK message.

   It is RECOMMENDED to avoid building URIs, with any parameters, 
   larger than what a single DHCP response can be.  However, if a 
   message is larger than 255 bytes, concatenation is allowed to be 
   used [RFC3396].

Internet-Draft        Geopriv DHCP LbyR URI Option            July 2007

   Per [RFC2131], subsequent LbyR URI Options, which are 
   non-concatenated, overwrite the previous value.

   LbyR URIs SHOULD NOT reveal identity information of the user of the 
   device, since DHCP is a cleartext delivery protocol. 

   [Editor's question: can the above SHOULD NOT be a MUST NOT?] 


3.1 Architectural Assumptions

   The following assumptions have been made for use of this URI Option 
   for a client to learn it's location URI (in no particular order):

   o  The DHCP Server communicates with the Location Information Server
      (LIS), which likely stores the location information for URIs.  
      This exchange can be any number of protocols (SOAP, HTTP, FTP,
      SIP, etc) on a per request-basis/log-on, or in bulk.

   o  A URI is assigned to a Ethernet Switch, router or home gateway 
      port - such that the location does not change without 
      administrative controls.  This allows any device to attach to the
      network from a particular port to have the same location URI 
      given to them, because that device is in the same location.

   o  The population of the database of Ethernet Switch, router or home
      gateway port, in the LIS is done administratively, and outside 
      the scope of this document.

   o  A DHCP Server is not expected to deliver location URIs with this 
      option outside of the DHCP Server's policy domain.  Most likely 
      this is within a company's network, or a region of a network for 
      SPs.

   o  Any user control (what Geopriv calls a 'rulemaker') for the 
      parameters and profile options a Location-Object will have is out
      of scope of this document, by assumed to take place via something
      such as a web interface between the user and the LIS (direct or 
      indirect).

   o  Any user attempting to gain access to the information at this URI
      will be challenged by the server for credentials and permissions.

Internet-Draft        Geopriv DHCP LbyR URI Option            July 2007

   Location URI option, defined in Section 2.0 of this document.

   Any additional Location URI parameters to be defined for use via 
   this DHC Option MUST be done through a Standards Track RFC.


6.  Security Considerations

   Where critical decisions might be based on the value of this 
   LbyR URI option, DHCP authentication in [RFC3118] SHOULD be used to 
   protect the integrity of the DHCP options.

   Since there is no privacy protection for DHCP messages, an 
   eavesdropper who can monitor the link between the DHCP server and 
   requesting client can discover this LbyR URI.  Other than capturing 
   the URI, the location of the client benefits from the protection of 
   whatever server challenge mechanisms are available and configured 
   for any device attempting access of the location record that the
   URI.

   LbyR URIs need to reduce or eliminate client identity information 
   within the URI itself, because DHCP is a cleartext delivery 
   protocol.

   When implementing a DHC server that will serve clients across an 
   uncontrolled network, one should consider the potential security 
   risks therein.
