1.  Introduction

   In syndication document formats such as Atom [I-D.ietf-atompub-
   format] and RSS ([http://purl.org/rss/1.0/spec][http://
   blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss]), the order of entries as presented
   in the list is typically insignificant.  This presents a challenge
   when the list of entries is intended to represent an ordered list of
   elements.  This document specifies a mechanism that allows feed
   publishers to indicate whether or not the order of entries within a
   feed is should be considered to be significant.  Although it refers
   to Atom normatively, the mechanism described herein can be used with
   similar syndication formats, such as the various flavors of RSS.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119], as
   scoped to those conformance targets.

   In this specification, "entry" refers to an atom:entry element or
   similar construct from other syndication formats (e.g., RSS) that are
   contained within a feed.

   In this specification, "feed" refers to an Atom Feed Document or
   similar syndication format (e.g., RSS) that contains a collection of
   entries.

   In this specification, "head section" refers to the children of a
   feed document's document-wide metadata container; e.g., the child
   elements of the atom:feed element in an Atom Feed Document.

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following
   namespace prefix for the indicated namespace URI;
   "i": "http://purl.org/syndication/index/1.0"

   This specification uses terms from the XML Infoset [W3C.REC-xml-
   infoset-20040204].  However, this specification uses a shorthand; the
   phrase "Information Item" is omitted when naming Element Information
   Items.  Therefore, when this specification uses the term "element,"
   it is referring to an Element Information Item in Infoset terms.

3.  The 'i:ordered' Element

   The i:ordered element is used to indicate that the order of entries
   within a feed SHOULD be considered significant.  It MUST NOT occur
   more than once in a feed's head section.  The element's value MUST be

   empty.

   For example,
     <i:ordered />

   The i:ordered element MAY have a sort attribute whose value indicates
   the default sort order of entries.  The attribute's value MUST be
   either "descending" indicating a last-to-first sort order or
   "ascending" indicating an first-to-last sort order.  If the sort
   attribute is omitted, a value of "ascending" is assumed.  The value
   of the sort attribute is case insensitive.

   For example,
     <i:ordered sort="descending" />

   The i:ordered element MUST NOT contain any other attributes.

4.  Presenting Ordering Entries

   When presented with a feed whose head section contains an i:ordered
   element, a consumer MAY present the entries in either an ascending or
   descending order based on the position of the entry within the feed
   and the value of the i:ordered element's sort attribute if present
   (ascending order if not).

   For example,

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
           xmlns:i="http://purl.org/syndication/index/1.0">
       ...
       <i:ordered sort="descending" />

       <entry>
         <id>tag:entry:1</id>
         ...
       </entry>

       <entry>
         <id>tag:entry:2</id>
         ...
       </entry>

       <entry>
         <id>tag:entry:3</id>
         ...
       </entry>
     </feed>

   When presented, the entries from the example feed SHOULD be
   displayed, by default, in descending order:

     1. tag:entry:3
     2. tag:entry:2
     3. tag:entry:1

   Consumers are not required to present entries in the order
   established by the i:ordered element.

5.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations introduced by this
   specification.
