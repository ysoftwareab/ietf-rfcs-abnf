        known also as Transparent LAN services (TLS) to a large number 
        of customers attached to low-cost Ethernet provider devices. 
        These devices specialized mostly for Ethernet based functions 
        (e.g., MAC learning, etc) may not have adequate resources and 
        functions compared to provider devices offering large scale 
        layer-2 or layer-3 VPN services. Consider also the case where 
        those devices are themselves attached to either switched 
        Ethernet networks or through uplinks to other provider edge 
        devices, which are attached to a core IP/MPLS network 
        infrastructure. The problem is how to provide a network-based 
        VPLS solution that scales to a large number of VPLSs, each with 
        a large number of customer ports while at the same time the 
        solution should be cost-effective at service provider network-
        edges. This draft introduces the "Logical PE" architecture to 
        effectively address this problem.

     2. Introduction 
         
        Consider a common network scenario in the metro area where the 
        service provider offers Virtual Private LAN services (VPLS) 
        known also as Transparent LAN services (TLS) to a large number 
        of customers attached to low-cost Ethernet provider devices. 
        These devices specialized mostly for Ethernet based functions 
        (e.g., MAC learning, etc) may not have adequate resources and 
        functions compared to provider devices offering large scale 
        layer-2 or layer-3 VPN services. Consider also the case where 
        those devices are themselves attached to either switched 
        Ethernet networks or through uplinks to other provider edge 
        devices, which are attached to a core IP/MPLS network 
        infrastructure. The problem is how to provide a network-based 
        VPLS solution that scales to a large number of VPLSs each with a 
        large number of customer ports while at the same time the 
        solution should be cost-effective at service provider network-
        edges. This draft introduces the "Logical PE" architecture to 
        effectively address this problem. 
         
        Architecting a scalable network based VPLS solution faces 
        challenges related to the nature of the Ethernet technology 
        itself and the network-based VPN mechanisms used. Most of 
        existing VPLS solutions attempt to address the VPLS architecture 
        within a problem space similar to the layer-3 and point-to-point 
        layer-2 VPNs. Although the layer-3/2 VPN problem space is indeed 
        part of the VPLS problem space, it doesn't fully meet all the 
        possible scaling characteristics and common VPLS network 
        deployment scenarios. This section illustrates the nature of 
        VPLS service/architecture, network based VPN technologies with 
        VPLS, VPLS architecture models and functions.

     2.1 What is a VPLS Service? 
         
        Initially introduced in [RFC-2764], a Virtual Private LAN 
        service (VPLS) is a VPN service, which emulates a LAN segment 
        using IP based facilities. A VPLS can be used to provide what 
        is known as a Transparent LAN Service (TLS) used to 
        interconnect multiple customer edge devices (CEs) (e.g., 
        bridges, router, routing switch) across a shared Ethernet and 
        IP/MPLS service provider network infrastructure. The primary 
        benefits of a VPLS are complete protocol transparency, which 
        are important both for multiprotocol transport and for 
        regulatory reasons in particular service provider contexts. 
      
        From an end-user's perspective, a VPLS ties geographically 
        separate sites together as if they share a common LAN segment. 
        A VPLS network is built by attaching customer LAN equipment 
        into the provider Ethernet ports, and interconnecting them to 
        other provider customer facing ports across the service 
        provider network. The end user does not need to know exactly 
        how the packets are delivered only that they are delivered 
        unmodified to the proper sites. Multiple VPLS services can be 
        provided on a single service provider network. A provider edge 
        device (PE) can support multiple VPLS services. 
      
         
     2.2 VPLS Architecture and Ethernet Scaling Issues 
         
        This sections describes the main issues related to Ethernet 
        technology in the VPN space: 
         
        o Customer Separation on a shared infrastructure 
         
        Ethernet was originally designed as an Enterprise Local Area 
        Network where support for customer separation is not a 
        requirement. As Ethernet deployment grew Enterprise customers 
        sought ways of separating different departments traffic on 
        single Ethernet based infrastructure. An enhancement to the 
        original standard provided an answer with the addition of 
        802.1Q VLAN(s) that allow for separate broadcast domains on the 
        one physical network. In its standard form 802.1Q VLAN(s) 
        identifiers can provide up to 4,096 unique VLANs and many 
        vendors have allowed for more than one 802.1Q identifier 
        (stacked VLANs) in a single packet thus increasing the number 
        of VLANs supported.  
         
        For service providers who may have many thousands of customers 
        this approach will not meet scaling objectives when used in a 
        network environment with a large number of VPLSs along with a 
        large number of other VPN services.  
         
        o MAC and VLAN Explosion 
         
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.            May 2002                       [Page 4] 
             draft-ouldbrahim-l2vpn-lpe-00.txt       November 2001 
      
      
        The Ethernet MAC address is the unique global identifier for an 
        Ethernet device. The MAC address is used to identify a specific 
        device and is stored in Ethernet switches to identify the 
        location of a device.  In a large network with many devices the 
        number of MAC addresses that need to be stored in an Ethernet 
        switch can be in the tens of thousands. The need to store all 
        device addresses on network nodes is a significant scaling and 
        reliability issue and is known as the MAC explosion issue.  
         
        A MAC "explosion" is a significant scaling issue in a Service 
        Provider's network. As traffic migrates to the Core of the 
        network, a large number of MAC addresses need to be learned. 
        This approach is essentially unmanageable in situations where a 
        failure of network devices impacts all devices whose addresses 
        are stored on that device. 
         
        A similar problem occurs with 802.1Q VLAN identifiers. Each 
        customer may have many VLAN identifiers, which can overlap with 
        other customers.  Even with VLAN stacking the number of VLANs 
        lead to significant complexity in network design and 
        operational issues that limit the scale of the network. 
         
        A VPLS solution must aim towards isolating the MAC and VLAN 
        relevance to only the provider edge devices. All customer MAC 
        addresses and VLAN identifiers are stored in edge devices and 
        have only local significance. The intermediate network elements 
        are not required to be aware of MAC customer addresses or VLAN. 
         
         
        o Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Issues 
         
        The STP was designed to eliminate loops in Ethernet networks to 
        ensure that there was always a path to every device on the 
        network.  It creates two major limitations when building a 
        scalable VPLS solution on conventional PEs. Firstly, the STP 
        builds a "tree" structure in the network that block the 
        redundant links that create loops. This passive redundancy 
        wastes available bandwidth. Second, the STP is a convergence 
        type algorithm and in most cases requires an amount of time to 
        re-compute and converge after a network failure. During this 
        time the STP domain is not operational and no traffic is 
        forwarded. To overcome this problem, a VPLS solution should aim 
        towards building a fully redundant active network that utilizes 
        all available bandwidth and resources and where recovery from 
        failure occurs in fractions of a second.  
         
        o Traffic Engineering 
         
        When Ethernet was originally designed and to maintain 
        simplicity of the technology, traffic engineering was not a 
        significant requirement in enterprise Ethernet networks. With 
        the introduction of VLANs it was possible to define multiple 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.            May 2002                       [Page 5] 
             draft-ouldbrahim-l2vpn-lpe-00.txt       November 2001 
      
      
        STP domains in a single network. However, this approach does 
        not alleviate the fundamental limitations of STP. With Ethernet 
        and the STP network, traffic tends to migrate toward the core 
        of the network resulting in hot spots in some parts of the 
        network and under utilization in others. This is inefficient 
        and limits network scalability. Using traffic engineering 
        capabilities of MPLS for example in an IP based network, and 
        bundling bandwidth reservation to the logical tunnels should be 
        a design goal for a scalable network-based VPLS solution. 
         
         
     2.3 Network-based VPNs and VPLS Service 
         
     2.3.1 L2VPN Architectures 
         
        Layer-2 VPN extends the concept of traditional layer-2 circuits 
        to accommodate VPN constructs like membership, auto-discovery, 
        tunneling, and topology discovery. Two layer-2 VPN architectures 
        [L2VPN-ROSEN], [L2VPN-KOMP] are being proposed within provider 
        provisioned VPNs working group. Both are based on [MARTINI-
        ENCAPS] for encapsulating layer-2 frames and they differ in the 
        way l2vpn services are built and auto-discovered and whether 
        signaling of l2vpn information (i.e., encapsulation) is 
        decoupled from the auto-discovery scheme.[L2VPN-ROSEN] is based 
        on [MARTINI-TRANSP] as a signaling scheme to establish layer-2 
        circuits. Further improvement to the scheme, [ROSEN-SIG] 
        introduced the concept of single sided signaling to accommodate 
        a VPLS service where endpoint need not have apriori knowledge of 
        each other. [L2VPN-KOMP] build the l2vpn through site indexation 
        scheme. Although these two architectures are still under 
        development within PPVPN WG, this document describes how logical 
        PE architecture can be adapted to a core network running either 
        [MARTINI-TRANSP] based l2vpn solution, or [L2VPN-KOMP] 
        architecture or running both types of architectures.  
         
     2.3.2 L2VPN Architectures and VPLS 
         
        An important objective of existing Provider Provisioned network-
        based VPN solutions is to address VPN service and provider 
        network scalability requirements [PPVPN-REQ], [PPVPN-FRAME]. The 
        mechanisms developed within these solutions (e.g., [BGP-AD]) can 
        greatly benefit scaling VPLS architectures. VPN Scalability is 
        addressed mostly from aggregation and auto-discovery mechanisms. 
        Aggregation offers the ability to multiplex multiple VPNs over 
        shared network pipes. Auto-discovery provides the ability to 
        dynamically discover the VPN members and hence simplifies 
        service provisioning within the network (e.g., single ended 
        provisioning). 
         
        However, most of these network-based VPNs solutions and 
        techniques have been applied to a network model with the 
        assumption that the provider edge devices have all equal weight 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.            May 2002                       [Page 6] 
             draft-ouldbrahim-l2vpn-lpe-00.txt       November 2001 
      
      
        and are assumed to scale to a large number of VPNs. An Ethernet 
        VPLS based solution is required to meet the scaling requirement 
        where the PEs facing customer devices need to support a large 
        number of VPLS services where each VPLS has a large number of 
        ports attached to it. Furthermore, the PEs may also be used to 
        provide other VPN services (like layer-3 VPNs or point to point 
        L2VPNs). Scaling the number of VPLSs and port density on the PE 
        at the same time balancing the cost across provider edge devices 
        should be a main design goal for any VPLS solution.  
         
         
     2.4 VPLS and Logical PE Approach 
         
        One way of achieving both scaling and cost objectives is to 
        distribute some of the VPLS and VPN functions like MAC learning, 
        auto-discovery and aggregation among low-cost Ethernet based 
        provider edge devices (facing customer devices) and high 
        capacity core provider edge devices (attached to service 
        provider core network). A service provider may want to use a 
        "logical PE" function based on association between PE-facing 
        customer ports, called "PE-Edges", and core provider edge 
        devices, labeled as "PE-Core". Another objective of the logical 
        PE approach besides scaling is to be able to fit nicely with all 
        existing VPN technologies supported on the service provider 
        network [VPN-VR], [VPN-RFC2545bis], [L2VPN-KOMP], [L2VPN-ROSEN], 
        [OVPN].   
         
     2.5 VPLS Architecture Functions and VPLS Models 
         
        This sections describes the basic functions in a VPLS solution 
        and describes VPLS architecture models. 
         
     2.5.1 VPLS/L2VPN Reference Model 
         
        The VPLS network reference model follows the model described in 
        [PPVPN-REQ] and [VPLS-REQ]. A service provider may offer VPLS 
        services where a customer edge device (CE), which can be a 
        layer 2 Ethernet switch, a server, a router, a routing switch 
        or an Ethernet bridge is attached to a service provider edge 
        device. PEs are connected to internal provider devices (P) 
        which are considered VPLS unaware. This reference model is 
        similar to existing layer-3 and point-to-point reference 
        models. 
         
         
     2.5.2 VPLS Main Functions 
         
        A VPLS service should provide a set of functions, which mostly 
        are: 
         
        o MAC Learning

        MAC learning deals with the case where an Ethernet frame, 
        received from customer let say CE1, arrives at the ingress PE1 
        with a source MAC address A and a destination MAC address B. B 
        is not an entry in PE1 address look-up table. Mechanisms like 
        multicast, flooding can be used to inform each VPLS member PE 
        device of the unknown destination address frame, and eventually 
        the packet is received by B. Source MAC learning will be 
        accomplished by storing the source information with its route 
        (i.e., PE/tunnel) at each PE member of the VPLS. One mechanism 
        is to bound the service tunnel (e.g., VC Label in [MARTINI-
        TRANSP]) with the source MAC address. Therefore future lookup 
        on a packet received by the PE having the learned MAC 
        destination address will produce the egress tunnels that can be 
        used to forward the packet to the proper egress PE device.  
          
        o Broadcast and Multicast Capability 
         
        A VPLS needs to have a broadcast capability.  This is needed 
        both for broadcast frames, and for link layer packet flooding, 
        where a unicast frame is flooded because the path to the 
        destination link layer address is unknown.   
         
        o Tunneling 
         
        Like any VPN technology, VPLS solution has to provide 
        mechanisms by which customer traffic is separated. VPLS traffic 
        can be tunneled using tunneling mechanism such as Ethernet, GRE, 
        L2TP, MPLS, IPSec. 
         
        o VPLS Membership Determination 
         
        VPLS membership is analogous to that of layer-3 and layer-2 
        VPNs. It generally requires only knowledge of the local VPN 
        link assignments at any given VPLS edge node, and the identity 
        of, or route to, the other edge nodes in the VPLS.  A common 
        mechanism to associate a customer facing port at the PE level 
        to the VPLS is to associate a VPN membership scheme to the VPLS 
        and any port member of a given VPLS will be assigned the same 
        VPN membership ID. Depending on the VPLS architecture, one 
        common VPN membership scheme is to use the VPN-IDs format [RFC-
        2685].  
         
         
        o VPLS Topology and Loop Prevention 
         
        The topology of the VPLS could be manipulated by controlling 
        the configuration of peer nodes at each VPLS edge node combined 
        with an auto-discovery mechanism. In order to preclude the need 
        for traffic between two VPLS nodes to transit through another 
        VPLS node, which would then require the use of the Spanning 
        Tree protocol, fully mesh VPLS topology between PEs can be 
        used.

        o VPLS Auto-Discovery 
         
        Auto-discovery function (e.g., [BGP-AD]) is necessary for any 
        network-based VPNs in order to meet network scalability 
        requirements. VPLS architectures should support an automatic 
        mechanism that allows a particular VPLS to automatically 
        discover the VPLS members configured on a given PE. It may 
        happen that the auto-discovery mechanism extends to also 
        provide information such as encapsulation scheme to be used to 
        forward private frames across the tunnels (e.g., [KOMP-L2VPN]). 
         
         
     2.5.3 VPLS Model: Full Mesh Point-to-Point Circuits   
         
        The Full Mesh Point-to-Point VPLS model suggests that PE 
        Ethernet ports member of a VPLS are connected in a fully mesh 
        topology across the service provider network. The PE has the 
        functionality to receive frames from the attached CEs and make 
        a decision to what egress tunnel the frame should be forwarded. 
        MAC learning is achieved through the data plane through 
        broadcast/flooding on each per VPLS circuit  (within the VPLS 
        domain). When MPLS is used as the tunneling mechanism, bi-
        directional LSPs need to be established between each VPLS 
        endpoint. 
      
     2.5.4 Virtual Bridge/Switch Model  
      
        The virtual bridge/switch model is similar to layer-3 VPN 
        virtual router/VRF models except that each VPLS edge node 
        implements link layer forwarding rather than network layer 
        forwarding. Virtual bridge/switches are connected through 
        point-to-point private tunnels. As such, most of the layer-3 
        VPN tunneling and configuration mechanisms discussed in [PPVPN-
        FRAME] can also be used for virtual switches, with the 
        appropriate changes to accommodate link layer, rather than 
        network layer, packets and addressing information.  
      
     2.5.5 Virtual Switch with Full Mesh Point-to-Point Model 
         
        It is possible to combine a virtual switch model with a full 
        mesh point-to-point tunnels. One approach is to use virtual 
        switch model based on VPLS membership for broadcast, user 
        unknown, and multicast, and full-mesh for known Unicast packet.  
         
     3. Logical PE Architecture 
         
        This section describes the LPE architecture with its related 
        building blocks and functions. 
         
     3.1 VPLS LPE Reference Model 
         
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.            May 2002                       [Page 9]

        The logical PE architecture addresses network scenarios when 
        PEs facing customer devices is connected to some switched 
        Ethernet transport networks or uplinks attached to other PEs 
        which themselves are attached to a core network infrastructure. 
        In the example illustrated in figure 1, from a conceptual view 
        PEs facing customer equipment (and not attached to the core 
        network) combined with PE attached to the core network 
        represent from a conceptual view a "logical PE" construct where 
        many VPLSs along with other layer-2 and layer-3 VPN services 
        are attached to it.

                       Figure 1: Example of VPLS service 
      
        To highlight the case described in figure 1, we label each PE 
        within the network as a PE-Edge or PE-Core depending if the PE 
        is attached to the core network or not (and depending if there 
        is a functional relationship between the PE-Edge and the PE-
        Core). PEs who do not participate in these schemes are not 
        labeled. This model extends the previous L2VPN model described 
        in the section 2.5.1. Using figure 1, PE1, PE7, PE5, PE6 can be 
        labeled PE-Edges while PE2, PE3, PE4, and PE8 are labeled PE-
        Cores. 
         
        An example of logical PEs is shown in figure 2 and 3.

              Figure 3: Network reference using using logical PEs 
         
         
        Within the LPE reference model, a CE can be attached to one or 
        more than one PE-Edges. Most likely PE-Cores are highly 
        scalable routers/Ethernet switches (with IP/MPLS based 
        capabilities). PE-Cores like any other PEs can provide VPLS, 
        layer-2, and layer-3 VPN services.  
         
        PE-Core is associated with only one logical PE. An LPE may 
        contain more than one method of tunneling or switching 
        mechanism. A single LPE alone may even implement a separate

        low-scale L2VPN. PE-Edge is associated with only one logical 
        PE. Logical PE expresses the relationship between PE-Edge 
        devices and PE-Core devices. Note that a PE core can act as any 
        conventional PE providing VPN services. 
         
        Logical PE concept can be used in situations requiring high 
        scalability in terms of number of VPLSs and port density while 
        aiming towards reusing low-cost PE devices. LPE can also be 
        used in situations where the provider PEs don't have equal 
        weight with respect to resource availability and full VPN 
        functionality supported.  
         
         
         
      
     3.2 Logical PE 
         
      
        A logical PE (LPE) is a PE constructed by distributing VPLS 
        functions across PE-Edges and PE-Cores interconnected by 
        switched Ethernet transport network(s) or one or more than one 
        uplink.

                  Figure 4: Logical PE with PE-Edges and PE-Cores 
      
      
        Within the Logical PE concept, the PE-Edge is connected to the 
        CE through Ethernet ports (which can be logical ports) called 
        LPE endpoints. An LPE endpoint can be defined on the PE-Core or 
        the PE-Edge. An LPE endpoint where the CE is attached to is the 
        demarcation point between the customer and the VPLS service.  
        The PE Core device is connected to the Core network. Multiple 
        PE-Edges can be connected to one or more PE-core.

        PE-Edges interoperate with other PE-Edges between different 
        Logical PEs and within the same Logical PE. PE-Edges 
        interconnected through a switched Ethernet transport domain can 
        inter-operate without involvement of PE-Cores. A network 
        consists of only PE-Edges can also deliver low-scale VPLS 
        services. The PE-Cores provide intermediary functions to enable 
        PE-Edges to interoperate with PEs outside their local Switched 
        Ethernet Transport domain. This may be with another PE or with 
        PE-Edges in other Logical PEs, with PE-Edges in the same LPE 
        but belonging to different switched Ethernet transport domain.  
         
         
        Each PE-Edge/PE-Core is associated with a set of VPLS services. 
        PE-Core implements a layer-2 VPN/VPLS solution and can offer 
        layer-3 VPNs. PE-Cores can also offer VPLS services for 
        directly connected CEs. Finally, when LPEs are used they can 
        communicate with conventional PE devices that are not 
        associated with any PE-Edges. 
         
        PE-Cores are connected in a fully mesh topology. PE-Edges sees 
        only PE-Cores and other PE-Edges in the same switched Ethernet 
        transport domain, therefore there is no direct full meshing 
        between PE-Edges across the core network, and any inter-site 
        connectivity between PE-Edges across the core network will 
        traverse the PE-Cores. However, any inter-site connectivity 
        within the logical PE need not involve other PEs. 
         
         
     3.3 Network Connectivity within the Logical PE  
         
        Various network configurations can be implemented within the 
        Logical PE. This section describes some of these configurations 
        (the LPE scheme is flexible enough to support many other 
        configurations). 
         
     3.3.1 PE-Edges connected directly to the PE-Core 
         
        In this configuration the PE-Edges are connected directly to 
        the PE-Cores using single line Ethernet trunks. For enhanced 
        reliability the PE-Edges can be connected to the PE-Core via 
        two Ethernet trunks where the PE-Core which can be used for 
        load sharing and for recovery from link and device failures.  
         
     3.3.2 Multiple Broadcast Domains in Logical PE 
         
        In this case, a single PE-Core can be connected to PE-Edges via 
        multiple Switched Ethernet Transport domains. An implementation 
        example of Switched Ethernet Transport domain is Resilient 
        Packet Rings (RPR). 
      
     3.4 Logical PE Function Distribution 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.            May 2002                      [Page 13] 
             draft-ouldbrahim-l2vpn-lpe-00.txt       November 2001 
      
      
         
        Logical PE function distribution depends on the VPLS 
        architecture model used. In most cases, the PE-Edge manages the 
        SLA including bandwidth policing, traffic classification and, 
        QoS, customer Ethernet frame encapsulation and MAC and VLAN 
        learning. The PE-Core maintains membership information and 
        performs VPN membership determination and dissemination to all 
        the PE-Cores members of the same VPLS. By using a signaling 
        and/or an auto-discovery mechanism, the PE-Core distributes the 
        VPN and/or endpoint related information to all LPEs. Such 
        distribution can be constrained to only the LPEs that have VPLS 
        membership in common. 
         
        Following are a list of PE functions that can be distributed in 
        forming a LPE: 
         
                o MAC learning  
                o Participation in customer Spanning Tree Protocol  
                  (if needed).  
                o Tunneling within LPE.  
                o Service label de-multiplexing within LPE.  
                o PE-Edge/PE-Core auto-discovery protocol (LPE-AD). 
                o Customer traffic policing and shaping (if necessary)  
                o Customer VLAN processing.  
                o Customer traffic priority handling.  
                o VPLS configuration  
                o VPLS membership determination   
                o Tunneling between PEs (MPLS/IP based)  
                o Service label de-multiplexing between PEs.  
                o VPLS auto-discovery between PEs.  
                o VPLS signaling between PEs (when required). 
         
     3.4.1 PE-Edge Functions 
         
        Typically a PE-Edge being a bridge, a routing switch, or a 
        router will perform regular Ethernet based functions. Among 
        these functions: 
         
        o MAC learning 
        o Participation in customer Spanning Tree Protocol (if needed). 
        o VPLS membership determination 
        o PE-Edge/PE-Core auto-Discovery protocol (LPE-AD). 
        o Tunneling within the LPE. 
        o Service label de-multiplexing within LPE. 
        o Customer traffic policing and shaping (if necessary) 
        o Customer VLAN processing. 
        o Customer traffic priority handling. 
        o VPLS configuration (depending on the configuration model). 
         
     3.4.2 PE-Core Functions 
      

      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.            May 2002                      [Page 14] 
             draft-ouldbrahim-l2vpn-lpe-00.txt       November 2001 
      
      
        A PE-Core being attached to an IP/MPLS network and providing 
        other VPN service than just VPLS should provide the following 
        functions: 
         
        o VPLS membership determination.  
        o Tunneling between PEs (MPLS/IP based). 
        o Service label de-multiplexing between PEs. 
        o VPLS Configuration. 
        o VPLS auto-discovery between PEs. 
        o VPLS signaling between PEs (when required). 
        o PE-Edge/PE-Core auto-discovery protocol (LPE-AD). 
      
     3.5 Logical PE Auto-Discovery Protocol (LPE-AD) 
         
        A lightweight protocol needs to be established between the PE-
        Edge and PE-Core for VPLS information exchange (e.g., 
        membership, tunneling, etc). An example of functions provided 
        by an LPE-AD: 
         
        o Notification of endpoint Addition/Deletion/Modification of  
          VPLSs. 
        o Service Label/Tunnel information exchange at the LPE level. 
        o Addition/Deletion/Modification of PE-Edges. 
      
     3.6 VPLS Membership Determination 
      
        A VPLS service visible at the LPE level can be created either 
        at the PE-Edge or the PE-Core or both. A VPLS solution is a 
        port-based VPN type architecture. Therefore, the VPN membership 
        is accomplished by configuring customer facing ports and 
        associating the port/endpoints to the VPLS VPN membership 
        scheme. Typically a VPLS is associated with a VPN-ID, which 
        uniquely identifies the VPLS across the service provider 
        network. An example of VPN-ID format can be found in [RFC-
        2685]. This draft doesn't preclude the use of other schemes for 
        VPLS membership as those used in layer-3 and optical VPNs 
        (e.g., route-target schemes). 
         
        It may happen that a VPLS has dual membership schemes within 
        the LPE and inter-LPE on the core network. In this case, a VPN 
        membership mapping function is needed at the LPE level.  
         
     3.7 Logical PE Forwarding and Auto-Discovery 
         
        A Logical PE can be applied to a fully meshed point-to-point, 
        virtual switching model, or a hybrid VPLS models. VPLS or VPLS 
        endpoints can be reflected on the PE-Core. For a full mesh 
        point to point, VPLS endpoints defined on each PE-Edge will 
        have a logical representation "virtual endpoint" within the PE-
        Core. Therefore a given PE-Core will reflect multiple VPLS 
        services where each service has multiple endpoints configured 
        on multiple PE-Edges. Each virtual endpoint on the PE-Core is 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.            May 2002                      [Page 15] 
             draft-ouldbrahim-l2vpn-lpe-00.txt       November 2001 
      
      
        fully meshed with other virtual endpoints on the remote PE-
        Cores. Another approach similar to [KOMP-DTLS]is to 
        consider the PE-Edge connectivity as site connectivity and the
        endpoint is associasted with the site (PE-Edge) connectivity. 
      
      
     3.7.1 VPN Auto-Discovery on the Core Network 
         
        On the core network, point-to-point circuits can be created 
        using either [L2VPN-KOMP], or [Martini-TRANSP] type 
        architectures (e.g., [L2VPN-ROSEN]). For example, [MARTINI-
        TRANSP] can be used to create VC LSPs between virtual 
        endpoints. In this scheme, the auto-discovery mechanism is 
        decoupled from signaling. LDP-DU can be used where the VFEC 
        will carry VPLS membership scheme (e.g., VPN-ID) and relevant 
        information about VPLS endpoints (new VFEC parameter IDs can be 
        defined for carrying such information).  
         
        BGP based auto-discovery mechanism can also be used in the core 
        to inform each PE about VPLS membership information (e.g., 
        described in [BGP-AD], and [L2VPN-KOMP]). This draft doesn't 
        preclude other VPN auto-discovery mechanisms (e.g., LDP based). 
      
      
     3.7.2 LPE Forwarding Algorithm for [MARTINI-TRANSP] on the Core 
      
        The following algorithm can be used to forward Unicast Ethernet 
        frames to the remote PE-Edges. It is assumed that MPLS labels 
        are used as de-multiplexing scheme at the PE-Edge and PE-Core. 
        Tunneling is used on the PE-Core (can be IP or MPLS based). 
        Ethernet/MPLS optionally be used between PE-Edge and PE-Core. 
        The LPEs are connected through a full mesh of tunnels (e.g.,  
        traffic engineered tunnels, RSVP-TE/CR-LDP traffic engineered 
        tunnels). 
            
        1. A VPLS is created on the PE-Edge.  
        2. Each VPLS endpoint is mapped to a virtual endpoint on the  
           PE-Core. 
        3. Each PE-Core VPLS virtual endpoint is associated with its   
           membership scheme. 
        4. LPE-AD mechanism is run between the PE-Edge 
           and PE-Core. 
        5. LDP-DU signaling is used by PE_Cores to establish VC LSP 
           between VPLS virtual endpoints across the core.  
        6. A customer frame is received on a given VPLS port on  
           the PE-Edge. 
        7. The packet is labeled to reach the virtual endpoint on the  
           PE-Core.  
        8. The local PE-Core received the packet swap the service  
           label with the remote egress VC LSP label.  
        9. The labeled packet is then tunneled to the remote PE-Core. 
       10. The remote PE-Core performs a lookup on the service label,    
      
 Ould-Brahim, et al.            May 2002                               [Page 16]
             draft-ouldbrahim-l2vpn-lpe-00.txt       November 2001 
      
      
           identifies the egress port where the PE-Edge is attached 
       11. The PE-Core swaps the corresponding PE-Edge service label  
           and forward the packet.  
       12. Once the packet is received by the PE-Edge it will then be 
           forwarded to the egress port.  
      
     3.7.3 LPE Forwarding Algorithm using [L2VPN-KOMP] on the Core 
      
        The following algorithm can be used to forward unicast Ethernet 
        frames to the remote PE-Edges when [KOMP-L2VPN] solution is 
        used in the core network (PE-Cores). The LPEs are connected 
        through a full mesh of point to point tunnels (e.g., traffic 
        engineered tunnels using RSVP-TE/CR-LDP). 
         
         
        1. A VPLS is created on the PE-Edge.  
        2. Each VPLS endpoint is mapped to a virtual endpoint on the  
           PE-Core. 
        3. The virtual endpoint is considered private site attachment  
           to the logical PE. 
        4. An auto-discovery mechanism is run between the PE-Edge 
           and PE-Core. 
        5. Each PE-Core VPLS virtual endpoint is associated with its   
           [KOMP-L2VPN] configuration information (e.g., CE_ID,  
           CE_range, label_base, route-target export and import list  
           for the VPLS virtual forwarding table. 
        5. BGP auto-discovery is used on the core network informing 
           all the PE-Core about the virtual endpoints.  
        6. A customer frame is received on a given VPLS port on  
           the local PE-Edge. 
        7. The packet is labeled with a VPLS service label to reach  
           the virtual endpoint on the PE-Core.  
        8. The local PE-Core look up the label, identify the virtual   
           endpoint, lookup the virtual forwarding table and push the   
           two labels onto the packet (the top label for the LSP to  
           reach the egress PE-Core and the inner label is for  
           reaching the virtual endpoint interface). 
       10. The remote PE-Core performs a lookup on the service label,    
           and identify the egress virtual endpoint. If the endpoint is  
           located on the PE-Edge, the PE-Core swaps the service  
           label with the remote PE-Edge VPLS service label.  
       11. The labeled packet is then tunneled to the remote PE-Edge.  
       12. Once the packet is received by the PE-Edge it will then be 
           forwarded to the egress port.  
         
      
        Another approach with [KOMP-L2VPN] is to consider the PE-
        Edge/PE-Core connectivity as a site connectivity. This approach 
        avoids configuring/learning about virtual endpoints (assuming 
        only Ethernet frames are traversing this link). Example of such 
        scheme can be found in [KOMP-DTLS]. Decouple Transparent LAN 
        model (DTLS) extends the [KOMP-L2VPN] architecture to 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.            May 2002                      [Page 17] 
             draft-ouldbrahim-l2vpn-lpe-00.txt       November 2001 
      
      
        accommodate a VPLS service using the LPE network reference 
        model. 
         
     3.7.4 Virtual Switch Proxy (VSP) 
      
        A virtual switch proxy can be created on the PE-Core for each 
        VPLS defined on the PE-Edge. Virtual switch proxies are fully 
        meshed within the core network. Traffic destined to sites 
        across the core network will traverse the virtual switch proxy.  
        VSP LSPs can be established based on the VPLS/VS membership. 
        MAC learning is still achieved at the PE-Edge level. The model 
        can also extend to create virtual switches at the granularity 
        of PE-Edge connectivity, and treats each PE-Edge connectivity 
        as site connectivity.  
      
        
        LPE Forwarding for user Unknown Unicast, Broadcast, and 
        Multicast Packets using VSP type approach (with no link layer 
        forwarding): 
       
        In the case of unknown unicast, broadcast and multicast packet 
        a VSP type approach can be used as described below: 
         
        1. PE-Edge forward the packet to the PE-Core. 
        2. The PE-Core identifies the VPLS membership of the packet,  
           and finds that it needs to identify the set of PE-Cores  
           members of the same VPLS (i.e., having at least one port  
           member of that VPLS). 
        3. Pe-Core broadcast/multicast the packet to this set of  
           PE-Cores. 
        4. PE Core then appends the service label associated with the  
           membership scheme (i.e., VC GROUP) and tunnel the packet to  
           the far end LPEs. 
        5. When the egress PE-Core receives the MPLS encapsulated  
           packet, it will examine the service label and since it is  
           related to a set of VPLS members, it will map the service 
           label to a set of destination PE-Edges/PE-Edge endpoints. 
        6. When the packet reaches the egress PE-Edge, the PE-Edge  
           learns the binding between source MAC address and the  
           PE-Core within the LPE.  
      
      
     3.8 LPE Configuration Models 
      
        A VPLS service can be configured on the PE-Edge or PE-Core or 
        using a service provider network management system to configure 
        both PE-Edge and PE-Core. The LPE-AD auto-discovery conveys 
        configuration data between PE-Edge and PE-Core. The information 
        needed on the PE-Edge/PE-Core relates to the VPLS membership 
        scheme, the port/endpoint configuration. It may happen that the 
        a different membership scheme is used intra-LPE than the 
        membership used inter-LPE, in this case a mapping function is 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.            May 2002                      [Page 18] 
             draft-ouldbrahim-l2vpn-lpe-00.txt       November 2001 
      
      
        used to maintain unique VPLS membership across the service 
        provider network. 
         
      
     3.9 Quality of Service 
         
        Intra-LPE or inter PE-Core connectivity can be traffic 
        engineered. RSVP-TE/CR-LDP can be used at the core and/or 
        switched Ethernet transport. Customer traffic can be policed 
        and shaped at the access port on the PE-Edge. The customer 
        traffic is classified on the PE-Edge, and is mapped onto the 
        endpoints VC-Labels. Most generally priority configured per 
        access port (at the PE-Edge level) maps the customer 802.1p 
        traffic to the network priority tunneling. This mapping is 
        based on customer VPLS SLA. 
      
      
     3.10 LPE Resiliency 
         
        VPLS/L2VPN architecture resiliency is key to ensure service 
        availability in presence of failures. Indeed, VPLS, like any 
        layer-2 scheme is subject to failures like link, trunk, node 
        failures. 
         
        Within the logical PE, failures can appear at the PE-Edge, PE-
        Core, the PE-Edge/PE-Core interconnecting link or switched 
        Ethernet network. Dual PE-Cores can be used to protect the LPE 
        failure and VPLS failures. Although using two dual PE-Cores, 
        the LPE appears to the network as a single LPE.  
      
     3.11 Security Considerations 
      
        VPLS security needs to be considered within the LPE and inter-
        LPEs.  
         
        Within the LPE Customer traffic needs to be separated within 
        the LPE. Ethernet Qtag, MPLS/IP based tunneling can be used. 
        The level of data path security is same as ATM or FR networks. 
        This document doesn't preclude the use of encryption mechanisms 
        within the LPE (although not recommended, particularly if 
        Ethernet switched transport is used). 
      
        Inter-LPE security is provided within the layer-2 VPN 
        architecture. A range of security parameters can be used, from 
        using link layer type security to full encryption and 
        authentication. An inter-domain solution usually requires some 
        security mechanism across provider boundaries. For full inter-
        provider security (only when needed), IPSec tunneling mechanism 
        is recommended.
