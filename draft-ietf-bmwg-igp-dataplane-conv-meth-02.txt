   1. Introduction
   This draft describes the methodology for benchmarking IGP Route 
   Convergence.  The applicability of this testing is described in 
   [1] and the new terminology that it introduces is defined in [2].
   Service Providers use IGP Convergence time as a key metric of 
   router design and architecture.  Customers of Service Providers 
   observe convergence time by packet loss, so IGP Route Convergence 
   is considered a Direct Measure of Quality (DMOQ).  The test cases 
   in this document are black-box tests that emulate the network 
   events that cause route convergence, as described in [1].  The
   black-box test designs benchmark the data plane accounting for 
   all of the factors contributing to convergence time, as discussed 
   in [1].  The methodology (and terminology) for benchmarking route 
   convergence can be applied to any link-state  IGP such as ISIS [3] 
   and OSPF [4]. 

   2.  Existing definitions

   For the sake of clarity and continuity this RFC adopts the template
   for definitions set out in Section 2 of RFC 1242.  Definitions are
   indexed and grouped together in sections for ease of reference.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

   3.  Test Setup	
   3.1 Test Topologies	

   Figure 1 shows the test topology to measure IGP Route Convergence due 
   to local Convergence Events such as SONET Link Failure, PPP Session 
   Failure, IGP  Adjacency Failure, Route Withdrawal, and route cost 
   change.  These test cases discussed in section 4 provide route 
   convergence times that account for the Event Detection time, SPF 
   Processing time, and FIB Update time.  These times are measured 
   by observing packet loss in the data plane.

   3.2 Test Considerations
   3.2.1 IGP Selection
   The test cases described in section 4 can be used for ISIS or 
   OSPF.  The Route Convergence test methodology for both is 
   identical.  The IGP adjacencies are established on the Preferred 
   Egress Interface and Next-Best Egress Interface.

   3.2.2 BGP Configuration
   The obtained results for IGP Route Convergence may vary if 
   BGP routes are installed.  It is recommended that the IGP 
   Convergence times be benchmarked without BGP routes installed.

Poretsky, Imhoff								[Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT 	   Benchmarking Methodology for	January 2004
           	      IGP Data Plane Route Convergence

   3.2.3 IGP Route Scaling
   The number of IGP routes will impact the measured IGP Route 
   Convergence because convergence for the entire IGP route table is 
   measured.   For results similar to those that would be observed in 
   an operational network it is recommended that the number of 
   installed routes closely approximate that for routers in the 
   network.	

   3.2.4 Timers
   There are some timers that will impact the measured IGP Convergence 
   time. The following timers should be configured to the minimum value 
   prior to beginning execution of the test cases:

	Timer					Recommended Value
	-----					-----------------
   	SONET Failure Indication Delay		<10milliseconds
   	IGP Hello Timer				1 second
   	IGP Dead-Interval			3 seconds
   	LSA Generation Delay			0 
   	LSA Flood Packet Pacing			0
   	LSA Retransmission Packet Pacing	0
   	SPF Delay				0

   3.2.5 Convergence Time Metrics
   The recommended value for the Packet Sampling Interval [2] is 
   100 milliseconds.  Rate-Derived Convergence Time [2] is the 
   preferred benchmark for IGP Route Convergence.  This benchmark 
   must always be reported when the 
   Packet Sampling Interval [2] <= 100 milliseconds.  
   If the test equipment does not permit the Packet Sampling 
   Interval to be set as low as 100 msec, then both the 
   Rate-Derived Convergence Time and Loss-Derived Convergence 
   Time [2] must be reported.	
   
   3.2.6 Offered Load
   An offered Load of maximum forwarding rate at a fixed packet size 
   is recommended for accurate measurement.  The duration of offered 
   load must be greater than the convergence time. 
   
   3.2.7 Interface Types
   All test cases in this methodology document may be executed with
   any interface type.  SONET is recommended and specifically 
   mentioned in the procedures because it can be configured to have 
   no or negligible affect on the measured convergence time.  
   Ethernet (10Mb, 100Mb, 1Gb, and 10Gb) is not preferred since 
   broadcast media are unable to detect loss of host and rely upon 
   IGP Hellos to detect session loss.

   3.3 Reporting Format
   For each test case, it is recommended that the following reporting 
   format be completed:
	
	Parameter					Units
	---------					-----
   	IGP						(ISIS or OSPF)
   	Interface Type					(GigE, POS, ATM, etc.)

	5. Remove SONET on Tester's Neighbor Interface [2] connected to 
   	   one of the DUT's Parallel Link member interfaces.
	6. Measure Rate-Derived Convergence Time [2] as DUT detects the 
	   link down event and converges all IGP routes and traffic over 
	   the other Parallel Link members.
	7. Restore SONET on Tester's Neighbor Interface connected to 
   	   DUT's Parallel Link member interface.
	8. Measure Restoration Convergence Time [2] as DUT detects the 
	   link up event and converges IGP routes and some distribution
	   of traffic over the restored Parallel Link member.

	Results
	The measured IGP Convergence time is influenced by the Local
	SONET indication, Tree Build Time, and Hardware Update Time.

   5. Security Considerations

        Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of
        the Internet or corporate networks as long as benchmarking
        is not performed on devices or systems connected to operating
        networks.
