Abstract

   This memo modifies the original Host Resources MIB (RFC 1514) by
   converting it to the SNMPv2 SMI.  Further, this memo adds
   clarifying text, based on implementation and deployment experience,
   to ambiguous MIB object specifications.  It does not add nor remove
   managed objects from the original specification nor change their
   fundamental semantics.

   The original memo defines a MIB for use with managing host systems.
   This memo does not modify the original RFC's definitions or
   assumptions.  Included from the original RFC [1]:

       The term "host" is construed to mean any computer that
       communicates with other similar computers attached to the
       internet and that is directly used by one or more human
       beings. Although this MIB does not necessarily apply to devices
       whose primary function is communications services (e.g.,
       terminal servers, routers, bridges, monitoring equipment), such
       relevance is not explicitly precluded.  This MIB instruments
       attributes common to all internet hosts including, for example,
       both personal computers and systems that run variants of Unix.

1.  Overview

   The Host Resources MIB defines a uniform set of objects useful for
   the management of host computers.  Host computers  are independent of
   the operating system, network services, or any software application.

   The Host Resources MIB defines objects which are common across many
   computer system architectures.

   In addition, there are objects in MIB-II [3] which also provide host
   management functionality. Implementation of the System and Interfaces
   groups is mandatory for implementors of the Host Resources MIB.

2.  Modifications to the original Host Resources MIB (RFC 1514)

    This memo does not alter the original Host Resources MIB (RFC
    1514) by adding or removing MIB objects.  Rather, it converts the
    original MIB specification to the SMIv2 [5] and adds clarifying
    text to several MIB objects based on implementation experience and
    feedback from real users of the MIB.

    Additional storage, filesystem, and device types are clearly
    warranted but should be specified in a separate document rather
    than in this MIB specification itself.  The original storage,
    filesystem, and device types are preserved here in this memo for
    compatibility's sake.

2.1 Conversion to SMIv2

    The conversion from SMIv1 to SMIv2 occurred using the algorithm
    provided in [2] as a rough guideline.  More specifically, the
    following actions were taken:

      + Addition of MODULE-IDENTIFY clause from SMIv2 RFC 1902.

      + All objects specifications were converted to use the SMIv2
        OBJECT-TYPE macro defined in RFC 1902.



Oct  1 10:12 1998  Internet Draft,Host Resources MIB V2        Page 3


      + Type changes
        - Counter to Counter32
        - Gauge to Gauge32
        - INTEGER to Integer32 where appropriate

      + hrPrinterDetectedErrorState syntax changed to BITS to better
        document its syntax and semantics.  Further, at the request of
        the printer-working group (PWG), additional bit definitions
        have been added.  These changes are backwards compatible with
        the original RFC 1514 specification.

      + Compliance branch and statements have been added as per the
        MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro from RFC 1904 [6].  This macro formalizes
        the notion of mandatory and optional MIB groupings which have
        previously been specified in natural language text
        accompanying a MIB document.  The branch hrConformance has
        been added as branch 7 under the main MIB branch.

2.2 Managed Object Clarifications

   The specification for hrNetworkIfIndex states that the value of a
   network device's ifIndex value be returned.  However, not all network
   devices contained in a host system may have a corresponding ifIndex
   value.  In this case, the value of 0 should be returned for
   hrNetworkIfIndex.

   The definition of the hrSWInstalledTable and accompanying MIB
   objects is somewhat ambiguous when it comes to discerning between
   applications and software packages installed on the underlying
   system.  Further, implementation and deployment experience have led
   the author to acknowledge the usefulness of information pertaining
   to installed packages, the definition of the hrSWInstalledTable
   should be expanded to include software packages installed on the
   underlying system.  Included in this expanded definition of
   "software" are system and application patches.  This expansion of
   the definition of installed software is consistent with many users
   and with the original MIB's interpretation in [4] which was
   reviewed by one of the editors of the original specification.

              These entries are associated with logical storage
              areas, as might be seen by an application, rather
              than physical storage entities which are typically
              seen by an operating system.  Storage such as tapes
              and floppies without file systems on them are
              typically not allocated in chunks by the operating
              system to requesting applications, and therefore

               7, the most significant bit of the second byte
               being bit 8, and so on.  A one bit encodes that
               the condition was detected, while a zero bit
               encodes that the condition was not detected.

               This object is useful for alerting an operator to
               specific warning or error conditions that may
               occur, especially those requiring human
               intervention.

               Because error bits 8 through 14 can indicate a printer

               (recommended) printer hrDeviceStatus can be either
               warning(3) or down(5).
