1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   Constrained devices, aka. sensor, smart object, or smart device, with
   limited CPU, memory, and power resources, can constitute a network.
   Such a network of constrained devices itself may be constrained or
   challenged, e.g., with unreliable or lossy channels, wireless
   technologies with limited bandwidth and a dynamic topology, needing
   the service of a gateway or proxy to connect to the Internet.  In
   other scenarios, the constrained devices can be connected to a non-
   constrained network using off-the-shelf protocol stacks.

   Constrained devices might be in charge of gathering information in
   diverse settings including natural ecosystems, buildings, and
   factories, and send the information to one or more server stations.
   Constrained devices may also work under severe resource constraints
   such as limited battery and computing power, little memory and
   insufficient wireless bandwidth, and communication capabilities.  A
   central entity, e.g., a base station or controlling server, might
   have more computational and communication resources and can act as a
   gateway between the constrained devices and the application logic in
   the core network.

   Today diverse size of constrained devices with different resources
   and capabilities are being connected.  Mobile personal gadgets,
   building-automation devices, cellular phones, Machine-to-machine
   (M2M) devices, etc. benefit from interacting with other "things" in
   the near or somewhere in the Internet.  With this the Internet of
   Things (IoT) becomes a reality, build up of uniquely identifiable
   objects (things).  And over the next decade, this could grow to
   trillions of constrained devices and will greatly increase the
   Internet's size and scope.

   Network management is characterized by monitoring network status,
   detecting faults, and inferring their causes, setting network
   parameters, and carrying out actions to remove faults, maintain
   normal operation, and improve network efficiency and application
   performance.  The traditional network monitoring application
   periodically collects information from a set of elements that are
   needed to manage, processes the data, and presents them to the
   network management users.  Constrained devices, however, often have
   limited power, low transmission range, and might be unreliable.  They
   might also need to work in hostile environments with advanced
   security requirements or need to be used in harsh environments for a
   long time without supervision.  Due to such constraints, the
   management of a network with constrained devices faces different type
   of challenges compared to the management of a traditional IP network.

   The IETF has already done substantial standardization work to enable
   the communication in IP networks and to manage such networks as well
   as the manifold type of nodes in these networks [RFC6632].  However,
   the IETF so far has not developed any specific technologies for the
   management of constrained devices and the networks comprised by
   constrained devices.  IP-based sensors or constrained devices in such
   an environment, i.e., devices with very limited memory, CPU, and
   energy resources, use nowadays application-layer protocols in an ad-
   hoc manner to do simple resource management and monitoring.

   This document provides a problem statement and lists potential
   requirements for the management of a network with constrained
   devices.  Section 1.3 and Section 1.5 describe different topology
   options for the networking and management of constrained devices.
   Section 2 provides a problem statement on the issue of the management
   of networked constrained devices.  Section 3 lists requirements on
   the management of applications and networks with constrained devices.
   Note that the requirements listed in Section 3 have been separated
   from the context in which they may appear.  Depending on the concrete
   circumstances, an implementer may decide to address a certain
   relevant subset of the requirements.

   The use cases in the context of networks with constrained devices can
   be found in the companion document [COM-USE].

1.2.  Terminology

   Concerning constrained devices and networks this document generally
   builds on the terminology defined in [RFC7228], where the terms
   Constrained Device, Constrained Network, etc. are defined.

   The following terms are additionally used throughout this
   documentation:

   AMI:  (Advanced Metering Infrastructure) A system including hardware,
      software, and networking technologies that measures, collects, and
      analyzes energy usage, and communicates with a hierarchically
      deployed network of metering devices, either on request or on a
      schedule.

   C0:  Class 0 constrained device as defined in Section 3. of
      [RFC7228].

   C1:  Class 1 constrained device as defined in Section 3. of
      [RFC7228].

   C2:  Class 2 constrained device as defined in Section 3. of
      [RFC7228].

Internet-Draft         Constrained Mgmt: PS, Rqmts          January 2015


   Network of Constrained Devices:  A network to which constrained
      devices are connected that may or may not be a Constrained Network
      (see [RFC7228] for the definition of the term Constrained
      Network).

   M2M:  (Machine to Machine) stands for the automatic data transfer
      between devices of different kind.  In M2M scenarios a device
      (such as a sensor or meter) captures an event, which is relayed
      through a network (wireless, wired or hybrid) to an application.

   MANET:  Mobile Ad-hoc Networks [RFC2501], a self-configuring and
      infrastructureless network of mobile devices connected by wireless
      technologies.

   Smart Grid:  An electrical grid that uses communication technologies
      to gather and act on information in an automated fashion to
      improve the efficiency, reliability and sustainability of the
      production and distribution of electricity.

   Smart Meter:  An electrical meter in the context of a Smart Grid.

      For a detailed discussion on the constrained networks as well as
      classes of constrained devices and their capabilities please see
      [RFC7228].

1.3.  Network Types and Characteristics in Focus

   In this document we differentiate following types of networks
   concerning their transport and communication technologies:

   (Note that a network in general can involve constrained and non-
   constrained devices.)

   1.  Wireline non-constrained networks, e.g., an Ethernet-LAN with
       constrained and non-constrained devices involved.

   2.  A combination of wireline and wireless networks, possibly with a
       multi-hop connectivity between constrained devices, utilizing
       dynamic routing in both the wireless and wireline portions of the
       network.  Such networks usually support highly distributed
       applications with many nodes (e.g., environmental monitoring) and
       tend to deal with large-scale multipoint-to-point systems.
       Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN), as a specific variant, use off-the-
       shelf radio technology such as Wi-Fi, WiMax, and cellular 3G/4G.
       WMNs are reliable based on the redundancy they offer and have
       often a more planned deployment to provide dynamic and cost
       effective connectivity over a certain geographic area.

Internet-Draft         Constrained Mgmt: PS, Rqmts          January 2015


   3.  A combination of wireline and wireless networks with point-to-
       point or point-to-multipoint communication generally with single-
       hop connectivity to constrained devices, utilizing static routing
       over the wireless network.  Such networks support short-range,
       point-to-point, low-data-rate, source-to-sink type of
       applications such as RFID systems, light switches, fire and smoke
       detectors, and home appliances.  This type of networks also
       support confined short-range spaces such as a home, a factory, a
       building, or the human body.  IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth) and IEEE
       802.15.4 are well-known examples of applicable standards for such
       networks.  By using 6LowPAN (IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless
       Personal Area Networks) [RFC4919] and RPL (IPv6 Routing Protocol
       for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) [RFC6550] on top of IEEE
       802.15.4, multi-hop connectivity and dynamic routing can be
       achieved.  With RPL the IETF has specified a proactive route-over
       architecture where routing and forwarding is implemented at the
       network layer.  The protocol provides a mechanism whereby
       multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint and point-to-point
       traffic are supported.

   4.  Self-configuring infrastructureless networks of mobile devices
       (e.g., Mobile Adhoc networks, MANET) are a particular type of
       network connected by wireless technologies.  Infrastructureless
       networks are mostly based on point-to-point communications of
       devices moving independently in any direction and changing the
       links to other devices frequently.  Such devices do act as a
       router to forward traffic unrelated to their own use.

   Wireline non-constrained networks with constrained and non-
   constrained devices are mainly used for specific applications like
   Building Automation or Infrastructure Monitoring.  Wireline and
   wireless networks with multi-hop or point-to-multipoint connectivity
   are used e.g., for environmental monitoring as well as transport and
   mobile applications.

   Furthermore different network characteristics are determined by
   multiple dimensions: dynamicity of the topology, bandwidth, and loss
   rate.  In the following, each dimension is explained, and networks in
   scope for this document are outlined:

   Network Topology:

   The topology of a network can be represented as a graph, with edges
   (i.e., links) and vertices (routers and hosts).  Examples of
   different topologies include "star" topologies (with one central node
   and multiple nodes in one hop distance), tree structures (with each
   node having exactly one parent), directed acyclic graphs (with each
   node having one or more parents), clustered topologies (where one or



Ersue, et al.             Expires July 22, 2015                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         Constrained Mgmt: PS, Rqmts          January 2015


   more "cluster heads" are responsible for a certain area of the
   network), mesh topologies (fully distributed), etc.

   Management protocols may take advantage of specific network
   topologies, for example by distributing large-scale management tasks
   amongst multiple distributed network management stations (e.g., in
   case of a mesh topology), or by using a hierarchical management
   approach (e.g., in case of a tree or clustered topology).  These
   different management topology options are described in Section 1.6.

   Note that in certain network deployments, such as community ad hoc
   networks (see the use case "Community Network Applications" in [COM-
   USE]), the topology is not pre-planned, and thus may be unknown for
   management purposes.  In other use cases, such as industrial
   applications (see the use case "Industrial Applications" in [COM-
   USE]), the topology may be designed in advance and therefore taken
   advantage of when managing the network.

   Dynamicity of the network topology:

   The dynamicity of the network topology determines the rate of change
   of the graph as a function of time.  Such changes can occur due to
   different factors, such as mobility of nodes (e.g., in MANETs or
   cellular networks), duty cycles (for low-power devices enabling their
   network interface only periodically to transmit or receive packets),
   or unstable links (in particular wireless links with strongly
   fluctuating link quality).

   Examples of different levels of dynamicity of the topology are
   Ethernets (with typically a very static topology) on the one side,
   and low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) on the other side.  LLNs
   nodes are often duty-cycled and operate on unreliable wireless links
   and are potentially mobile (e.g., for sensor networks).

   The more dynamic the topology is, the more have routing, transport
   and application layer protocols to cope with interrupted connectivity
   and/or longer delays.  For example, management protocols (with a
   given underlying transport protocol) that expect continuous session
   flows without changes of routes during a communication flow, may fail
   to operate.

   Networks with a very low dynamicity (e.g., Ethernet) with no or
   infrequent topology changes (e.g., less than once every 30 minutes),
   are in-scope of this document if they are used with constrained
   devices (see e.g., the use case "Building Automation" in [COM-USE]).

   Traffic flows:




Ersue, et al.             Expires July 22, 2015                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         Constrained Mgmt: PS, Rqmts          January 2015


   The traffic flow in a network determines from which sources data
   traffic is sent to which destinations in the network.  Several
   different traffic flows are defined in [RFC7102], including "point-
   to-point" (P2P), "multipoint-to-point" (MP2P), and "point-to-
   multipoint" (P2MP) flows as:

   o  P2P: Point-To-Point.  This refers to traffic exchanged between two
      nodes (regardless of the number of hops between the two nodes).

   o  P2MP: Point-to-Multipoint traffic refers to traffic between one
      node and a set of nodes.  This is similar to the P2MP concept in
      Multicast or MPLS Traffic Engineering.

   o  MP2P: Multipoint-to-Point is used to describe a particular traffic
      pattern (e.g., MP2P flows collecting information from many nodes
      flowing inwards towards a collecting sink).

   If one of these traffic patterns is predominant in a network,
   protocols (routing, transport, application) may be optimized for the
   specific traffic flow.  For example, in a network with a tree
   topology and MP2P traffic, collection tree protocols are efficient to
   send data from the leaves of the tree to the root of the tree, via
   each node's parent.

   Bandwidth:

   The bandwidth of the network is the amount of data that can be sent
   per unit of time between two communication end-points.  It is usually
   determined by the link with the minimum bandwidth on the path from
   the source to the destination of data packets.  The bandwidth in
   networks can range from a few Kilobytes per second (such as on some
   802.15.4 link layers) to many Gigabytes per second (e.g., on fiber
   optics).

   For management purposes, the management protocol typically requires
   to send information between the network management station and the
   clients, for monitoring or control purposes.  If the available
   bandwidth is insufficient for the management protocol, packets will
   be buffered and eventually dropped, and thus management is not
   possible with such a protocol.

   Networks without bandwidth limitation (e.g., Ethernet) are in-scope
   of this document if they are used with constrained devices (see the
   use case "Building Automation" in [COM-USE]).

   Loss rate:





Ersue, et al.             Expires July 22, 2015                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         Constrained Mgmt: PS, Rqmts          January 2015


   The loss rate (or bit error rate) is the number of bit errors divided
   by the total number of bits transmitted.  For wired networks, loss
   rates are typically extremely low, e.g., around 10^-12 or 10^-13 for
   the latest 10Gbit Ethernet.  For wireless networks, such as 802.15.4,
   the bit error rate can be as high as 10^-1 to 1 in case of
   interferences.  Even when using a reliable transport protocol,
   management operations can fail if the loss rate is too high, unless
   they are specifically designed to cope with these situations.

1.4.  Constrained Device Deployment Options

   We differentiate following deployment options for the constrained
   devices:

   o  A network of constrained devices that communicate with each other,

   o  Constrained devices, which are connected directly to an IP
      network,

   o  A network of constrained devices which communicate with a gateway
      or proxy with more communication capabilities acting possibly as a
      representative of the device to entities in the non-constrained
      network

   o  Constrained devices, which are connected to the Internet or an IP
      network via a gateway/proxy

   o  A hierarchy of constrained devices, e.g., a network of C0 devices
      connected to one or more C1 devices - connected to one or more C2
      devices - connected to one or more gateways - connected to some
      application servers or NMS system

   o  The possibility of device grouping (possibly in a dynamic manner)
      such as that the grouped devices can act as one logical device at
      the edge of the network and one device in this group can act as
      the managing entity

1.5.  Management Topology Options

   We differentiate following options for the management of networks of
   constrained devices:

   o  A network of constrained devices managed by one central manager.
      A logically centralized management might be implemented in a
      hierarchical fashion for scalability and robustness reasons.  The
      manager and the management application logic might have a gateway/
      proxy in between or might be on different nodes in different
      networks, e.g., management application running on a cloud server.

Internet-Draft         Constrained Mgmt: PS, Rqmts          January 2015


   o  Distributed management, where a network of constrained devices is
      managed by more than one manager.  Each manager controls a
      subnetwork and may communicate directly with other manager
      stations in a cooperative fashion.  The distributed management may
      be weakly distributed, where functions are broken down and
      assigned to many managers dynamically, or strongly distributed,
      where almost all managed things have embedded management
      functionality and explicit management disappears, which usually
      comes with the price that the strongly distributed management
      logic now needs to be managed.

   o  Hierarchical management, where a hierarchy of networks with
      constrained devices are managed by the managers at their
      corresponding hierarchy level.  I.e., each manager is responsible
      for managing the nodes in its sub-network.  It passes information
      from its sub-network to its higher-level manager, and disseminates
      management functions received from the higher-level manager to its
      sub-network.  Hierarchical management is essentially a scalability
      mechanism, logically the decision-making may be still centralized.

1.6.  Managing the Constrainedness of a Device or Network

   The capabilities of a constrained device or network and the
   constrainedness thereof influence and have an impact on the
   requirements for the management of such network or devices.

   Note that the list below gives examples and does not claim
   completeness.

   A constrained device:

   o  might only support an unreliable (e.g. lossy) radio link, i.e.,
      the client and server of a management protocol need to gracefully
      handle incomplete command exchanges or missing commands.

   o  might only be able to go online from time-to-time, where it is
      reachable, i.e., a command might be necessary to repeat after a
      longer timeout or the timeout value with which one endpoint waits
      on a response needs to be sufficiently high.

   o  might only be able to support a limited operating time (e.g.,
      based on the available battery), or may behave as 'sleepy
      endpoints' setting their network links to a disconnected state
      during long periods of time i.e., the devices need to economize
      their energy usage with suitable mechanisms and the managing
      entity needs to monitor and control the energy status of the
      constrained devices it manages.

Internet-Draft         Constrained Mgmt: PS, Rqmts          January 2015


   o  might only be able to support one simple communication protocol,
      i.e., the management protocol needs to be possible to downscale
      from constrained (C2) to very constrained (C0) devices with
      modular implementation and a very basic version with just a few
      simple commands.

   o  might only be able to support a communication protocol, which is
      not IP-based.

   o  might only be able to support limited or no user and/or transport
      security, i.e., the management system needs to support a less-
      costly and simple but sufficiently secure authentication
      mechanism.

   o  might not be able to support compression and decompression of
      exchanged data based on limited CPU power, i.e., an intermediary
      entity which is capable of data compression should be able to
      communicate with both, devices that support data compression
      (e.g., C2) and devices that do not support data compression (e.g.,
      C1 and C0).

   o  might only be able to support a simple encryption, i.e., it would
      be beneficial if the devices use cryptographic algorithms that are
      supported in hardware and the encryption used is efficient in
      terms of memory and CPU usage.

   o  might only be able to communicate with one single managing entity
      and cannot support the parallel access of many managing entities.

   o  might depend on a self-configuration feature, i.e., the managing
      entity might not know all devices in a network and the device
      needs to be able to initiate connection setup for the device
      configuration.

   o  might depend on self- or neighbor-monitoring feature, i.e., the
      managing entity might not be able to monitor all devices in a
      network continuously.

   o  might only be able to communicate with its neighbors, i.e., the
      device should be able to get its configuration from a neighbor.

   o  might only be able to support parsing of data models with limited
      size, i.e., the device data models need to be compact containing
      the most necessary data and if possible parsable as a stream.

   o  might only be able to support a limited or no failure detection,
      i.e., the managing entity needs to handle the situation, where a

      failure does not get detected or gets detected late gracefully
      e.g., with asking repeatedly.

   o  might only be able to support the reporting of just one or a
      limited set failure types.

   o  might only be able to support a limited set of notifications,
      possible only an "I-am-alive" message.

   o  might only be able to support a soft-reset from failure recovery.

   o  might possibly generate a large amount of redundant reporting
      data, i.e., the intermediary management entity (see [RFC7252])
      should be able to filter and aggregate redundant data.

   A network of constrained devices:

   o  might only support an unreliable (e.g. lossy) radio link, i.e.,
      the client and server of a management protocol need to repeat
      commands as necessary or gracefully ignore incomplete commands.

   o  might be necessary to manage based on multicast communication,
      i.e., the managing entity needs to be prepared to configure many
      devices at once based on the same data model.

   o  might have a very large topology supporting 10,000 or more nodes
      for some applications and as such node naming is a specific issue
      for constrained networks.

   o  needs to support self-organization, i.e., given the large number
      of nodes and their potential placement in hostile locations and
      frequently changing topology, manual configuration of nodes is
      typically not feasible.  As such, the network would benefit from
      the ability to reconfigure itself so that it can continue to
      operate properly and support reliable connectivity.

   o  might need a management solution that is energy-efficient, using
      as little wireless bandwidth as possible since communication is
      highly energy demanding.

   o  needs to support localization schemes to determine the location of
      devices since the devices might be moving and location information
      is important for some applications.

   o  needs a management solution that is scalable as the network may
      consist of thousands of nodes and may need to be extended
      continuously.

   o  needs to provide fault tolerance.  Faults in network operation
      including hardware and software errors or failures detected by the
      transport protocol should be handled smoothly.  In such a case it
      should be possible to run the protocol possibly at a reduced level
      but avoiding to fail completely.  E.g., self-monitoring mechanisms
      or graceful degradation of features can be used to provide fault
      tolerance.

   o  might require new management capabilities: for example, network
      coverage information and a constrained device power-distribution-
      map.

   o  might require a new management function for data management, since
      the type and amount of data collected in constrained networks is
      different from those of the traditional networks.

   o  might also need energy-efficient key management.

1.7.  Configuration and Monitoring Functionality Levels

   Devices often differ significantly on the level of configuration
   management support they provide.  This document classifies the
   configuration management functionality as follows:

   CL0:  Devices are pre-configured and allow no runtime configuration
      changes.  Configuration parameters are often hard coded and
      compiled directly into the firmware image.

   CL1:  Devices have explicit configuration objects.  However, changes
      require a restart of the device to take effect.

   CL2:  Devices allow management systems to replace the entire
      configuration (or pre-determined subsets) in bulk.  Configuration
      changes take effect by soft-restarts of the system (or
      subsystems).

   CL3:  Devices allow management systems to modify configuration
      objects without bulk replacements and changes take effect
      immediately.

   CL4:  Devices support multiple configuration datastores and they
      might distinguish between the currently running and the next
      startup configuration.

   CL5:  Devices support configuration datastore locking and device-
      local configuration change transactions, i.e., either all
      configuration changes are applied or none of them.

Internet-Draft         Constrained Mgmt: PS, Rqmts          January 2015


   CL6:  Devices support configuration change transactions across
      devices.

   This document defines a classification of devices with regards to
   different levels of monitoring support.  In general a device may be
   in several of the levels listed below:

   ML0:  Devices push pre-defined monitoring data.

   ML1:  Devices allow management systems to pull pre-defined monitoring
      data.

   ML2:  Devices allow management systems to pull user-defined filtered
      subsets of monitoring data.

   ML3:  Devices are able to locally process monitoring data in order to
      detect threshold crossings or to aggregate data.

   At the time of this writing, constrained devices often implement a
   combination of one of CL0-CL2 with one of ML0-ML1.

2.  Problem Statement

   The terminology for the "Internet of Things" is still nascent, and
   depending on the network type or layer in focus diverse technologies
   and terms are in use.  Common to all these considerations is the
   "Things" or "Objects" are supposed to have physical or virtual
   identities using interfaces to communicate.  In this context, we need
   to differentiate between the Constrained and Smart Devices identified
   by an IP address compared to virtual entities such as Smart Objects,
   which can be identified as a resource or a virtual object by using a
   unique identifier.  Furthermore, the smart devices usually have a
   limited memory and CPU power as well as aim to be self-configuring
   and easy to deploy.

   However, the constraints of the network nodes require a rethinking of
   the protocol characteristics concerning power consumption,
   performance, bandwidth consumption, memory, and CPU usage.  As such,
   there is a demand for protocol simplification, energy-efficient
   communication, less CPU usage and smaller memory footprint.

   On the application layer the IETF is already developing protocols
   like the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] enabling
   the communication of constrained devices and networks e.g., for smart
   energy applications or home automation environments.  The deployment
   of such an environment involves in fact many, in some scenarios up to
   million constrained devices (e.g., smart meters), which produce a




Ersue, et al.             Expires July 22, 2015                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft         Constrained Mgmt: PS, Rqmts          January 2015


   large amount of data.  This data needs to be collected, filtered, and
   pre-processed for further use in diverse services.

   Considering the high number of nodes to deploy, one has to think
   about the manageability aspects of the smart devices and plan for
   easy deployment, configuration, and management of the networks of
   constrained devices as well as the devices themselves.  Consequently,
   seamless monitoring and self-configuration of such network nodes
   becomes more and more imperative.  Self-configuration and self-
   management is already a reality in the standards of some of the
   bodies such as 3GPP.  To introduce self-configuration of smart
   devices successfully a device-initiated connection establishment is
   often required.

   A simple and efficient application layer protocol, such as CoAP, is
   essential to address the issue of efficient object-to-object
   communication and information exchange.  Such an information exchange
   should be done based on interoperable data models to enable the
   exchange and interpretation of diverse application and management
   related data.

   In an ideal world, we would have only one network management protocol
   for monitoring, configuration, and exchanging management data,
   independently of the type of the network (e.g., Smart Grid, wireless
   access, or core network).  Furthermore, it would be desirable to
   derive the basic data models for constrained devices from the core
   models used today to enable reuse of functionality and end-to-end
   information exchange.  However, the current management protocols seem
   to be too heavyweight compared to the capabilities the constrained
   devices have and are not applicable directly for the use in a network
   of constrained devices.  Furthermore, the data models addressing the
   requirements of such smart devices need yet to be designed.

   The IETF so far has not developed any specific technologies for the
   management of constrained devices and the networks comprised by
   constrained devices.  IP-based sensors or constrained devices in such
   an environment, i.e., devices with very limited memory and CPU
   resources, use today, e.g., application-layer protocols to do simple
   resource management and monitoring.  This might be sufficient for
   some basic cases, however, there is a need to reconsider the network
   management mechanisms based on the new, changed, as well as reduced
   requirements coming from smart devices and the network of such
   constrained devices.  Albeit it is questionable whether we can take
   the same comprehensive approach we use in an IP network also for the
   management of constrained devices.  Hence, the management of a
   network with constrained devices is necessary to design in a
   simplified and less complex manner.

   As Section 1.6 highlights, there are diverse characteristics of
   constrained devices or networks, which stem from their
   constrainedness and therefore have an impact on the requirements for
   the management of such a network with constrained devices.  The use
   cases discussed in [COM-USE] show that the requirements on
   constrained networks are manifold and need to be analyzed from
   different angles, e.g., concerning the design of the management
   architecture, the selection of the appropriate protocol features as
   well as the specific issues which are new in the context of
   constrained devices.  Examples of such issues are e.g., the careful
   management of the scarce energy resources, the necessity for self-
   organization and self-management of such devices but also the
   implementation considerations to enable the use of common
   communication technologies on a constrained hardware in an efficient
   manner.  For an exhaustive list of issues and requirements that need
   to be addressed for the management of a network with constrained
   devices please see Section 1.6 and Section 3.

3.  Requirements on the Management of Networks with Constrained Devices

   This section describes the requirements categorized by management
   areas listed in subsections.

   Note that the requirements listed in this section have been separated
   from the context in which they may appear.  This document in general
   does not recommend the realization of any subset of the described
   requirements.  As such this document avoids selecting any of the
   requirements as mandatory to implement.  A device might be able to
   provide only a particular selected set of requirements and might not
   be capable to provide all requirements in this document.  On the
   other hand a device vendor might select a specific relevant subset of
   the requirements to implement.

   The following template is used for the definition of the
   requirements.

   Requirement Type:  Functional Requirement, Non-Functional
      Requirement.  A functional requirement is related to a function or
      component.  As such functional requirements may be technical
      details, or specific functionality that define what a system is
      supposed to accomplish.  Non-functional requirements (also known
      as design constraints or quality requirements) impose
      implementation-related considerations such as performance
      requirements, security, or reliability.

   Device type:  The device types by which this requirement can be
      supported: C0, C1 and/or C2.

   Priority:  The priority of the requirement showing its importance for
      a particular type of device: High, Medium, and Low. The priority
      of a requirement can be High e.g., for a C2 device but Low for a
      C1 or C0 device as the realization of complex features in a C1
      device is in many cases not possible.

   Description:  Provide means by which the behavior of the network can

      specific configuration from the network-wide configuration.  Such
      a repository can be used to configure pre-defined device or
      protocol parameters for the whole network.  Furthermore, such a
      network-wide view can be used to monitor and manage a group of
      routers or a whole network.  E.g., monitoring the performance of a
      network requires additional information other than what can be
      acquired from a single router using a management protocol.

   Title:  Consistency of data models with the underlying information
      model

   Description:  The data models used by the management protocol must be
      consistent with the information model used to define data models
      for non-constrained networks.  This is essential to facilitate the
      integration of the management of constrained networks with the
      management of non-constrained networks.  Using an underlying
      information model for future data model design enables furthermore
      top-down model design and model reuse as well as data
      interoperability (i.e., exchange of management information between
      the constrained and non-constrained networks).  This is a strong
      requirement, even despite the fact that the underlying information
      models are often not explicitly documented in the IETF.

   Description:  Diverse applications need a reliable transport of
      messages.  The reliability might be achieved based on a transport
      protocol such as TCP or can be supported based on message
      repetition if an acknowledgment is missing.

   Source:  Generally applications benefit from the reliability of the
      message transport.

   Requirement Type:  Functional Requirement

   Device type:  C0, C1, and C2

   Req-ID:  10.003

   Title:  Best-effort multicast

   Description:  Provide best-effort multicast of messages, which is
      generally useful when devices need to discover a service provided
      by a server or many devices need to be configured by a managing
      entity at once based on the same data model.

   Source:  Use cases where a device needs to discover services as well
      as use cases with high amount of devices to manage, which are
      hierarchically deployed, e.g., AMI or M2M.

   Requirement Type:  Functional Requirement

   Title:  Secure message transport

   Description:  Enable secure message transport providing
      authentication, data integrity, confidentiality by using existing
      transport layer technologies with small footprint such as TLS/
      DTLS.

3.11.  Implementation Requirements

   Req-ID:  11.001

   Title:  Avoid complex application layer transactions requiring large
      application layer messages.

   Description:  Complex application layer transactions tend to require
      large memory buffers that are typically not available on C0 or C1
      devices and only by limiting functionality on C2 devices.
      Furthermore, the failure of a single large transaction requires
      repeating the whole transaction.  On constrained devices, it is
      often more desirable to split a large transaction into a sequence
      of smaller transactions that require less resources and allow to
      make progress using a sequence of smaller steps.

   Source:  Basic requirement which concerns all use cases with memory
      constrained devices.

   Title:  Avoid reassembly of messages at multiple layers in the
      protocol stack.

   Description:  Reassembly of messages at multiple layers in the
      protocol stack requires buffers at multiple layers, which leads to
      inefficient use of memory resources.  This can be avoided by
      making sure the application layer, the security layer, the
      transport layer, the IPv6 layer and any adaptation layers are
      aware of the limitations of each other such that unnecessary
      fragmentation and reassembly can be avoided.  In addition, message
      size constraints must be announced to protocol peers such that
      they can adapt and avoid sending messages that can't be processed
      due to resource constraints on the receiving device.

   Source:  Basic requirement which concerns all use cases with memory
      constrained devices.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new code-points or namespaces
   for registration with IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses the problem statement and requirements on
   networks of constrained devices.  Section 1.6 mentions a number of
   limitations that could prevent the implementation of strong
   cryptographic algorithms.  Requirements for security and access
   control are listed in Section 3.6.

   Constrained devices might be deployed often in unsafe environments,
   where attackers can gain physical access to the devices.  As a
   consequence, it is crucial to properly protect any security
   credentials that may be stored on the device (e.g., by using hardware
   protection mechanisms).  Furthermore, it is important that any

   credentials leaking from a single device do not simplify the attack
   on other (similar) devices.  In particular, security credentials
   should never be shared.

   Since constrained devices often have limited computational resources,
   care should be taken in choosing efficient but cryptographically
   strong cryptographic algorithms.  Designers of constrained devices
   that have a long expected lifetime need to ensure that cryptographic
   algorithms can be updated once devices have been deployed.  The
   ability to perform secure firmware and software updates is an
   important management requirement.

   Constrained devices might also generate sensitive data or require the
   processing of sensitive data.  It is therefore an important
   requirement to properly protect access to the data in order to
   protect the privacy of humans using Internet-enabled devices.  For
   certain types of data, protection during the transmission over the
   network may not be sufficient and methods should be investigated that
   provide protection of data while it is cached or stored (e.g., when
   using a store-and-forward transport mechanism).
