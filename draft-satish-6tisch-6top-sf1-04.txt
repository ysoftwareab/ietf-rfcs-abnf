  Scheduling Function One (SF1): hop-by-hop Scheduling with RSVP-TE in
                            6tisch Networks
                    draft-satish-6tisch-6top-sf1-04

Abstract

   This document defines a 6top Scheduling Function called "Scheduling
   Function One" (SF1) to reserve, label and schedule the end-to-end
   resources hop-by-hop through the Resource ReserVation Protocol -
   Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE).  SF1 uses the 6P signaling messages
   with a global TrackID to add or delete the cells in L2-bundles of
   isolated traffic flows.

1.  Introduction

   Scheduling Function Zero (SF0) [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-sf0] enables on-
   the-fly cell scheduling (ADD/DELETE) between one-hop neighbors for
   aggregated (best-effort) traffic flows.  In other words, all the
   instances from nodeA to nodeB in Figure 1 are scheduled in a single
   L3-bundle (IP link).

                                   SF0.

   Some applications (e.g.  Industrial M2M) require end-to-end dedicated
   L2-bundles to support control/data streams for time-critical
   applications [I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases].  For such applications, the
   sender can reserve a dedicated track to the receiver for each
   isolated instance.  A track is actually a succession of paired
   L2-bundles (a receive bundle at the downstream node and a transmit
   bundle at the upstream node), which is identified by a global
   TrackID.  Per-instance L2-bundles need to be scheduled hop-by-hop in
   between sender and receiver [I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture].  In
   addition, cells in the scheduled end-to-end track of each instance
   may have to be dynamically adapted for bursty time-critical traffic
   flows.  With one-hop based SF0 cell scheduling, it is difficult to
   schedule dedicated end-to-end cells for isolated traffic flows.
   Moreover, global bandwidth estimation through Resource Reservation
   protocol is required for bandwidth allocation in multi-hop cell
   scheduling.  This draft specifies a Scheduling Function One (SF1) to
   schedule end-to-end dedicated L2-bundles for each instance, and to
   dynamically adapt the cells in already scheduled L2-bundles through
   RSVP-TE (see Figure 2).

2.  Operation of Scheduling Function One (SF1)

   SF1 is a combination of RSVP-TE and 6P (the 6top protocol
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-protocol]).  According to the bandwidth and QoS
   requirements of traffic flows, SF1 can schedule, reserve and label
   L2-bundles of cells at each hop, build up an end-to-end track
   identified by a global TrackID, and dynamically adapt the cells in an
   existing track.

   Using SF1, the Sender determines when to reserve end-to-end
   resources.  The following events may trigger the use of SF1:

   o The Sender has an outgoing bandwidth requirement for a new instance
   to transmit data to Receiver.

   o The Sender has a new outgoing bandwidth requirement for an existing
   instance to transmit data to Receiver.

   In both cases, distributed RSVP-TE is used to provide end-to-end
   resource reservations along with scheduling operations.  The outcome
   of RSVP-TE is a label switching path (LSP) [RFC3209].  In the context
   of this draft, a track is actually an LSP, in which the label at each
   hop is associated to the reserved cells.  And the TrackID is
   equivalent to the LSP_ID.

   It is assumed that an end-to-end route path is already available, for
   instance by using AODV-RPL [I-D.ietf-roll-aodv-rpl] routing.  To
   initiate the track reservation, the sender sends the RSVP-PATH
   message to the receiver along the route.  The PATH message describes
   the characteristics of the traffic flow and gathers information along
   the route to help the receiver(s) construct an appropriate
   reservation request [RFC2205].  Upon arrival of the PATH message, the
   receiver sends an RSVP-RESV message upstream to the sender.  At each
   hop, the cells to be reserved are negotiated between 2 neighbors with
   the help of 6P transactions.  If one-hop reservation succeeds, the
   downstream node assigns a label, which is associated to the selected
   cells, to the upstream node.  And the label is also associated to the
   track whose TrackID is encapsulated in the FILTER_SPEC of the RESV
   message.  If one-hop reservation fails at an intermediate node, the
   node SHOULD send a ResvErr message to the receiver and all the nodes
   along the downstream route to tear down the reserved resources.  When
   the RESV message arrives at the sender before the end-to-end timeout,
   an end-to-end track is built successfully.  If no RESV message is
   received at the sender when timeout, the track reservation fails.

   The end-to-end data transmission is achieved through Track Forwarding
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture] that can be seen as a G-MPLS operation
   in which the explicit label at each hop is associated to an implicit
   label, i.e., the reserved cells.  When transmitting data, the sender
   identifies the track to be used based on Sender and Receiver IP
   addresses and RPLInstanceID of the packet.  At each hop, the packet
   is transmitted using the reserved L2-bundle of cells on this track.

2.2.  One-hop Operation

   Upon arrival of the PATH message at an application receiver, the
   SENDER_TSPEC and ADSPEC objects are utilized to select the resource
   reservation parameters in FLOWSPEC of the RESV message.  Since RSVP
   provides receiver initiated resource reservation setup, the
   scheduling operation proceeds upstream from receiver to sender.  In
   6P the resources are represented as cells, thus the bandwidth can be
   interpreted as the number of cells, and the QoS can be interpreted as
   the constraints on cells, e.g. the priority of slotframe, the
   slotOffset and channelOffset of cells.  Therefore, the bandwidth and
   QoS parameters in FLOWSPEC need to be mapped to number and
   constraints of cells in the 6P transaction.

   In this document, when there are two neighbor nodes, the upstream
   node is named Node A, and the downstream node is named Node B.  If
   Node B is the receiver, the cell reservation is initiated by the
   arrival of a PATH message.  If node B is an intermediate node, the
   reservation is initiated by the arrival of an RESV message from
   downstream.  The cell reservation begins with 6P transactions, which
   can be 3-step or 2-step [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-protocol].  The
   operation of RESV message with these two kinds of transactions is
   specified as follows.

2.2.1.  3-step transaction

   As illustrated in Figure 6, Node B first determines whether it can
   provide enough qualified cells to receive traffic from Node A,
   according to the parameters in FLOWSPEC.  If not, Node B SHOULD send
   a ResvErr message.  Otherwise, Node B transmits a 6P Request message
   to Node A with the slotFrame_ID in the metadata field.  The type of
   the Request message (ADD or DELETE) is decided by comparing the the
   required cells and the currently reserved cells.  In a 3-step

Internet-Draft        draft-satish-6tisch-6top-sf1          October 2017


   transaction, the "CellList" field in the 6P request SHOULD be empty.
   The timeout for the 6P transaction is as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-protocol].  Node A checks the associated
   slotframe and proposes a candidate CellList.  Then a 6P Response
   message is sent back to Node B.  If Node B is able to select expected
   number of cells in this candidate CellList, it sends an RESV message
   to Node A, in which the 6P Confirmation message indicating the
   selected cells is encapsulated as the 6P OPERATION object, and the
   label is assigned as defined in Section 3.2.  Otherwise, the Node B
   can choose to initiate another 6P transaction on another slotframe
   which can fulfill the QoS requirement.  If all the 6P transactions
   fail, Node B SHOULD send a ResvErr message all the way to the
   receiver to tear down all the reserved resources.  When the RESV
   message arrives at Node A, the L2-bundle between Node A and Node B is
   installed.

   As illustrated in Figure 7, Node B SHOULD provide a candidate
   CellList which can fulfill the requirements in the 6P Request
   message, then Node A sends back the 6P Response message with a
   selected CellList.  If the number of cells in the selected CellList
   is what Node B expects, Node B sends an RESV message to Node A
   including an assigned label and without the 6P OPERATION object.  The

2.3.  Reroute and Bandwidth Increase mechanism

   Whenever the sender needs to establish a new tunnel that can maintain
   resource reservations without double counting (at any particular
   intermediate node) the resources with an existing tunnel, then the
   "RSVP reroute mechanism" is initiated [RFC3209].  With this
   operation, bandwidth can be increased or decreased end-to-end in the
   tunnel.  The detailed explanation of the reroute mechanism is
   explained in [RFC3209].

2.4.  Error Codes

   The detailed explanation of PathErr and ResvErr with different
   ERROR_SPEC to handle Scheduling and 6P operation errors will be
   described in later specification.

3.1.  RSVP-PATH message

   The basic RSVP-PATH message [RFC2205] is used to carry the "Sender
   Traffic Specification" along with "characterization parameters" from
   sender to receiver.  Since RSVP treats objects as opaque data, it is
   permissible to use another protocol element (e.g.  GMPLS, 6P, SF1) as
   an object in a RSVP-PATH message.

   The format of the PATH message that supports 6tisch scheduling
   capabilities (6P and SF1) is as follows:

   <Path Message> ::=    <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ]
                         [ [<MESSAGE_ID_ACK> | <MESSAGE_ID_NACK> ] ... ]
                         [ <MESSAGE_ID> ]
                         <SESSION> <RSVP_HOP>
                         <TIME_VALUES>
                         [ <EXPLICIT_ROUTE> ]
                         <LABEL_REQUEST>
                         [ <SF1 OPERATION REQUEST> ]
                         [ <6P OPERATION REQUEST> ]
                         [ <SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> ]
                         [ <NOTIFY_REQUEST> ]
                         [ <ADMIN_STATUS> ]
                         [ <POLICY_DATA> ... ]
                         <sender descriptor>

     <sender descriptor> ::=  <SENDER_TEMPLATE> <SENDER_TSPEC>
                              [ <ADSPEC> ]
                              [ <RECORD_ROUTE> ]

   The format of the Generalized Label Request Object in PATH message
   is:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |            Length             | Class-Num (19)|  C-Type (4)   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | LSP Enc. Type |Switching Type |             G-PID             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Generalized Label Request describes the requirement of
   communication characteristics to support the 6TiSCH-LSP being
   requested.  The Generalized Label Request object is set by the
   ingress node (6LR), transparently passed by transit nodes, and used
   by the egress node (6LR).

             +---------+-----------------------+------------+

   "SF1 OPERATION REQUEST" and "6P OPERATION REQUEST" are added in the
   PATH message to check for 6tisch scheduling capabilities within the
   intermediate nodes from sender to receiver.  The "Timeslot Switching
   Capability" (TSC) is used as an implicit label to switch the cell at
   intermediate nodes [RFC3473].  "LABEL_REQUEST" in path message should
   be set to "Timeslot Switching Capability".  If an intermediate node
   does not support the TSC or "6P transactions" or "SF1 operation" then
   it MUST send a "PathErr" message back to application.  At the sender,
   the combination of sender and receiver IP addresses and the
   RPLInstanceID is mapped to a 16-bit identifier.  The sender uses this
   identifier as the Track ID, and encapsulates it in the
   SENDER_TEMPLATE.

3.2.  RSVP-RESV message

   The basic RSVP-RESV messages [RFC2205] are transmitted upstream from
   receiver to sender to provide resource reservation as well as label
   distribution.  In this specification, hop-by-hop scheduling is
   extended to support both resource reservation and label distribution.
   The current specification is only defined for unicast point-to-point
   traffic flows, i.e., Fixed Filter (FF) reservation style.

   The format of the RESV message that supports 6tisch scheduling
   capabilities (6P and SF1) is as follows:

<Resv Message> ::= <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ]
                         [ [<MESSAGE_ID_ACK> | <MESSAGE_ID_NACK> ] ... ]
                         [ <MESSAGE_ID> ]
                         <SESSION> <RSVP_HOP>
                         <TIME_VALUES>
                         [ <6P OPERATION> ]
                         [ <RESV_CONFIRM> ]  [ <SCOPE> ]
                         [ <NOTIFY_REQUEST> ]
                         [ <ADMIN_STATUS> ]
                         [ <POLICY_DATA> ... ]
                         <STYLE> <flow descriptor list>

     <flow descriptor list> ::= <FF flow descriptor>
     <FF flow descriptor> ::= [ <FLOWSPEC> ] <FILTER_SPEC> <LABEL>
     [ <RECORD_ROUTE> ]

   The 6P OPERATION object encapsulates the 6P message.  The tuple
   (slotFrame_ID, CellList) indicating the reserved cells is mapped to a
   32-bit unsigned integer, which is used as the label to be assigned to
   the upstream node.  The format of the LABEL object (in the flow
   descriptor) conforms to the Type 1 Label defined in [RFC3473].

4.  Scheduling Function Identifier

   The Scheduling Function Identifier (SFID) of SF1 is
   IANA_SFID_SF1(TBD).

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new Scheduling Function
   (IANA_SFID_SF1) from the SF space of Scheduling Functions defined in
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-sf0]
