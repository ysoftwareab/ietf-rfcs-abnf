      Load-i: Load Index at Site-i, it is the weighted
      combination of the total packets or/and bytes sent to
      and received from the Application Server at Site-i
      during a fixed time period.

      CP-i: capacity index at the site I, higher value means
      higher capacity.

      Network Delay-i: Network latency measurement (RTT) to
      the A-ER that has the Application Server attached at the
      site-i.
      Noted: Ingress nodes can easily measure RTT to all the
      egress nodes by existing IPPM metrics. But it is not so
      easy for ingress nodes to measure RTT to all the App
      Servers. Therefore, "Network-Delay-i", a.k.a. Network
      latency measurement (RTT), is between the Ingress nodes
      and egress nodes. The link cost between the egress nodes
      to their attached servers are embedded in the "capacity
      index".

      Pref-i: Preference index for the site-i, higher value
      means higher preference.

      w: Weight for load and site information, which is a
      value between 0 and 1. If smaller than 0.5, Network
      latency and the site Preference have more influence;
