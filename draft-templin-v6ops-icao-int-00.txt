                    draft-templin-v6ops-icao-int-00

Abstract

   The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is building a
   worldwide IPv6-based Air Traffic Management (ATM) service known as
   the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network with Internet Protocol
   Services (ATN/IPS).  Aircraft connect to the ATN/IPS via an IPv6 Air/
   Ground (A/G) interface that provides a nexus for control and data
   messages exchanges over all available aviation wireless data links.
   This document discusses the use case that motivates a new IPv6
   interface abstraction.

1.  Introduction

   The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is building a
   worldwide IPv6-based Air Traffic Management (ATM) service known as
   the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network with Internet Protocol
   Services (ATN/IPS).  Aircraft connect to the ATN/IPS via an Air/
   Ground (A/G) interface that provides a nexus for control and data
   message exchanges over all available underlying aviation wireless
   data links.  Aircraft frequently have many data links and use them
   according to inbound and outbound traffic engineering profiles in a
   service known as multilink.

   As an aircraft travels, it's underlying aviation data link profile
   may change dynamically.  For example, data links that are available
   in the ground domain may not be available at cruise altitudes, and
   terrestrial cellular services may not be available during trans-
   oceanic crossings.  In still other cases, handoffs within the same
   access technology could result in readdressing.  For these reasons,
   aircraft and the ATN/IPS must be able to accommodate mobility.

   The ATN/IPS provides an IPv6 /32 Mobility Service Prefix (MSP), and
   ICAO further assigns each aircraft a 24-bit Identification value that
   is unique among all civil aviation aircraft worldwide.  From these
   two values, the aircaft constructs a /56 Mobile Network Prefix (MNP)
   that travels with the aircraft wherever it goes.  For example, if the
   MSP is 2001:db8::/32 and the aircraft is assiged the Identification
   value 0x123456, the resulting MNP is 2001:db8:1234:5600::/56.

   Each aircraft registers its MNP in the ATN/IPS ground-domain mobility
   service over its active aviation data links.  Since many aviation

   data links have very low-end performance profiles (e.g., 32Kbps) it
   is imperative that the MNP is conveyed in the fewest possible
   messages and with the smallest possible message sizes.  This service
   is termed "prefix registration" (as opposed to "prefix delegation")
   since the aircraft already knows its MNP and is simply asking for it
   to be registered in the ATN/IPS routing system.

   Following prefix registration, the aircraft sends IPv6 data messages
   over the A/G interface and undelying data links according to its
   traffic engineering profile.  The aircraft keeps the number of
   control messages to a minimum, since the ground domain is responsible
   for any keepalive messaging on behalf of the aircraft.  In this way,
   reducing contol message overhead on aviation data links presents the
   greatest possible capacity for carrying actual data.

   While the ground domain ATN/IPS network will provide a mobility
   service, the details of the service need not be exposed to the
   aircraft.  Instead, the aircraft simply operates its A/G interface in
   a manner that allows optimum data plane usage while providing the
   ground domain with only the necessary and sufficient control message
   signaling.  This document therefore presents a use case for an
   aircraft A/G interface.

2.  Terminology

   The terminology in the normative references applies; especially, the
   terms "link" and "interface" are the same as defined in the IPv6
   [RFC8200] and IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) [RFC4861] specifications.

   The following terms are defined for the purposes of this document:

   International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
      The global governing body for civil aviation standards.

   Air Traffic Management (ATM)
      A command and control messaging service for coordinating safe
      aviation operations.

   Aeronautical Telecommunciations Network with Internet Protocol
   Services (ATN/IPS)
      A proposed worldwide IPv6-based network used to enable ATM
      services between aircraft and air traffic controllers.

   multilink
      The ability of an aircraft to coordinate its available aviation
      data links through traffic engineering link selections.

   mobility
