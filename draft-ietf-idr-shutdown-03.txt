1.  Introduction

   It can be troublesome for an operator to correlate a BGP-4 [RFC4271]
   session teardown in the network with a notice that was transmitted
   via off-line methods such email or telephone calls.  This document
   specifies a mechanism to transmit a short freeform UTF-8 [RFC3629]
   message as part of a Cease NOTIFICATION message [RFC4486] to inform
   the peer why the BGP session is being shutdown.

2.  Shutdown Communication

   If a BGP speaker decides to terminate its session with a BGP
   neighbor, then the BGP speaker MAY send to the neighbor a
   NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code "Cease" and the Error
   Subcode "Administrative Shutdown" followed by a length field and an
   UTF-8 encoded string.  The contents of the string are at the
   operator's discretion.

   The Cease NOTIFICATION message with an Administrative Shutdown
   Communication is encoded as below:

   \                                                               \

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Length:  this 8-bit field represents the length of the Shutdown
      Communication field in octets.  The length value MUST range from 0
      to 128 inclusive.  When the length value is zero, no Shutdown
      Communication field follows.

   Shutdown Communication:  to support international characters, the
      Shutdown Communication field MUST be encoded using UTF-8.  A
      receiving BGP speaker MUST NOT interpret invalid UTF-8 sequences.
      Note that when the Shutdown Communication contains multibyte
      characters, the number of characters will be less than the length
      value.

   Mechanisms concerning the reporting of information contained in the
   Shutdown Communication are implementation specific but SHOULD include
   methods such as SYSLOG [RFC5424].

3.  Operational Considerations

   Operators are encouraged to use the Shutdown Communication to inform
   their peers of the reason for the shutdown of the BGP session and
   include out-of-band reference materials.  An example of a useful
   Shutdown Communication would be:

   "[TICKET-1-1438367390] software upgrade, back in 2 hours"

   "[TICKET-1-1438367390]" is a ticket reference with significance to
   both the sender and receiver, followed by a brief human readable
   message regarding the reason for the BGP session shutdown followed by
   an indication about the length of the maintenance.  The receiver can
   now use the string 'TICKET-1-1438367390' to search in their email
   archive to find more details.

4.  Error Handling

   Any erroneous or malformed Shutdown Communication received SHOULD be
   logged for the attention of the operator and then MAY be discarded.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Per this document, IANA is requested to reference this document at
   subcode "Administrative Shutdown" in the "Cease NOTIFICATION message
   subcodes" registry under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
   Parameters" group in addition to [RFC4486].

6.  Security Considerations

   This document uses UTF-8 encoding for the Shutdown Communication.
   There are a number of security issues with UNICODE.  Implementers and
   operator are advised to review UNICODE TR36 [UTR36] to learn about
   these issues.  This document guards against the technical issues
   outlined in UTR36 by REQUIRING "shortest form" encoding.  However,
   the visual spoofing due to character confusion still persists.  This
   specification minimizes the effects of visual spoofing by limiting
   the length of the Shutdown Communication.

   Users of this mechanism should be aware that unless a transport that
   provides integrity (such as TCP-AO [RFC5925]) is used for the BGP
   session in question, a Shutdown Communication message could be
   forged.  Unless a transport that provides confidentiality (such as
   IPSec [RFC4303]) is used, a Shutdown Communication message could be
   snooped by an attacker.  These issues are common to any BGP message
   but may be of greater interest in the context of this proposal since
   the information carried in the message is generally expected to be
   used for human-to-human communication.

7.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC7942.  The
   description of implementations in this section is intended to assist
   the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
   Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here
   does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has
   been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied
   by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not be
   construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   As of today these vendors have produced an implementation of the
   Shutdown Communication:

   o  ExaBGP [1]
   o  pmacct [2]
