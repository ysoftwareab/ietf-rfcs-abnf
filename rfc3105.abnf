   from one realm on behalf of a client in another realm.

   #If the server supports load balancing, this attribute should be
   #set to an integer from 0 to 100.  0 is the lowest indication of
   #load and 100 the highest.  Clients can query for this attribute
   #and obtain load information, from which they can make an
   #intelligent decision about which server to use.
