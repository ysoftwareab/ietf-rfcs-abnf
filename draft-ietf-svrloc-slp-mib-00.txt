Abstract

   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for the Service
   Location Protocol (SLP). The MIB describes the statistics and alerts
   required to allow management of Service Location Protocol enabled
   entities.  The SLP MIB conforms to the Structure of Management
   Information (SMI), as described in RFC 1902.  It is intended for use
   with the Simple Network Management Protocol, version 2.

1. Overview

   The Service Location Protocol provides a scalable framework for
   the discovery and selection of network services.  Using this
   protocol, computers using the Internet no longer need so much static
   configuration of network services for network based applications.

   The SLP MIB describes a set of attributes for managing the deployment
   of SLP directory agents.  SLP directory agents that implement this
   MIB can be monitored to determine the usefulness of configured
   scopes, frequency of error conditions, and various mis-configuration
   and performance issues.


2. The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework presently consists of three
   major components.  They are:

   - the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1] - the mechanisms used for
   describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

Internet Draft          Schemas and Templates           21 November 1997


   - the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] - the core set of managed objects
   for the Internet suite of protocols.

   - the protocol, STD 15, RFC 1157 [3] and/or RFC 1905 [4], - the
   protocol for accessing managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.


3. Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI. In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify
   a specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.


3.1. Configuration Group

   The first group defined in the SLP MIB is a configuration group.
   This group describes the current operating parameters of an SLP
   enabled entity.  The elements included in this group describe how the
   entity loaded its configuration parameters, as well as the operating
   values.  This includes the list of known scopes, multicast TTL and
   how long the entity has been operating.


3.2. Request Statistics Group

   The request statistics group collects statistics about the overall
   operation of a Service Location Protocol directory agent.  Statistics
   are collected across all scopes this entity is configured to operate
   within.  The attributes in this group track both incomming request
   statistics as well as outgoing replies and any errors the two
   operations may generate.


3.3. Scoped Request Table

   The request statistics group, described in the previous section,
   provides a high level view of a directory agent's operation.  In
   order to manage deployment of multiple directory agents the SLP MIB
   provides a ``scope indexed'' table of request activity.  This table

   is needed to determine which scopes may be overloading an agent,
   making them good candidates for deploying on alternate directory
   agents, elsewhere in the network.


3.4. Last Processed Request

   The last processed request group contains information about the last
   request that has been processed by a directory agent.  This group
   is needed to provide accurate information when an error occurs.  It
   may be used directly by network managers, though it is designed
   for inclusion within error reports, as discussed in the following
   section.


3.5. Alerts

   Only one alert is currently defined.  This alert is generated when a
   directory agent is unable to correctly parse an incomming request.
   After a parse error has occurred, an event notification is generated,
   containing information about the originator and type of the offending
   request, assuming they can be determined.
