INTERNET-DRAFT 		Benchmarking Terminology for		February 2003
           		    IGP Route Convergence

   1. Introduction
   This draft describes the terminology for benchmarking IGP Route 
   Convergence.  The motivation and applicability for this 
   benchmarking is provided in [1].  The methodology to be used for 
   this benchmarking is described in [2].  The methodology and 
   terminology to be used for benchmarking route convergence can be 
   applied to any link-state IGP such as ISIS [3] and OSPF [4].  The 
   data plane is measured to obtain the convergence benchmarking metrics.  
   The purpose of this document is to introduce new terms required to 
   complete execution of the IGP Route Convergence Methodology [2].

   2.  Existing definitions

   For the sake of clarity and continuity this RFC adopts the template
   for definitions set out in Section 2 of RFC 1242.  Definitions are
   indexed and grouped together in sections for ease of reference.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

   3. Term definitions

   3.1 Network Convergence  

	Definition:
	The completion of updating of all routing tables, including the 
	FIB, in all routers throughout the network.

	Discussion:
	Network Convergence can be approximated to the sum of Route 
        Convergence for all routers in the network.  Network Convergence 
	can only be determined by the occurrence of packet loss or stale 
	forwarding due to an out-of-date FIB.

	Measurement Units:
	Converged or Not Converged

	Issues:
	None

	See Also:
	Protocol Convergence
	Route Convergence

           		    IGP Route Convergence

   3.2 Protocol Convergence 

	Definition:
	The completion of updating a router's RIB and the forwarding of 
	an route update message (LSA for OSPF/LSP for ISIS) to a 
	neighboring peer.

	Discussion:
	Protocol Convergence considers only the Control Plane.  IGP 
	messaging is used to verify and measure convergence.  Updating 
	of the FIB, hardware updating, rerouting of traffic, and packet 
	loss are not considered. 

	Measurement Units:
	LSA/LSP Transmitted or LSA/LSP Not Transmitted.

	Issues:
	Protocol Convergence does not consider updating  of the FIB, 
	hardware updating, rerouting of traffic, and resultant packet 
	loss.  Protocol Convergence is only a partial measurement of 
	Route Convergence. 

	See Also:
	Network Convergence
	Route Convergence
 

   3.3 Route Convergence

	Definition:
	The completion of the router's FIB becoming fully converged.

	Discussion:
	All components of the router have been updated with the most 
	recent route change(s) including the RIB and FIB, along with 
	software and hardware tables. Route Convergence can be observed 
	externally by the rerouting of data traffic.

	Measurement Units:
	Converged or Not Converged

	Issues:
	None

	See Also:
	Route Convergence Time
	Network Convergence
	Protocol Convergence

   3.4  Peak-to-Peak Route Convergence Time

	Definition:
	The amount of time it takes for Route Convergence to 
	complete as measured by the time to drop from maximum 
	forwarding rate and return to maximum forwarding rate
	after occurrence of a network event. 

	Discussion:
	Peak-to-Peak Route Convergence Time is a metric applied 
	to a single router.  Convergence Time could be calculated 
	from packet loss.  However, this will give a better than 
	actual result when converging many routes simultaneously.  
	The preferred method to obtain Route Convergence Time is 
	to measure the time to drop from maximum forwarding rate 
	and return to maximum forwarding rate.  

	Figure 1 shows a graph model of Convergence Time as measured 
	from the data plane.  IGP Route Convergence Time is the 
	amount of time for the Forwarding Rate to begin its downward 
	slope upon occurrence of a network event and then fully recover 
	to the Maximum Forwarding Rate.  This is calculated as 
	
	(eq 1)	Time(Convergence) = Time(Recovery) - Time(Network Event).

   3.5 Route Convergence Packet Loss

	Definition:
	The amount of packet loss until Route Convergence completes.

	Discussion:
	Route Convergence Packet Loss is used to calculate the
	Route Convergence Time.  Packet loss is an externally 
	measurable metric.

	Measurement Units:
	number of packets

	Issues:
	None

	See Also:
	Route Convergence
	Peak-to-Peak Route Convergence Time
	Route Convergence Event Slope
	Route Convergence Recovery Slope


   3.6 Calculated Route Convergence Time

	Definition:
	The amount of time it takes for Route Convergence to 
	complete as calculated from the amount of packet loss
	and known forwarding rate.

	Discussion:
	Calculated Route Convergence Time is a metric applied to a 
	single router.  It can be calculated from packet loss that 
	occurs due to a network event and subsequent Route 
	Convergence.  

	Measurement Units:
	seconds/milliseconds

	Issues:
	Use of Packet loss to calculate Route Convergence Time will 
	give a better than actual result when converging many routes 
	simultaneously.  Peak-to-Peak Route Convergence Time is 
	the preferred benchmark for IGP Route Convergence.

  3.7 Route Convergence Event Slope

	Definition:
	The characteristic of routers in which forwarding rate
	gradually reaches zero as output queues drain after a 
	network event.

	Discussion:
	Route Convergence Event Slope is externally observable.  
	Peak-to-Peak Route Convergence Time ignores the Route 
	Convergence Event Slope.  Calculated Route Convergence 
	Time based upon the amount of packet loss takes the
	Route Convergence Event Slope into account.

	Measurement Units:
	seconds/milliseconds

	Issues:
	None

	See Also:
	Route Convergence
	Peak-to-Peak Route Convergence Time
	Calculated Route Convergence Time
	Route Convergence Packet Loss
	Route Convergence Recovery Slope

   3.8 Route Convergence Recovery Slope
	Definition:
	The characteristic of routers in which forwarding rate
	gradually rises to the maximum value as many routes 
	converge to recover from a network event.

	Discussion:
	Route Convergence Recovery Slope is externally observable.  
	Peak-to-Peak Route Convergence Time ignores the Route 
	Convergence Recovery Slope.  Calculated Route Convergence 
	Time based upon the amount of packet loss takes the
	Route Convergence Recovery Slope into account.

	Measurement Units:
	seconds/milliseconds

	Issues:
	None

	See Also:
	Route Convergence
	Peak-to-Peak Route Convergence Time
	Calculated Route Convergence Time
	Route Convergence Packet Loss

   3.9  Reroute Convergence Time
	Definition:
	The amount of time it takes for Route Convergence to 
	complete as observed from rerouting of traffic to a
	new egress interface.

	Discussion:
	Reroute Convergence Time is the IGP Route Convergence
	benchmark to be used for network events that produce
	a change in next-hop without packet loss.  An example 
	of this is a cost change in which an backup path becomes 
	the preferred path.

	Measurement Units:
	seconds/milliseconds

	Issues:
	None

	Peak-to-Peak Route Convergence Time

   3.10 Local Interface
	Definition:
	An interface on the DUT.

	Discussion:
	None

	Measurement Units:
	N/A

	Issues:
	None

	See Also:
	Neighbor Interface
	Remote interface


   3.11 Neighbor Interface

	Definition:
	The interface on the neighbor router or tester that is 
	directly linked to the DUT's Local Interface.

	Discussion:
	None

	Measurement Units:
	N/A

   3.12 Remote Interface

	Definition:
	An interface on a neighboring router that is not directly 
	linked to any interface on the DUT.

	Discussion:
	None

	Measurement Units:
	N/A

	Issues:
	None

	See Also:

   4. Security Considerations

        Documents of this type do not directly effect the security of
        the Internet or of corporate networks as long as benchmarking
        is not performed on devices or systems connected to operating
        networks.
