Internet-Draft      SAVA Mobile IP Problem Statement           June 2007


1.  Introduction

   In the current SAVA BOF proposal[SAVA-FRAMEWORK], the architecture is
   categorized into three type of defense: "First-hop, local subnet
   source validation", "Intra-AS Communication of SAVA validation", and
   "Inter-AS Communication of SAVA validation."

   In the current Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344]specification, during the mobile
   Foreign Agent Care of Address model, reverse tunneling based
   mechanism could be used in case of ingress filtering[RFC2827], but it
   will constraint application where foreign agent could forward packet
   directly.

   When routing packets are directly sent to the mobile node, the
   correspondent node sets the Destination Address in the IPv6 header to
   the care-of address of the mobile node.  A new type of IPv6 routing
   header [RFC3775] is also added to the packet to carry the desired
   home address.  Similarly, the mobile node sets the Source Address in
   the packet's IPv6 header to its current care-of addresses.  The
   mobile node adds a new IPv6 "Home Address" destination option to
   carry its home address.  The inclusion of home addresses in these
   packets makes use of the care-of address transparent above the
   network layer.

   When the mobile node sends packets directly to the correspondent
   node, the Source Address field of the packet's IPv6 header is the
   care-of address.  Therefore, ingress filtering works in the usual
   manner even for mobile nodes, as the Source Address is topologically
   correct. which is intended for ingress filter during access network.
   The Home Address option is used to inform the correspondent node of
   the mobile node's home address.

   This document defines a problem with SAVA related to Mobile IP.

2.  Terminology

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terminology used
   in [RFC1654], [RFC2827].  In addition, the following terms are
   defined:

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

3.  Problems about Mobile IPv4 FA-CoA Model

   Many routers implement security policies such as "ingress filtering"
   that do not allow forwarding of packets that have a Source Address
   which appears topologically incorrect.  Current Mobile IPv4 support
   reverse tunneling [RFC3024] with the foreign agent supplied care-of
   address as the Source Address. but it will lead to all traffic have
   to go through the home agent even foreign agent is located far away
   from home agent,

   In this network architecture, as the below Figure 1, if the Host A MN
   wants to communicate with Host B CN, if there is no ingress filter
   after foreign agent, and if Mobile IPv4 Foreign Agent Care of Address
   mode is adopted, source address of packets initiated from mobile node
   would be mobile node's home address, but if ingress filter is
   supported in the router after foreign agent, then source address is
   mobile node's home address, but it would distort the network
   architecture.  Mobile IPv4 adopt reverse tunneling [RFC3024] to
   support tunneling between foreign agent and home agent which source
   address is care of address.

4.  Problem statement about Mobile IPv6 Destination Option and Type 2
    Routing Header

   When routing packets are sent directly to the mobile node, the
   correspondent node sets the Destination Address in the IPv6 header to
   the care-of address of the mobile node.  A new type of IPv6 routing
   header [RFC3775] is also added to the packet to carry the desired
   home address.  Similarly, the mobile node sets the Source Address in
   the packet's IPv6 header to its current care-of addresses.  The
   mobile node adds a new IPv6 "Home Address" destination option to
   carry its home address.  The inclusion of home addresses in these
   packets makes use of the care-of address transparent above the
   network layer.

   When the mobile node sends packets directly to the correspondent
   node, the Source Address field of the packet's IPv6 header is the
   care-of address.  Therefore, ingress filtering works in the usual
   manner even for mobile nodes, as the Source Address is topologically
   correct. which is intended for ingress filter during access network.
   The Home Address option is used to inform the correspondent node of
   the mobile node's home address.

   In this network architecture, as the Figure 2, if care of address of
   mobile node does not belong to SAVA alliance, but home address of
   mobile node belongs to SAVA Alliance, this packet would be discarded
   according to SAVA policy, but network operator may not expect this
   happen, they also expect that mobile node where home address belongs
   to alliance still could visit Host B. even .
