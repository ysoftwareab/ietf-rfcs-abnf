1.  Introduction

   This memo describes an RTP Payload format for the Society of Motion
   Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) Ancillary data (ANC), as
   defined by SMPTE ST 291-1 [ST291].  ANC can carry a range of data
   types, including time code, Closed Captioning, and the Active Format
   Description (AFD).

   ANC is generally associated with the carriage of metadata within the
   bit stream of a Serial Digital Interface (SDI) such as SMPTE ST 259
   [ST259], the standard definition (SD) Serial Digital Interface (with
   ANC data inserted as per SMPTE ST 125 [ST125]), or SMPTE ST 292-1
   [ST292], the 1.5 Gb/s Serial Digital Interface for high definition
   (HD) television applications.

   ANC data packet payload definitions for a specific application are
   specified by a SMPTE Standard, Recommended Practice, Registered
   Disclosure Document, or by a document generated by another
   organization, a company, or an individual (an Entity).  When a
   payload format is registered with SMPTE, an application document
   describing the payload format is required, and the registered
   ancillary data packet is identified by a registered data
   identification word.

   This memo describes an RTP payload that supports ANC data packets
   regardless of whether they originate from an SD or HD interface, or
   if the ANC data packet is from the vertical ancillary space (VANC) or
   the horizontal ancillary space (HANC), or if the ANC packet is
   located in the luma (Y) or color-difference (C) channel.  Sufficient
   information is provided to enable the ANC packets at the output of

   the decoder to be restored to their original locations in the serial
   digital video signal raster (if that is desired).

   It should be noted that the ancillary data flag (ADF) word is not
   specifically carried in this RTP payload.  The ADF may be specified
   in a document defining an interconnecting digital video interface,
   otherwise a default ADF is specified by SMPTE ST 291-1 [ST291].

   This ANC payload can be used by itself, or used along with a range of
   RTP video formats.  In particular, it has been designed so that it
   could be used along with RFC 4175 [RFC4175] "RTP Payload Format for
   Uncompressed Video" or RFC 5371 [RFC5371] "RTP Payload Format for
   JPEG 2000 Video Streams."

   The data model in this document for the ANC data RTP payload is based
   on the data model of SMPTE ST 2038 [ST2038], which standardizes the
   carriage of ANC data packets in an MPEG-2 Transport Stream.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  RTP Payload Format for SMPTE ST 291 Ancillary Data

   The format of an RTP packet containing SMPTE ST 291 Ancillary Data is
   shown below:

             Figure 1: SMPTE Ancillary Data RTP Packet Format

   RTP packet header fields SHALL be interpreted as per RFC 3550
   [RFC3550], with the following specifics:

   Timestamp: 32 bits
           The timestamp field is interpreted in a similar fashion to
           RFC 4175 [RFC4175]:

           For progressive scan video, the timestamp SHALL denote the
           sampling instant of the frame to which the ancillary data in
           the RTP packet belongs.  Packets MUST NOT include ANC data
           from multiple frames, and all packets with ANC data belonging
           to the same frame MUST have the same timestamp.

           For interlaced video, the timestamp SHALL denote the sampling
           instant of the field to which the ancillary data in the RTP
           packet belongs.  Packets MUST NOT include ANC data from
           multiple fields, and all packets belonging to the same field
           MUST have the same timestamp.

           A 90-kHz timestamp SHOULD be used in both cases.  If the
           sampling instant does not correspond to an integer value of
           the clock, the value SHALL be truncated to the next lowest
           integer, with no ambiguity.

   Marker bit (M): 1 bit



Edwards                  Expires April 21, 2016                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload for Ancillary Data         October 2015


           The marker bit set to "1" SHALL indicate the last RTP packet
           containing ANC data for a frame (for progressive scan video)
           or the last RTP packet containing ANC data for a field (for
           interlaced video).

2.1.  Payload Header Definitions

   The ANC RTP payload header fields are defined as:

   Extended Sequence Number: 16 bits
           The high order bits of the extended 32-bit sequence number,
           in network byte order.  This is the same as the Extended
           Sequence Number field in RFC 4175 [RFC4175].

   Length: 16 bits
           Number of octets of the ANC RTP payload, beginning with the
           "C" bit of the first ANC packet data.

   ANC_Count: 8 bits
           This field is the count of the total number of ANC data
           packets carried in the RTP payload.  A single ANC RTP packet
           payload SHALL NOT carry more than 255 ANC data packets.
           If more than 255 ANC data packets need to be carried in a
           field or frame, additional RTP packets carrying ANC data may
           be sent with the same RTP timestamp but with different
           sequence numbers.

   For each ANC data packet in the payload, the following ANC data
   packet header fields MUST be present:

   C: 1 bit
           For HD signals, this flag, when set to "1", indicates that
           the ANC data corresponds to the color-difference channel (C).
           When set to "0", this flag indicates that the ANC data
           corresponds to the luma (Y) channel.  For SD signals, this
           flag SHALL be set to "0".

   Line_Number: 11 bits
           This field contains the line number (as defined in ITU-R
           BT.1700 [BT1700] for SD video or ITU-R BT.1120 [BT1120] for
           HD video) that corresponds to the location of the ANC data
           packet.  A value of 0x7FF (all bits in the field are '1')
           SHALL indicate that the ANC data is carried without a
           specific line location within the field or frame.

           Note that the lines that are available to convey ANC data are
           as defined in the applicable sample structure specification
           (e.g., SMPTE 274M [ST274], SMPTE ST 296 [ST296], ITU-R BT.656



Edwards                  Expires April 21, 2016                 [Page 5]

           [BT656]) and may be further restricted per SMPTE RP 168
           [RP168].

   Horizontal_Offset: 12 bits
           This field defines the location of the ANC packet relative to
           the start of active video (SAV).  A value of 0 means that the
           Ancillary Data Flag (ADF) of the ANC packet begins
           immediately following SAV.  For HD, this SHALL be in units of
           luma sample numbers as specified by the defining document of
           the particular image (e.g., SMPTE 274M [ST274] for 1920 x
           1080 active images, or SMPTE ST 296 [ST296] for 1280 x 720
           progressive active images).  For SD, this SHALL be in units
           of (27MHz) multiplexed word numbers, as specified in SMPTE ST
           125 [ST125].  A value of 0xFFF (all bits in the field are
           '1') SHALL indicate that the ANC data is carried without any
           specific location within the line.

           Note that HANC space in the digital blanking area will
           generally have higher luma sample numbers than any samples in
           the active digital line.

   An ANC packet with the header fields Line_Number of 0x7FF and
   Horizontal_Offset of 0xFFF SHALL be considered to be carried without
   any specific location within the field or frame, and in such a case
   the "C" field SHALL be ignored.

   For each ANC data packet in the payload, immediately after the ANC
   data packet header fields, the following data fields MUST be present,
   with the fields DID, SDID, Data_Count, User_Data_Words, and
   Checksum_Word representing the 10-bit words carried in the ANC data
   packet, as per SMPTE ST 291-1 [ST291]:

   DID: 10 bits
           Data Identification Word

   SDID: 10 bits
           Secondary Data Identification Word.  Used only for a "Type 2"
           ANC data packet.  Note that in a "Type 1" ANC data packet,
           this word will actually carry the Data Block Number (DBN).

   Data_Count: 10 bits
           The lower 8 bits of Data_Count, corresponding to bits b7
           (MSB) through b0 (LSB) of the 10-bit Data_Count word, contain
           the actual count of 10-bit words in User_Data_Words.  Bit b8
           is the even parity for bits b7 through b0, and bit b9 is the
           inverse (logical NOT) of bit b8.

   R: 2 reserved bits



Edwards                  Expires April 21, 2016                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload for Ancillary Data         October 2015


           R is a field of two reserved bits that MUST be set to zero.

   User_Data_Words: integer number of 10 bit words
           User_Data_Words (UDW) are used to convey information of a
           type as identified by the DID word or the DID and SDID words.
           The number of 10-bit words in the UDW is defined by the
           Data_Count field.

   Checksum_Word: 10 bits
           The Checksum_Word can be used to determine the validity of
           the ANC data packet from the DID word through the UDW.  It
           consists of 10 bits, where bits b8 (MSB) through b0 (LSB)
           define the checksum value and bit b9 is the inverse (logical
           NOT) of bit b8.  The checksum value is equal to the nine
           least significant bits of the sum of the nine least
           significant bits of the DID word, the SDID word, the
           Data_Count word, and all User_Data_Words in the ANC data
           packet.  The checksum is initialized to zero before
           calculation, and any end carry resulting from the checksum
           calculation is ignored.

   octet_align: 0-7 bits as needed to complete octet
           Octet align contains enough "0" bits as needed to complete
           the last octet of an ANC packet's data in the RTP payload.
           This ensures that the next ANC packet's data in the RTP
           payload begins octet-aligned despite ANC packets being made
           up of 10-bit words.  If an ANC data packet in the RTP payload
           ends aligned with an octet, there is no need to add any octet
           alignment bits.

   When reconstructing an SDI signal based on this payload, it is
   important to place ANC packets into the locations indicated by the
   ANC payload header fields Line_Number and Horizontal_Offset, and also
   to follow the requirements of SMPTE ST 291-1 [ST291] Section 7
   "Ancillary Data Space Formatting (Component or Composite Interface)",
   which include rules on the placement of initial ANC data into allowed
   spaces as well as the contiguity of ANC data packet sequences within
   those spaces in order to assure that the resulting ANC packets in the
   SDI signal are valid.

3.  Payload Format Parameters

   This RTP payload format is identified using the video/smpte291 media
   type, which is registered in accordance with RFC 4855 [RFC4855], and
   using the template of RFC 4288 [RFC4288].

   Note that the Media Type Definition is in the "video" tree due to the
   expected use of SMPTE ST 291 Ancillary Data with video formats.

3.1.  Media Type Definition

   Type name: video

   Subtype name: smpte291

   Required parameters:

      Rate: RTP timestamp clock rate.

   Optional parameters:

      DID_SDID: Data identification and Secondary data identification
      words.

      The presence of the DID_SDID parameters signals that all ancillary
      data packets of this stream are of a particular type or types,
      i.e., labeled with a particular DIDs and SDIDs.  The DID_SDID
      parameter consists of the DID and SDID values in that order
      separated by a comma, with the DID/SDID pair preceded by a '{' and
      followed by a '}'.

      DID and SDID values should be specified in hexadecimal with a "0x"
      prefix (such as "0x61").  For example, EIA 608 Closed Caption data
      would be signalled with the parameter DID_SDID={0x61,0x02}.  If
      DID_SDID is not specified, then the ancillary data stream may
      potentially contain ancillary data packets of any type.

      Multiple DID_SDID parameters may be specified (separated by
      semicolons) to signal the presence of multiple types of ANC data
      in the stream.  DID_SDID={0x61,0x02};DID_SDID={0x41,0x05}, for
      example, signals the presence of EIA 608 Closed Captions as well
      as AFD/Bar Data.

      DID and SDID values of SMPTE Registered ANC packet types can be
      found on the SMPTE Registry for Data Identification Word
      Assignments at:

      http://www.smpte-ra.org/S291/S291_reg.html

      DID and SDID values can be registered with SMPTE as per SMPTE ST
      291-1 [ST291].

   Encoding considerations: This media type is framed and binary; see
   Section 4.8 of RFC 4288 [RFC4288].

   Security considerations: See Section 5 of [this RFC]




Edwards                  Expires April 21, 2016                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload for Ancillary Data         October 2015


   Interoperability considerations: Data items in smpte291 can be very
   diverse.  Receivers might only be capable of interpreting a subset of
   the possible data items.  Some implementations may care about the
   location of the ANC data packets in the SDI raster, but other
   implementations may not care.

   Published specification: [this RFC]

   Applications that use this media type: Devices that stream real-time
   professional video, especially those that must interoperate with
   legacy serial digital interfaces (SDI).

   Additional Information: none

   Person & email address to contact for further information: T.
   Edwards <thomas.edwards@fox.com>, IETF Payload Working Group
   <payload@ietf.org>

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage: This media type depends on RTP framing, and
   hence is only defined for transfer via RTP RFC 3550 [RFC3550].
   Transport within other framing protocols is not defined at this time.

   Change controller: IETF Audio/Video Transport Payloads working group
   delegated from the IESG.

3.2.  Mapping to SDP

   The mapping of the above defined payload format media type and its
   parameters SHALL be done according to Section 3 of RFC 4855
   [RFC4855].

   o  The type name ("video") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   o  The subtype name ("smpte291") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the
      encoding name.

   o  The optional DID_SDID parameters go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute
      as a semicolon-separated list of parameter=value pairs.

   A sample SDP mapping for ancillary data is as follows:

   m=video 30000 RTP/AVP 112
   a=rtpmap:112 smpte291/90000
   a=fmtp:112 DID_SDID={0x61,0x02};DID_SDID={0x41,0x05}

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload for Ancillary Data         October 2015


   In this example, a dynamic payload type 112 is used for ancillary
   data.  The 90 kHz RTP timestamp rate is specified in the "a=rtpmap"
   line after the subtype.  The RTP sampling clock is 90 kHz.  In the
   "a=fmtp:" line, DID 0x61 and SDID 0x02 are specified (registered to
   EIA 608 Closed Caption Data by SMPTE), and also DID 0x41 and SDID
   0x05 (registered to AFD/Bar Data).

3.3.  Offer/Answer Model and Declarative Considerations

   When offering SMPTE ST 291 Ancillary data over RTP using the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) in an Offer/Answer model [RFC3264] or in a
   declarative manner (e.g., SDP in the Real-Time Streaming Protocol
   (RTSP) [RFC2326] or the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP)
   [RFC2974]), the offerer could provide a list of streams available
   with specific DID & SDIDs, and the answerer could specify which
   streams with specific DID & SDIDs it would like to accept.

4.  IANA Considerations

   One media type (video/smpte291) has been defined and needs
   registration in the media types registry.  See Section 3.1

5.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550] and any applicable RTP profile, e.g., AVP
   [RFC3551].

   To avoid potential buffer overflow attacks, receivers should take
   care to validate that the ANC packets in the RTP payload are of the
   appropriate length (using the Data_Count field) for the ANC data type
   specified by DID & SDID.  Also the Checksum_Word should be checked
   against the ANC data packet to ensure that its data has not been
   damaged in transit.

   Some receivers will simply move the ANC data packet bits from the RTP
   payload into a serial digital interface (SDI).  It may still be a
   good idea for these "re-embedders" to perform the above mentioned
   validity tests to avoid downstream SDI systems from becoming confused
   by bad ANC packets, which could be used for a denial of service
   attack.

   "Re-embedders" into SDI should also double check that the Line_Number
   and Horizontal_Offset leads to the ANC data packet being inserted
   into a legal area to carry ancillary data in the SDI video bit stream
   of the output video format.
