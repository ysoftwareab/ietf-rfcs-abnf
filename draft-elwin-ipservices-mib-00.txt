This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing networks using IP
Service Profiles.

4.0 Terminologies

    IP Service Profile
        An IP Service Profile contain the rules and specific
        configuration information for an IPSec, IP Qos, or
        Firewall services.


5.0 Introduction

This MIB is designed to help administrators to provision their IP
Services by using a uniform mechanism.


6.0  The SNMP Network Management Framework

The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
components:

  o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

  o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
     purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
     Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
     STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
     The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, which
     consists of RFC 2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].

  o  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
     first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
     described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version of the
     SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
     protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and
     RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is
     called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and
     RFC 2574 [12].

  o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
     first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
     described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of protocol
     operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905

     [13].

  o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14]
     and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC
     2575 [15].

A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
can be found in RFC 2570 [22].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
translation is possible (e.g., use of Counter64).  Some machine
readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual
descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this
loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the
semantics of the MIB.


7.0 Overview of the IP-SERVICES-MIB

The ipServicesIfTable provides a uniform mechanism for attaching
IP Services Profiles to the interfaces.  This is achieved specifying
the profile name for the appropriate interface.

To enable and disable the an IP Service Profile for the interface,
use the ipServicesIfSecurityEnabled, ipServicesIfQosEnabled,
or ipServicesIfFirewallEnabled objects.  By default the values
of these objects are false(2), meaning the profile is not enabled.


8.0  Sample IP Services MIB Configuration Scenario

To attach an IPSec Profile named "ipsec-phoenix1" on 
ipServicesIfIfIndex=2.

    SetRequest {
        ipServicesIfSecurityProfile.2     "ipsec-phoenix1"
    }

To enable the IPSec Profile on ipServicesIfIfIndex=2,

    SetRequest {
        ipServicesIfSecurityEnabled.2     true(1)
    }

draft-elwin-ipservices-mib-00          IP Services MIB          Feb 2002




To disable the IPSec Profile on ipServicesIfIfIndex=2,

    SetRequest {
        ipServicesIfSecurityEnabled.2     false(2)
    }
