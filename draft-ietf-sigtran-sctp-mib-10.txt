Abstract

   The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a reliable
   transport protocol operating on top of a connectionless packet
   network such as IP. It is designed to transport PSTN signaling
   messages over the connectionless packet network, but is capable of
   broader applications.

   This memo defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module which
   describes the minimum set of objects needed to manage the
   implementation of the SCTP.

INTERNET-DRAFT            SCTP MIB using SMIv2                June, 2003


   This memo defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module which
   describes managed objects for implementations of the SCTP.

   The document starts with a brief description of the SNMP framework
   and continues with the MIB explanation and security consideration
   sections among others.

   The managed objects in this MIB module are based on [RFC2012] update:
   "Management Information Base for the Transmission Control Protocol
   (TCP)" referred as [TCPMIB] (work in progress), and RFC 3291 "Textual
   Conventions for Internet Network Addresses" [RFC3291].

   Terms related to the SCTP architecture are explained in [RFC2960].
   Other specific abbreviations are listed below.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The main groups are explained further in the MIB definition.


3.1 SCTP Objets

   This branch contains the SCTP statistics and general parameters (both
   of them scalars) and the SCTP MIB tables.


3.1.1 SCTP Statistics

   The SCTP MIB includes both Counter32s and Counter64s to deal with
   statistics. Counter64s are used for those counters, which are likely
   to wrap around in less than one hour, according to [RFC2863].

   In addition Gauge32 is also used.


3.1.1.1 State-Related Statistics

   These statistics are based on the TCP model, but adapted to the SCTP
   states. They store the number of successful association attempts, how
   many associations have been initiated by the local or the remote SCTP
   layer, and the number of associations terminated in a graceful (by
   means of SHUTDOWN procedure) or ungraceful way (by means of CLOSE
   procedure).


3.1.1.2 Statistics for traffic Measurements

   This set of objects specifies statistics related to the whole SCTP
   layer. There are, e.g., statistics related to both SCTP packets and
   SCTP chunks.

   Statistics related to a specific association, or local/remote IP
   addresses are defined inside its associated table.



3.1.2 SCTP Parameters

   This section of the MIB contains the general variables for the
   SCTP protocol. Maximum, minimum, initial and default values are
   listed here.

INTERNET-DRAFT            SCTP MIB using SMIv2                June, 2003


   SCTP RTO mechanism definition is based on the TCP MIB [TCPMIB]. In
   SCTP, only options 'other' and 'vanj' are valid since SCTP defines
   Van Jacobson's algorithm (vanj) as the one to be used to calculate
   RTO. 'Other' is left for future use.


3.1.3 MIB Tables

   There are several tables included in the SCTP MIB. The first group
   deals with the SCTP association variables and is composed of a main
   and two extended tables. The second group is a bunch of tables used
   to perform reverse lookups.

   It is NOT possible to create rows in any table (sctpAssocTable,
   sctpAssocLocalAddrTable, sctpRemAddrTable and Reverse Lookup tables)
   using SNMP.

   It is NOT possible to delete rows in any table using SNMP except in
   sctpAssocTable under the particular conditions explained below.


3.1.3.1  Association Table

   The sctpAssocTable  is the main MIB table, where all the association
   related information is stored on a per association basis. It is
   structured according to expanded tables. The main table is called
   sctpAssocTable and is indexed by sctpAssocId (the association
   identification). This is a value that uniquely identifies an
   association. The MIB does not restrict what value must be written
   here, however it must be unique within the table.

   The sctpAssoc index is also shared by two more tables:
      -  sctpAssocLocalAddrTable: to store the local IP address(-es).
      -  sctpAssocRemAddrTable: to store the remote addresses and the
         per-remote-address related information.

   Entries in the sctpAssocTable are created when trying to establish
   the association, i.e., when sending the COOKIE-ECHO message
   (originating side) or the COOKIE-ACK message (server side). At this
   point, i.e., at established state, all entry fields are filled in
   with valid values.

   Note: The following representation is a conceptual mode of describing
   the relationship between the tables in this MIB. Note that the real
   relationship of the tables is by sharing an index, so tables are not
   truly within tables. Every entry is explained when defining the
   corresponding objects in the MIB.

                  +--(8) sctpAssocRemAddrStartTime







   Both sctpAssocLocalAddrTable and sctpAssocRemAddrTable are indexed by
   addresses. 'Addr' and 'AddrType' use the syntax InetAddress and
   InetAddressType defined in the Textual Conventions for Internet
   Network Address (RFC3291). The InetAddressType TC has codepoints for
   unknown, IPv4, IPv6, non-global IPv4, non-global IPv6, and DNS
   addresses, but only the IPv4 and IPv6 address types are required to
   be supported by implementations of this MIB module.  Implementations
   that connect multiple zones are expected to support the non-global
   IPv4 and non-global IPv6 address types as well.

   Note that DNS addresses are not used in this MIB module.  They are
   always resolved to the on-the-wire form prior to connection setup,
   and the on-the-wire form is what appears in the MIB objects.

   The sctpAssocLocalAddrTable table will have as many entries as local
   IP addresses have been defined for the association. The
   sctpAssocRemAddrTable table will contain as many entries as remote IP
   addresses are known to reach the peer. For the multihoming concept
   see reference RFC2960.

   To keep the name of the remote peer (when provided by the peer at
   initialization time), an entry has been created in the sctpAssocTable
   called sctpAssocRemHostName. When no DNS name is provided by the
   remote endpoint, this value will be NULL (zero-length string).
   Otherwise, the received DNS name will be stored here.

   If it is necessary to abort an existing association, the value
   deleteTCB(9) must be written in the variable sctpAssocState. That is
   the only way to delete rows in any of the mentioned tables.


3.1.3.2  Reverse Lookup Table

   There are five reverse lookup tables to help management applications
   efficiently access conceptual rows in other tables. These tables
   allow management applications to avoid expensive tree walks through
   large numbers of associations.

   All of these tables are optional. If these tables are implemented, an
   entry in them must be created after the entry in the main table
   (sctpAssocTable) associated with it has been created. This ensures
   that the field indexing the lookup table exists.

   The defined reverse lookup tables allow for performing a lookup using
   the following variables:

      -  Local Port: It allows a management application to find all the
         associations that use a specific local port
      -  Remote Port: It allows a management application to find all the
         associations that use a specific remote port
      -  Remote Host Name: It allows a management application to find
         all the associations with a specific host name.
      -  Remote Primary IP Address: It allows a management application
         to find all the associations that use a specific remote IP
         address as primary.
      -  Remote IP address: a management application to find all the
          associations that use a specific remote IP address.

   As an example the picture below shows the table to look up by local
   port.

   It is not possible for the operator to either create or delete rows
   in these tables. The rows in this table will dynamically appear and
   be removed as the corresponding entries in sctpAssocTable are.


3.2 Conformance

   The conformance section recommends as optional all the inverse lookup
   tables in this MIB. General layer and per association parameters and
   statistics are considered mandatory.

   IP addresses use the global IPv4 and global IPv6 address formats.
   Unknown value and DNS name formats are not used. Names, if present,
   are stored in the sctpRemoteHostName variable.

5. Compiling Notes

   When compiling the MIB module warnings similar to the following may
   occur:

      - warning: index of row `sctpAssocLocalAddrEntry' can exceed OID
        size limit by 141 subidentifier(s)
      - warning: index of row `sctpAssocRemAddrEntry' can exceed OID
        size limit by 141 subidentifier(s)

INTERNET-DRAFT            SCTP MIB using SMIv2                June, 2003


      - warning: index of row `sctpLookupRemHostNameEntry' can exceed
        OID size limit by 140 subidentifier(s)
      - warning: index of row `sctpLookupRemPrimIPAddrEntry' can exceed
        OID size limit by 141 subidentifier(s)
      - warning: index of row `sctpLookupRemIPAddrEntry' can exceed OID
        size limit by 141 subidentifier(s)

   These warnings are due to the fact that the row objects have index
   objects of type InetAddress or OCTET STRING whose size limit is 255
   octets, and if that size limit were reached the names of column
   instances in those rows would exceed the 128 sub-identifier limit
   imposed by current versions of the SNMP.  Actual limitations for the
   index object sizes are noted in the conceptual row DESCRIPTION
   clauses.  For the InetAddress index objects these size limits will
   not be reached with any of the address types in current use.

7. Security Considerations

   There are management objects defined in this MIB that have a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may
   be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
   The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
   These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o The sctpAssocState object has a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write,
   which allows termination of an arbitrary connection. Unauthorized
   access could cause a denial of service.




Pastor, Belinchon                                              [Page 42]

INTERNET-DRAFT            SCTP MIB using SMIv2                June, 2003


   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o The sctpAssocTable, sctpAssocLocalAddressTable,
   sctpAssocRemAddressTable and the lookup tables contain objects
   providing information on the active associations on the device, local
   and peer's IP addresses, the status of these associations and the
   associated processes. This information may be used by an attacker to
   launch attacks against known/unknown weakness in certain protocols /
   applications.

   o The sctpAssocTable contains objects providing information on local
   and remote ports objects, that can be used to identify what ports are
   open on the machine and can thus suggest what attacks are likely to
   succeed, without the attacker having to run a port scanner.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   The above objects also have privacy implications, i.e., they disclose
   who is connecting to what hosts.  These are sensitive from a
   perspective of preventing traffic analysis, and also to protect
   individual privacy.
