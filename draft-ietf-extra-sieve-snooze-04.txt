                Sieve Email Filtering: Snooze Extension
                    draft-ietf-extra-sieve-snooze-04

Abstract

   This document describes the "snooze" extension to the Sieve email
   filtering language.  The "snooze" extension gives Sieve the ability
   to postpone the delivery of an incoming email message into a target
   mailbox until a later point in time.

1.  Introduction

   Users are not always ready, willing, or able to read and respond to
   email messages at the time of their arrival.  Sometimes it is
   desirable to have messages appear in a mailbox at a more convenient
   time for the user to act upon them.

   This document defines an extension to the Sieve language [RFC5228]
   that enables scripts to postpone the delivery of a message into a
   target mailbox until a later point in time.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   Conventions for notations are as in Section 1.1 of [RFC5228],
   including use of the "Usage:" label for the definition of action and
   tagged arguments syntax.

Internet-Draft                Sieve Snooze                    March 2022


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Capability Identifier

   Sieve implementations that implement this extension have an
   identifier of "snooze" for use with the capability mechanism.

4.  Snooze Action

   Usage: snooze *AWAKEN-OPTIONS <times: string-list>

   The AWAKEN-OPTIONS argument is defined here in ABNF [RFC4234] syntax
   so that it can be modified by other extensions.

   AWAKEN-OPTIONS = MAILBOX / WEEKDAYS / TZID
                     ; each option MUST NOT appear more than once
                     ; however, per Section 2.6.2 of RFC 5228,
                     ; the tagged arguments in AWAKEN-OPTIONS
                     ; may appear in any order

   MAILBOX  = ":mailbox" string
   WEEKDAYS = ":weekdays" string-list
   TZID     = ":tzid" string

   The "snooze" action cancels the implicit keep and postpones delivery
   of the message into the specified mailbox at a later point in time.

   The snooze action is semantically equivalent to a delayed fileinto
   action (see Section 4.1 of [RFC5228]).  The arguments of the snooze
   action specify when, where, and how the awakened message will be
   filed.

   A Sieve interpreter MUST implement the snooze action by delivering
   the message to a special "snoozed" mailbox within its mailstore.
   IMAP [RFC3501] and JMAP [RFC8621] servers MUST apply the "Snoozed"
   (Section 8.3) attribute to this mailbox.  The message will reside in
   this special mailbox until the prescribed awaken time at which it
   will be moved into the specified target mailbox.

Internet-Draft                Sieve Snooze                    March 2022


4.1.  Mailbox Argument

   The optional :mailbox argument is used to specify the target mailbox
   that the message will be filed into when it is awakened.  It is
   equivalent to the mailbox argument of the fileinto action (see
   Section 4.1 of [RFC5228]).

   If :mailbox is omitted, or if the specified mailbox doesn't exist at
   the time of awakening, the message will be filed into the user's main
   mailbox.  For instance, in an implementation where an IMAP server is
   running scripts on behalf of the user at time of delivery, the user's
   "INBOX" would be the implicit target for awakening messages.

4.2.  Weekdays Argument

   The optional :weekdays argument specifies the set of days on which
   the specified set of awakening times apply.  Each day of the week is
   expressed as an integer between "0" and "6". "0" is Sunday, "1" is
   Monday, etc.  This syntax matches that of the "weekday" date-part
   argument to the date test extension (see Section 4.2 of [RFC5260]).

   If :weekdays is omitted, the set of awakening times applies to every
   day of the week.

4.3.  Times and TZID Arguments

   The required times argument, along with the optional :tzid argument,
   are used to specify when a snoozed message will be awakened.  Each
   time is specified in "hh:mm:ss" format and is interpreted as the
   local time in the time zone specified by the :tzid argument.

   The value of the :tzid argument MUST be a time zone identifier from
   the IANA Time Zone Database [tzdb].  If :tzid is omitted, the time
   zone of the Sieve interpreter is used.

   The combination of the weekdays and times form a chronological list
   of awaken times.  When a message is snoozed, it is assigned the next
   future awaken time in the list.  If a message is snoozed on a day
   with no awaken times, or after the last awaken time on a given day,
   the first awaken time on the next available day is used.

   If the local time in the specified time zone occurs more than once
   (daylight saving to standard time transition), the first occurrence
   of the specified time value is used.  If the local time in the
   specified time zone does not occur (standard to daylight saving time
   transition), the specified time value is interpreted using the UTC
   offset prior to the transition.

4.3.1.  Awaken Times Examples

   The following examples show, given the specified snooze action and a
   set of message arrival times, the corresponding times at which the
   message would be awakened and filed.

   The following example shows awaken times rolling into the next day or
   week.  Note that 2020-07-30 falls on a Thursday.

   require "snooze";
   snooze :weekdays ["1", "3", "5", "2", "4"]
          :tzid "Australia/Melbourne" ["12:00:00",
                                       "08:00:00", "16:00:00"];

4.4.  Interaction with Extensions to the Fileinto Action

   Some tagged arguments defined in extensions to the fileinto action
   can be used together with the snooze action.  The sections below
   describe these interactions.  Tagged arguments in future extensions
   to the fileinto action need to describe their interaction with the
   snooze extension, if any.

   When any fileinto extension arguments are used with the snooze
   extension, the corresponding extension MUST be enabled, and the
   arguments are defined to have the same syntax, semantics, and
   treatment as they do with the fileinto action.

4.4.1.  Imap4flags Extension

   When the "imap4flags" [RFC5232] extension is enabled in a script, two
   additional tagged arguments are added to "snooze" that allow
   manipulating the set of flags on a snoozed message.

   AWAKEN-OPTIONS /= ADDFLAGS / REMOVEFLAGS

   ADDFLAGS    = ":addflags" string-list
   REMOVEFLAGS = ":removeflags" string-list

   The optional :addflags and :removeflags arguments are used to specify
   which IMAP [RFC3501] flags should be added to and/or removed from the
   set of IMAP flags present on the snoozed message at the time of
   awakening.  Note the set of IMAP flags present at the time of
   awakening may be the empty set.

Internet-Draft                Sieve Snooze                    March 2022


   If the "setflag" and/or "addflag" actions have been used to store
   IMAP flags in the imap4flags internal variable, the Sieve interpreter
   MUST use the current value of the internal variable as the set of
   flags to associate with the message when storing it into the
   "snoozed" mailbox.

   This document doesn't dictate how the Sieve interpreter will set the
   IMAP flags.  In particular, the Sieve interpreter may work as an IMAP
   client or may have direct access to the mailstore.

   The general requirements for flag handling specified in Section 2 of
   [RFC5232] MUST be followed.

4.4.1.1.  Example

   The following example leverages the Date [RFC5260], Relational
   [RFC5231], and Imap4flags [RFC5232] extensions to snooze messages
   received after business hours until the following work day.  Note
   that the message is marked as important when it is snoozed, and will
   be marked as unread when it is awakened.

   require ["snooze", "imap4flags", "date", "relational"];

   if anyof(header :is "from" "boss@example.com",
            currentdate :is "weekday" "0",
            currentdate :is "weekday" "6",
            currentdate :value "ge" "hour" "17") {
       setflag "\\Important";
       snooze :removeflags "\\Seen"
              :weekdays ["1". "2", "3", "4", "5"]
              :tzid "American/New_York", "09:00";
   }

4.4.2.  Mailbox Extension

   This document extends the definition of the ":create" [RFC5490]
   tagged argument so that it can be used with the snooze action.

   AWAKEN-OPTIONS /= CREATE

   CREATE = ":create"
              ; MUST NOT be appear unless MAILBOX also appears

   If the optional ":create" argument is specified with snooze, it
   instructs the Sieve interpreter to create the target mailbox, if
   needed, before attempting to file the awakened message into the
   target mailbox.

Internet-Draft                Sieve Snooze                    March 2022


4.4.3.  Special-Use Extension

   This document extends the definition of the ":specialuse" [RFC8579]
   tagged argument so that it can be used with the snooze action.

   AWAKEN-OPTIONS /= SPECIAL-USE

   SPECIAL-USE = ":specialuse" string

   If the optional ":specialuse" argument is specified with snooze, it
   instructs the Sieve interpreter to check whether a mailbox exists
   with the specific special-use flag assigned to it.  If such a mailbox
   exists, the awakened message is filed into the special-use mailbox.
   Otherwise, the awakened message is filed into the target mailbox.

   If both the optional ":specialuse" and ":create" arguments are
   specified with snooze, the Sieve interpreter is instructed to create
   the target mailbox per Section 4.1 of [RFC8579], if needed.

4.4.4.  MailboxID Extension

   This document extends the definition of the ":mailboxid" [RFC9042]
   tagged argument so that it can be used with the snooze action.

   AWAKEN-OPTIONS /= MAILBOXID

   MAILBOXID = ":mailboxid" string

   If the optional ":mailboxid" argument is specified with snooze, it
   instructs the Sieve interpreter to check whether a mailbox exists in
   the user's personal namespace [RFC2342] with the specified MAILBOXID
   [RFC8474].  If such a mailbox exists, the awakened message is filed
   into that mailbox.  Otherwise, the awakened message is filed into the
   target mailbox.

   It is an error to specify both ":mailboxid" and ":specialuse" in the
   same snooze action.

5.  Implementation Status

   < RFC Editor: before publication please remove this section and the
   reference to [RFC7942] >

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to

   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

5.1.  Cyrus Server

   The open source Cyrus Server (http://www.cyrusimap.org/) project is a
   highly scalable enterprise mail system which supports Sieve email
   filtering at the point of final delivery.  This production level
   Sieve implementation supports all of the requirements described in
   this document.  This implementation is freely distributable under a
   BSD style license from Computing Services at Carnegie Mellon
   University (http://www.cmu.edu/computing/).

6.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are discussed in [RFC5228], [RFC5232],
   [RFC8579], and [RFC9042].

   It is believed that this extension doesn't introduce any additional
   security concerns.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   It is believed that this extension doesn't introduce any privacy
   considerations beyond those in [RFC5228].

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Registration of Sieve Extension

   This document defines the following new Sieve extension to be added
   to the registry defined in Section 6.2 of [RFC5228] and located here:
