Abstract

   This memo defines the profile of the MIME Content-Type [MIME-DIR] for
   directory information for a white-pages person object, based on a
   vCard electronic business card. The profile definition is independent
   of any particular directory service or protocol. The profile is
   defined for representing and exchanging a variety of information
   about an individual (e.g., formatted and structured name and delivery
   addresses, email address, multiple telephone numbers, photograph,
   logo, audio clips, etc.). The directory information used by this
   profile is based on the attributes for the person object defined in
   the X.520 and X.521 directory services recommendations. The profile
   also provides the method for including a [VCARD] representation of a
   white-pages directory entry within the MIME Content-Type defined by
   the [MIME-DIR] document.

1. Overview

   The [MIME-DIR] document defines a MIME Content-Type for holding
   different kinds of directory information. The directory information
   may be based on any of a number of directory schemas. This document
   defines a [MIME-DIR] usage profile for conveying directory
   information based on one such schema; that of the white-pages type of
   person object.

   The schema is based on the attributes for the person object defined
   in the X.520 and X.521 directory services recommendations. The schema
   has augmented the basic attributes defined in the X.500 series
   recommendation in order to provide for an electronic representation
   of the information commonly found on a paper business card. This

                      vCard MIME Directory Profile


   schema was first defined in the [VCARD] document. Hence, this [MIME-
   DIR] profile is referred to as the vCard MIME Directory Profile.

   A directory entry based on this usage profile can include traditional
   directory, white-pages information such as the distinguished name
   used to uniquely identify the entry, a formatted representation of
   the name used for user-interface or presentation purposes, both the
   structured and presentation form of the delivery address, various
   telephone numbers and organizational information associated with the
   entry. In addition, traditional paper business card information such
   as an image of an organizational logo or identify photograph can be
   included in this person object.

   The vCard MIME Directory Profile also provides support for
   representing other important information about the person associated
   with the directory entry. For instance, the date of birth of the
   person; an audio clip describing the pronunciation of the name
   associated with the directory entry, or some other application of the
   digital sound; longitude and latitude geo-positioning information
   related to the person associated with the directory entry; date and
   time that the directory information was last updated; annotations
   often written on a business card; Uniform Resource Locators (URL) for
   a website; public key information. The profile also provides support
   for non-standard extensions to the schema. This provides the
   flexibility for implementations to augment the current capabilities
   of the profile in a standardized way. More information about this
   electronic business card format can be found in [VCARD].

2. The vCard Mime Directory Profile Registration

   This profile is identified by the following [MIME-DIR] registration
   template information. Subsequent sections define the profile
   definition.

                      vCard MIME Directory Profile


   New parameters: TYPE

   Profile special notes: The type-grouping feature of [MIME-DIR] is
   supported by this profile to group related vCard properties about a
   directory entry. For example, vCard properties describing WORK or
   HOME related characteristics MAY be grouped with a unique group
   label.

   The profile permits the use of non-standard types (i.e., those
   identified with the prefix string "X-") as a flexible method for
   implementations to extend the functionality currently defined within
   this profile.

3. MIME Directory Features

   The vCard MIME Directory Profile makes use of many of the features
   defined by [MIME-DIR]. The following sub-sections describe specific
   usage constraints or extensions of these predefined features.

3.1 BEGIN and END Type

   The content entity MUST begin with the BEGIN type with a value of
   VCARD. The content entity MUST end with the END type with a value of
   VCARD.

3.2 NAME Type

   If the NAME type appears within a MIME entity conforming to this
   profile, it's value is the displayable, presentation text associated
   with the source for the vCard, as specified in the SOURCE type.

3.3 PROFILE Type

   If the PROFILE type appears within a MIME entity conforming to this
   profile, it's value must be "VCARD".

3.4 SOURCE Type

   If the SOURCE type appears within a MIME entity conforming to this
   profile, it's value provides information how to find the source for
   the vCard.

3.5 ENCODING Parameter

   The default transfer encoding for the vCard profile is "8bit". The
   default transfer encoding MAY be overridden for an individual type
   value by using the "ENCODING" type parameter. The parameter value can
   be reset to either "7bit", "base64" or "quoted-printable". This type
   parameter MAY be used on any type, unless specified otherwise by the
   profile type registration.

                      vCard MIME Directory Profile


3.6 CHARSET Parameter

   The default character set for the vCard profile is "UTF-8". The
   default transfer encoding MAY be overridden for an individual type
   value by using the "CHARSET" type parameter. The parameter value MAY
   be reset to any IANA registered character set. This type parameter
   MAY be used on any type, unless specified otherwise by the profile
   type registration.

3.7 LANGUAGE

   The default language for the vCard profile is "en-US" (US English).
   The default language MAY be overridden for an individual type value
   by using the "LANGUAGE" type parameter. The prameter value MAY be
   reset to any IANA registered language. This type parameter MAY be
   used on any type, unless specified otherwise by the profile type
   registration.

3.8 Line Endings

   The usual line-folding technique described in [MIME-DIR] can be used
   to represent type values consisting of long lines of text.

   A formatted text line break in a type value, MUST be specified by a
   (RFC 822) line break, which is a CRLF sequence. However, since the
   CRLF sequence is used to delimit a line, type values with formatted
   line breaks (i.e., multiple lines) MUST be encoded using the Quoted-
   Printable encoding.

   For example, in the Quoted-Printable encoding the multiple lines of
   formatted text are separated with a Quoted-Printable CRLF sequence of
   "=0D" followed by "=0A" followed by a Quoted-Printable soft line
   break sequence of "=". Quoted-Printable lines of text must also be
   limited to less than 76 characters. The 76 characters does not
   include the CRLF [RFC 822] line break sequence. For example a
   multiple line LABEL value of:

   Mr. John Q. Public
   123 Main Street
   Any Town, CA 12345

   Would be represented in a Quoted-Printable encoding as:

   LABEL;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Mr. John Q. Public=0D=0A=
   123 Mail Street=0D=0A=
   Any Town, CA   12345

3.9 Structured Type Values

   Compound property values are delimited by a field delimiter,
   specified by the SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59). A SEMI-
   COLON in a component of a compound property value must be escaped
   with a Backslash character

                      vCard MIME Directory Profile


   This profile supports the type grouping mechanism defined in [MIME-
   DIR]. Grouping of related types is a useful technique to communicate
   common semantics concerning the properties of a vCard.

4. vCard Features

4.1 VALUE Type Parameter

   The predefined data type values specified in [MIME-DIR] have been
   extended by the vCard profile to include a number of value types that
   are specific to this profile.

4.1.1 BINARY

   The "binary" value type specifies that the type value is inline,
   encoded binary data. This value type may be specified in the PHOTO,
   LOGO, SOUND, and KEY types.

   If inline, encoded binary data is specified, the ENCODING type
   parameter must be used to specify the encoding format.

   The value type is defined by the following notation:

   binchar = <Any character valid in the base64 or quoted-printable
   encoding>
   binary       = *binchar              ;A base64 or quoted-printable
   encoding of the binary information

4.1.2 VCARD

   The "vcard" value type specifies that the type value is another
   vCard. This value type may be specified in the AGENT type. The value
   type is defined by this specification.

4.1.3 PHONE-NUMBER

   The "phone-number" value type specifies that the type value is a
   telephone number. This value type may be specified in the TEL type.
   The value type is a text value that has the semantics of a telephone
   number.

4.1.4 UTC-OFFSET

   The "utc-offset" value type specifies that the type value is a signed
   offset from UTC. This value type may be specified in the TZ type.

   The format of the offset from UTC is defined by [DATETIME]. The value
   type is an offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It is
   specified as a positive or negative difference in units of hours and
   minutes (e.g., +hh:mm). The time is specified as a 24-hour clock.
   Hour values are from 00 to 24, and minute values are from 00 to 59.
   Hour and minutes are 2-digits with high order zeroes required to
   maintain digit count. The extended format for ISO 8601 UTC offsets

                      vCard MIME Directory Profile


   MUST be used. The extended format makes use of a colon character as a
   separator of the hour and minute text fields.

   The value is defined by the following notation:

        time-hour       = 2DIGIT        ;00-24
        time-minute     = 2DIGIT        ;00-60
        time-numzone    = ("+" / "-") time-hour ":" time-minute
        utc-offset      = time-numzone

4.2 Identification Types

   These types are used in the vCard profile to capture information
   associated with the identification and naming of the person or
   resource associated with the vCard.

   Type name: TITLE

   Type purpose: To specify the job title, functional position or
   function of the object the vCard represents.

   Type encoding: The default is 8bit. May also be reset to 7bit or
   quoted-printable.

   Type value: text.

   Type special notes: This type is based on the X.520 Title attribute.

   Type example:

   or business category of the object the vCard represents.

   Type encoding: The default is 8bit. May also be reset to 7bit or
   quoted-printable.

   Type value: text.

   Type special notes: This type is based on the X.520 Business Category
   explanatory attribute. This property is included as an organizational
   type to avoid confusion with the semantics of the TITLE type and
   incorrect usage of that type when the semantics of this type is
   intended.

   The type may specify the type parameters CHARSET, to specify a
   character set for the type value, and LANGUAGE, to specify a language
   for the type value. These are further defined in [MIME-DIR].

   Type example:

                ROLE:Programmer
