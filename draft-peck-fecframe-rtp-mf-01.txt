                     draft-peck-fecframe-rtp-mf-01

Abstract

   This document defines a new RTP payload format for the Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) that is used to protect multiple source flows.  The
   format defined by this document enables the protection of multiple
   media sources encapsulated in RTP with one or more repair flows and
   is based on the FEC framework (described in [I-D.ietf-fecframe-
   framework]) and the SDP Elements for FEC Framework (described in
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-sdp-elements]).

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for Multi-Flow FEC       March 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a new RTP payload format for the Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) protecting multiple source flows.

   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework] allows multiple source flows to be
   protected by the same FEC repair flow.

   Multiple source flows are transmitted either as Multi-Session or as
   Multi-source (see definition below).

   The format defined by this document enables the protection of
   multiple media source flows (Multi-Session or Multi-Source
   transmission) with one or more repair flows without adding additional
   information to the source packets.

   The method described in this document is generic to all FEC schemes.


2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Definitions, Notations and Abbreviations

   This document uses the following definitions and notations.  For
   further definitions that apply to FEC Framework in general, see
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework].

3.1.  Definitions

   FEC:  Forward Error Correction.

   Source Flow:  The packet flow to which FEC protection is to be
   applied.

   Repair Flow:  The packet flow carrying FEC data.

   Source Block:  The group of source data packets which are to be FEC
   protected as a single block.

   Source Packets:  Packets that are transmitted over a source flow

   Repair/FEC Packets:  Packets that are transmitted over a repair flow

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for Multi-Flow FEC       March 2010


   FEC header:  A FEC-scheme specific header as defined by different
   I-Ds, usually follows the RTP header.

   FEC-MF header:  The FEC Multi-flow header.  Contains information
   about the different source-flows and their order in the FEC block.

   multi-session transmission:  In multi-session transmission, media
   data from a single media source is split over multiple RTP sessions.
   The term "layered multicast" is equivalent to multi-session
   transmission for sessions using multicast addresses.

   multi-source transmission:  In multi-source transmission, data from a
   single media source is sent as several RTP streams in the same RTP
   session.  The sources contained in an RTP session are identified by
   their synchronization source identifiers (SSRCs) or, if combined by a
   RTP mixer, by their contributing source identifiers (CSRCs), as
   defined in RTP [RFC3550].

   Source Correlation:  The logical association of RTP streams
   transferred as multiple separate sessions or as multiple sources in
   the same session to one layered media.

3.2.  Notations


4.  Source Correlation

   When a FEC packet protects multiple source-flows (multi-session or
   multi-source transmission), the receiver must correlate between a
   received FEC packet and the RTP source-packets protected by it.

   For correlating between FEC packets and source flow packets sent as
   multi-sessions, this draft uses the 'fec-source-flow' (see section
   6.2) parameter sent in SDP as defined in SDP Elements for FEC
   Framework.  The list of different 'fec-source-flow' identifiers are
   used in a newly defined FEC-MF-Header.

   For correlating FEC packets and source flows sent as multi-source,
   the 'fec-source-flow' parameter is used as well.  However, as stated
   in RFC 3550 (section 5.2) 'multiplexing multiple related sources of
   the same medium in one RTP session using different SSRC values is the
   norm for multicast sessions'.  When different SSRCs are used on the
   same RTP session, the encoder is receiving RTP packets that use
   multiple sequence-number spaces.  Since a FEC encoder is not always
   aware of other source-flows transmitted on the same RTP session in
   multicast transmission, the SSRC should be used for source
   correlation in order to uniquely identify the protected source-flow.

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for Multi-Flow FEC       March 2010


   The coupling of the fec-source-flow and the source flow SSRC
   identifier creates a unique identifier for a source-flow, and
   therefore enables the FEC decoding procedure for multiple source
   flows.

   If the FEC encoding is done in a "middle-box" that receives the
   different source flows to be protected, the FEC encoder should
   validate the fec-source-flow idnetifiers for collisions.  When a
   collision is detected, the FEC encoder should answer with a different
   fec-source-flow than the one offered.  The fec-source-flow MUST not
   be changed during the session.


5.  Packet Formats

   This section defines the formats of the source and repair packets

5.1.  Source Packets

   The FEC Framework requires that source packets will contain
   information identifying the source block and the position within the
   source block occupied by the packet.  However, in order to maintain
   backwards compatibility, this document enables the receiver to get
   this information without appending additional information to the
   source packet.  Specifically this information is obtained using the
   combination of sequence number and SSRC identifier found in the RTP
   header, and information provided in the FEC header and FEC-MF header
   of each repair packet.  Such behavior enables both non-FEC-capable
   and FEC-capable receivers to receive and interpret the same source
   packets sent in a multicast session.

5.2.  Repair Packets

   The FEC repair packets contain information that enables the receiver
   to reconstruct the source block in the remote end.  This is done by
   using the RTP header of the repair packets as well as other headers
   placed within the RTP payload.  The additional headers, referred to
   as the FEC headers as shown in Figure 1 from the [FECFRAME-FRAMEWORK]
   (section 6.4.1), are the FEC-MF header and the additional FEC headers
   for each source-flow, as shown in Figure 2.

   The FEC repair packets MUST be sent in a separate RTP session from
   the protected source-flows.

5.2.1.  RTP header format

   The RTP header is formatted according to [RFC3550] with some further
   clarifications listed below:

   o  Payload Type:  The (dynamic) payload type for the repair packets
      is determined through out-of-band means.  Note that this document
      registers new payload formats for the repair packets (Refer to
      Section 6 for details).  According to [RFC3550], an RTP receiver
      that cannot recognize a payload type must discard it.  This
      provides for backward compatibility.  The FEC mechanisms can then
      be used in a multicast group with mixed FEC-capable and non-FEC-
      capable receivers.  If a non-FEC-capable receiver receives a
      repair packet, it will not recognize the payload type, and hence,
      will discard the repair packet.

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for Multi-Flow FEC       March 2010


   o  Sequence Number (SN):  The sequence number maintains the standard
      definition.  It is one higher than the sequence number in the
      previously transmitted repair packet.  The initial value of the
      sequence number is random (unpredictable) [RFC3550].

   o  Timestamp (TS):  The timestamp is set to a time corresponding to
      the repair packet's transmission time.  Note that the timestamp
      value has no use in the actual FEC protection process and is
      usually useful for jitter calculations.

   o  Synchronization Source (SSRC):  The SSRC value is randomly
      assigned as suggested by [RFC3550].

5.2.2.  FEC-MF header format

   The FEC-MF header includes information that enables the receiver to
   correlate a received FEC packet with the protected source-flows.

   The FEC-MF header includes a list of source-flow identifiers (FID
   list), and optionaly, a list of SSRC identifiers (SSRC list) for
   uniquely identifying the protected source flows.  The optional SSRC
   list is appended to the FEC-MF header.

   Specific FEC-scheme information for every source-flow is provided by
   the FEC headers appended to the MF-FEC header.  The FEC headers are
   ordered by the FID in the FID list.

   The order of the FIDs (and the matching FEC headers) should be the
   same as the order of the source flows as they were arranged in the
   FEC source block before encoding.  This is required to ensure the
   correct construction of the FEC block for the decoding process.

   The format of the FEC-MF header is shown in figure 3.

   The FEC-MF header consists of the following general fields:

   o  L-Bit- A bit indicating whether the optional list of SSRC
      identifiers is appended to the FEC-MF header.  When set to 0, no
      SSRC identifiers are specified (for cases where the FID is
      sufficient as a unique identifier).  When set to 1, a list of SSRC
      identifiers is appended to the FEC-MF header.  The length of this
      list is (4 bytes * Num Flows).  Each 4 bytes represent the SSRC of
      the flow specified by the order of the FID list in the FEC-MF
      header.

   o  Num Flows - The number of source flows protected by this FEC
      packet.  Maximum number of protected source flows is 128.

   o  FID - Source flow Identifier.  The FEC-MF includes a list of FID
      identifying each source flow.  The FID value is as specified in
      the id parameter in the "fec-source-flow" field in SDP.  See
      example in section 6.3.3.  The number of FID fields is 'Num Flows'
      which represents the FID list size .  The FEC-MF header will be
      padded with zeros to 4-bytes alignment, if needed, after the last
      FID field (calculation for number of padded bytes is:  4-((2+Num
      Flows)%4)).  Each FID is correlated with a FEC header appended to
      the FEC-MF header by the order of the FID in the FID list.  The
      number of appended FEC headers MUST equal the value of 'Num
      Flows'.  Since FID field is 8 bits, the "fec-source-flow" field in
      SDP should be between 0 and 255.  This limits the number of
      source-flows protected by FEC to 256 flows.

   o  SSRC identifiers - list of SSRC identifiers (optional).  If the
      L-Bit is 0, the list length is 0.  If set to 1, the list length is
      (4*Num Flows), where each SSRC is taken from the protected source-
      flow SSRC field in the RTP header, and is represented by 4 bytes.

   Editor's Note:  in order to avoid sending unnecessary SSRC
   identifiers, it should be defined when the SSRC is redundant
   information.  SSRC is redundant when Multi-Source is not used, or
   when there is only one sender for the RTP session.  In this case the
   'fec-source-flow' is a unique idetifier for a source flow.

5.2.3.  FEC Headers Format

   The FEC-MF header is followed by a list of FEC headers, according to
   the FEC-scheme signalled by SDP (See Section 6).  Each FEC header in
   the list represents the matching fec-source-flow in the FID list by
   order.

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for Multi-Flow FEC       March 2010


5.2.4.  Repair Data Format

   The repair data is added after the last FEC header in the RTP repair
   packet.  It includes the result of FEC scheme code over the source
   block constructed from the different source-flows.  The repair data
   format is defined by the FEC scheme used for this repair packet as
   signalled by SDP.


6.  Payload Format Parameters

   According to the FEC framework, when RTP is used as a transport for
   repair packet flows, the scheme must define an RTP Payload Format for
   the repair data.  This section provides the media subtype
   registration for the Multi-Flow FEC.  The parameters that are
   required to configure the FEC encoding and decoding operations are
   also defined in this section.

6.1.  Registration of application/mf-fec

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  mf-fec

   Required parameters:

   o  FEC-scheme - the FEC scheme used for encoding.  The value used
      here should be the FEC payload type as it was registered in the
      relevant RFC/draft.

   Optional parameters:  None.

   Encoding considerations:  This media type is framed and binary, see
   section 4.8 in [RFC4288]

   Security considerations:  Please see security consideration in
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework]

   Interoperability considerations:  None.

   Published specification:  TBD

   Applications that use this media type:  Multimedia applications that
   want to improve resiliency against packet loss by sending redundant
   data for multiple source media flows.

   Additional information:  None.

   Magic number(s):  none defined

   File extension(s):  none defined

   Macintosh file type code(s):  none defined

   Person & email address to contact for further information:  Orly
   Peck, orlyp@radvision.com

   Intended usage:  COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:  This media type depends on RTP framing, and
   hence is only defined for transfer via RTP [RFC3550].  Transport
   within other framing protocols is not defined at this time.


7.  Mapping of SDP Parameters

   For a proper operation details of the FEC operation have to be
   communicated between the sender and the receiver.  The receiver must
   be notified that the FEC operation was used for multiple source
   flows.  Specifically, the receiver has to know the FEC scheme that
   was used by the sender to encode the source flows.  In addition,
   different FEC scheme-specific parameters should be communicated.  One
   way to provide this information is to use the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566].

   The mapping of the media type specification for "mf-fec" and their
   parameters in SDP is as follows:

   o  The media type (e.g., "application") goes into the "m=" line as
      the media name.

   o  The media subtype ("mf-fec") goes into the "a=rtpmap" line as the
      encoding name.

   o  The 'FEC-scheme' goes into the "a=fmtp" line, followed by a
      semicolon-separated list of parameter that are required for the
      specific used FEC-scheme.

   o  The "group" and "fec-source-flow" attributes should be used
      according to [I-D.ietf-fecframe-sdp-elements].

   See section 9 for SDP examples.

8.  FEC Packet Example

   This section demonstrates the structure and data in a FEC packet
   protecting multiple source flows.

   In this example, the following FEC packet is the result of Reed-
   Solomon encoding for 3 different source flows.  Two of the source
   flows (1 and 2) share the same RTP session and same payload type, and
   are differentiated by different SSRC identifiers (Multi-Source
   Transmission).  The other source flow (3) is transmitted through a
   different RTP session but share the same SSRC identifier as the one
   used by source-flow 2 (Mutliple-Session Transmission).

   The FEC payload represents the Reed-Solomon scheme over RTP as
   defined in draft-galanos-fecframe-rtp-reedsolomon-01.  This draft is
   general for all FEC schemes transmitted through RTP, and the use of
   Reed-Solomon is only for illustration purposes.

   The source-flows protected by this FEC packet are defined as follows:

   o  source-flow-1:  identified as fec-source-flow:  id=0 in SDP, with
      SSRC=10.

   o  source-flow-2:  identified as fec-source-flow:  id=0 in SDP, with

9.  Application considerations

   Protecting multiple flows with the same repair flow might be more
   efficient in terms of bandwidth overhead and FEC strength.  An
   appropriate example for bandwidth efficiency would be a 3D
   interactive video application (2D plus depth) where a FEC protection
   must be applied to a single frame only, due to latency
   considerations.  If, for example, each frame (2D or depth) is
   transmitted by 4 RTP packets, the miniumum bandwidth overheader for
   protecting each source flow separately is 25%, with a single repair
   packet for each frame (one for 2D frame, and one for depth frame).
   By protecting both frames together (2D and depth) with the same
   repair flow, the bandwidth overhead can be reduced to 12.5% (A single
   repair packet for all 8 RTP source packets).  This, ofcourse, reduces
   the FEC strength to the level chosen be the application.

   Protecting multiple source flows can increase FEC strength as
   described in the following example:  When protecting each frame
   separately with a single repair packet, if two packets are lost from
   a the same frame, they cannot be repaired.

   However, if we protect both flows (8 RTP packets) with a scheme such
   as Reed-Solomon, with 2 repair packets (without actually increasing
   the bandwidth overhead), any two lost packets from both frames (total
   of 8 RTP packets) may be repaired.  However, an example for an
   application that is not suitable for multiple source flows
   protection, would be an application that protects two flows where one
   of the flows is prone to high packet loss rates, and the other source
   flow is prone to low packet loss rates.  Protecting both flows with
   one repair flow, will damage the rate of successful repairing of
   packets of the flow that is prone to low packet loss rate.


10.  Offer/Answer considerations

   When offering multiple source flows FEC protection over RTP using SDP
   in an Offer/Answer model [RFC3264], the following considerations
   apply:

   o  When protecting multiple sources, the sender may suggest various
      FEC-schemes to be used for the FEC protection.  Each FEC-scheme
      should be indicated as a separate offer.  The receiver may choose
      the supported/preferred FEC-scheme to be used.

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for Multi-Flow FEC       March 2010


   o  The specific FEC-scheme parameters can also be indicated as
      separated offers.  For example, using the same FEC-scheme but with
      two differnt repair-window size parameters should be indicated in
      separated offers.  Once the receiver decides the FEC-scheme to be
      used, it should choose the specific offer among the different
      offers for the chosen scheme based on the FEC-scheme parameters.

   o  When a receiver does not support the fec-mf scheme, these offers
      MUST be ignored and deleted from the answer.  The sender may add
      other single source flow FEC protection offers for receivers that
      do not support multiple source flows protection.

   o  If multiple source flow FEC protection is not desired by the
      receiver, it can be deleted from the answer.


11.  Security Considerations

   Multiple flow FEC protection is FEC-scheme independent.  Any FEC
   scheme can be used for protection.  Therefore, the security
   considerations for using multiple flow FEC protection are dependent
   on the actual used FEC-scheme, and should be taken under
   considerations when using it.

   Other security considerations are implied by using RTP for multiple
   flow protection:

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550] and in any applicable RTP profile.  The main
   security considerations for the RTP packet carrying the RTP payload
   format defined within this memo are confidentiality, integrity and
   source authenticity.  Confidentiality is achieved by encrypting the
   RTP payload.  Integrity of the RTP packets is achieved through a
   suitable cryptographic integrity protection mechanism.  Such a
   cryptographic system may also allow the authentication of the source
   of the payload.  A suitable security mechanism for this RTP payload
   format should provide confidentiality, integrity protection, and at
   least source authentication capable of determining if an RTP packet
   is from a member of the RTP session.

   Note that the appropriate mechanism to provide security to RTP and
   payloads following this memo may vary.  It is dependent on the
   application, transport and signaling protocol employed.  Therefore, a
   single mechanism is not sufficient, although if suitable, using the
   Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] is recommended.
   Other mechanisms that may be used are IPsec [RFC4301] and Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] (RTP over TCP); other alternatives may

   exist.


12.  IANA Considerations

   New media subtypes are subject to IANA registration.  For the
   registration of the payload formats and their parameters introduced
   in this document, refer to Section 7.
