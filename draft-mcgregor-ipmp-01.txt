2. Abstract

   The practice and need for active measurement of networks is well
   established, however current tools are not well suited to this
   task, mostly because the protocols which they employ have not
   been designed for measurement of the modern Internet.
   The IP Measurement Protocol (IPMP) is based on packet-probes, and
   is designed to allow routers to participate in measurements by the
   insertion of path information as the probe passes between a pair of
   hosts.  IPMP is tightly constrained and easy to implement.

2.  Introduction

   The practice and need for active measurement of networks is well
   established, however current tools are not well suited to this
   task, mostly because the protocols which they employ have not
   been designed for measurement of the modern Internet.  

   For example, ICMP is widely used for measurement despite its
   well known limitations for this task.  These limitations include
   it being treated different to other IP protocols at routers and
   hosts because it is difficult to efficiently generate appropriate
   response packets.  ICMP has also received bad press from denial of
   service attacks and because of the number of sites generating
   monitoring traffic.  As a consequence, some ISPs disable ICMP even
   though this potentially causes poor performance and does not comply
   with RFC1009 [1].

   Current packet probing techniques are not suited to measuring packet
   delay at the router level.  Routers often make bad measurement
   targets because they are optimised for the relatively simple task of
   forwarding packets.  Routers may process tasks that are resource
   intensive and therefore an opportunity for a denial of service
   attack at low priority or not at all.  Some measurement techniques
   construct measurement traffic that can be difficult to efficiently
   detect and respond to amongst other network traffic.  This type of
   measurement traffic precludes measuring to a router and makes the
   task of identifying where delay occurs in the network difficult.

   IPMP addresses these issues by providing a measurement protocol
   that is tightly constrained, efficient and easy to implement.
   The protocol has been designed so measurement packets can be
   processed with about the same level of computation as IP packet
   forwarding.

   The protocol operates as an echo protocol allowing packet loss,
   one-way path length, RTT and in some cases, one-way delay
   measurements to be taken.  The protocol also allows a measurement
   host to identify individual router units from the interface IP
   addresses it collects in the echo exchange by exchanging
   information packets after the measurement has completed.

   Packets are generated by a measurement host and returned by an
   echoing router or host, known as an echoing system in this memo.
   The translation of router time stamps to real time time stamps is
   supported through a separate information request and reply exchange
   between the measurement system and systems that insert time stamps
   into the echo request or reply.

   Version = 0

   Checksum

      The checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's
      complement sum of the IPMP message starting with the version
      number.  For computing the checksum, the checksum is set to
      zero.

   Faux IP Prot, Faux Source Port, Faux Destination Port

      The faux IP prot, faux source port, and faux destination port
      mimic the IP protocol field and TCP or UDP source and
      destination ports (if appropriate). These fields allow an IPMP
      echo packet to be queued or filtered based on a five-tuple of
      values when combined with the IP source and destination
      addresses.  Intermediate routers schedule this packet if they
      implement a packet scheduling discipline that is not FIFO.

      When the echo packet is received at the target, the faux source
      and destination ports MUST be swapped to reflect the way that
      ports are conceptually swapped in a UDP or TCP header at the
      target.

INTERNET-DRAFT         IP Measurement Protocol            February 2003


   Identifier, Sequence Number

      The echo request packet should contain enough information to
      match an echo response packet.  The identifier SHOULD be set to
      the lower 16 bits of the process identifier responsible for
      sending the packet, and the sequence number SHOULD increment for
      each echo request packet sent to a unique IP address with a
      particular identifier value.

      Firewalls that keep state SHOULD use the Identifier field -
      combined with the source and destination IP addresses and IP
      protocol number (not faux IP Prot) - to hash a packet in order 
      to decide which echo packets to pass.

   Path Pointer

      The position, in bytes from the beginning of the IPMP packet, of
      the next available path record location, if there is space.
      If an intermediary inserts a path record, it MUST increment the
      path pointer by the size of the path record inserted.

   Path Records

      The measurement host MAY pre-allocate space for path records to
      be inserted.  The start and end offsets of the space are given
      by the IPMP path pointer and IP length fields respectively.  The
      pre-allocated space MUST be initialised to zero.

   IP Address of Receiving Interface

      The address of interface at which the packet was received by the
      system that inserted the Path Record into the Echo Request or
      Echo Reply packet.

   TTL / HLIM

      A host or router MAY include the value of the TTL or HLIM field
      in the packet's IP header after it has been decremented as part
      of the forwarding process.  This allows an end-host to identify
      gaps in the network where a path record was not inserted.  If
      this field is not inserted by a host or router that does insert
      a path record it MUST be left at zero.
   

   Timestamp

      A host or router MAY include the time at which the interface
      completed receiving the packet. If the timestamp is not set in
      the path record, the value is left as zero.  The timestamp is
      allocated 48 bits, although the host or router can use any
      number of bits.  The timestamp, if included, SHOULD represent
      the time that the last bit of the packet was received.



McGregor                                                       [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT         IP Measurement Protocol            February 2003


      A host or router MAY specify that the timestamp is recorded
      relative to UTC by setting the U bit.  In this case, the first
      16 bits specify seconds elapsed since the last time the seconds
      field wrapped, and the following 32 bits specify the fraction of
      the second that has elapsed.  This timestamp format has a
      resolution of 200 picoseconds.  The seconds field wraps
      approximately every 18 hours.

      To recover the timestamp to seconds since the epoch, the
      following C code could be used

      struct ipmp_pathrecord
      {
        struct in_addr addr;
        u_int8_t       ttl;
        u_int8_t       opts;
        u_int16_t      sec;
        u_int32_t      fsec;
      } pr;

      struct timeval tv;
      gettimeofday(&tv, &tz);
      tv.tv_sec = (tv_sec & 0xffff0000) | (ntohs(pr.sec) & 0xffff);

      The precise relationship between the timestamp and real time,
      if there is one, must be derived using information from an IPMP
      Information Reply (see section 4.3). If a timestamp is included
      by a system, it must be able to process IPMP Information Request
      Packets at the address included in the Path Record.

   Performance Data Pointer

      The position, in bytes from the beginning of the IPMP packet,
      of the performance data field, if it exists.  If there is no
      performance data field, it is set to 0.

   IP Address Identifying Router

      In order for a measurement host to identify individual routers
      on a network, a router must reply to information requests sent
      to any of its interfaces using a consistent address in this
      field. The field may contain any address unique to the router.

INTERNET-DRAFT         IP Measurement Protocol            February 2003


   IPMP Processing Overhead

      The maximum difference between the time taken to process and
      forward an IPMP packet and the time taken to forward an IP
      packet with the same characteristics.  The echo system may use
      the values supplied in faux IP Prot, Faux Source Port, and Faux
      Destination Port if it implements a queueing discipline that is
      not FIFO.  If the overhead is unknown, then the value recorded
      is MAX_TIME, i.e. all bits to 1.


   Reported Time of Interest

      A measurement system MAY request that the end system constrain
      the real time reference points to cover a particular timestamp
      that it received.  In this case the timestamping system SHOULD
      return a realtime reference point for just this timestamp or a
      pair of reference points, one before and one after the
      timestamp.  In other cases the timestamping system MAY return an
      arbitrary number of reference points bounded by the size of the
      packet it can send.

   Realtime Reference Points

      A realtime reference point (see section 2.1.4) gives the
      relationship between realtime and the timestamp that would have
      been placed in a path record by the interface at that time.
      If any reference points are included, there must be at least two.
      Within the bounds of the overall size of the packet any number of
      reference points may be included.

   Performance Data

      The Performance Data field allows arbitrary information from the
      MIB of the system or the interface to optionally be included in
      the Information Reply.  It is formatted as a VarBindList from the
      SNMPv2-PDU defined in [4].  In this context ObjectSyntax is the
      only valid choice within VarBind.

3.  Processing of IPMP packets

3.1 Measurement host processing

   A measurement host constructs an IPMP request, encapsulates it
   in an IP datagram and the appropriate link layer protocol and
   sends it into the network.  Performance information is gleaned
   from the presence or absence of a reply, the delay between the
   request and the reply, the value of TTL and the path record(s) if
   present, and possibly the presence of errors.

   The measurement host, when constructing the echo request, sets
   all words from the end of the data field to the end of the echo
   request (the space allocated for path records) to zero.

   When an IPMP echo reply arrives, the checksum is recomputed and
   checked with the checksum present in the IPMP header.

3.2  Echoing system processing 

   The IPMP Echo Request and Echo Reply packet formats are designed to
   make processing at the echoing host simple and efficient.

   On receipt of the IPMP Echo Request, the echoing system constructs
   the echo reply from the echo request by:

    1. exchanging the IP source and destination addresses

    2. exchanging the Faux Source and Destination ports

    3. setting the reply bit in the IPMP Options field and incrementally
       updating the checksum

    4. optionally inserting a path record as described in 
       section 3.3.1

    5. scheduling the packet for forwarding, taking account of the
       queue type field if appropriate

   The echoing system does not:

     o validate the value of the IPMP checksum present in the header
       against the contents of the packet

     o recalculate the IPMP checksum from scratch before transmitting
       the packet

     o decrement or otherwise alter the IP header's TTL or recalculate
       the IP header's checksum

     o process fragments or IP options

   Processing IPMP Information Request packets requires more resources
   than an Echo Request.  Direct measurements are not made from
   Information Request packets.  Consequently, an implementer may
   choose to processes Information Request packets off the interface
   card and/or at low priority.

3.3 Forwarding System Processing

   A forwarding router does not need to be IPMP aware.  In the
   simplest case, an IPMP packet is forwarded like any other IP
   packet.  

   If the forwarding system schedules packets based on the value of
   any combination of the IP protocol field and the TCP or UDP source
   and destination ports, then the forwarding system MUST use the faux
   fields in the IPMP header for this purpose instead of the IP, TCP
   or UDP fields.  Note that the Faux Source and Destination port
   numbers are in the same position in an IPMP packet as they are in a
   TCP or UDP packet but the Faux IP prot is not.

   A forwarding router MAY include a path record as described in
   section 3.3.1.

3.3.1 Path Record Insertion

   Inclusion of path records is optional.  A path record MAY be
   inserted by forwarding systems on the forward and reverse paths,
   by the measurement host, and by the echoing system.

   A forwarding system SHOULD NOT insert a path record if it
   cannot modify the packet in the same processing stream that any
   other packet would take.  This is to avoid the measurement path
   being significantly different to that taken by a regular packet,
   and to reduce opportunities for denial of service (see section
   3.4).

   A system that can insert a path record MUST check for sufficient
   space in the echo packet based on the size of the path record
   inserted.  An IPv4 path record requires 12 bytes, while the IPv6
   path record requires 24 bytes.

   A system which inserts a path record MUST increase the Path
   Pointer as appropriate, and MUST also incrementally update the
   IPMP Checksum field as described in [5].  The length of the packet
   is not changed.

   A system that adds a path record MAY include a timestamp in the
   path record.  If it does not include a timestamp, the timestamp
   field in the path record is left unaltered, i.e. remains zero.

3.4 Denial of service attacks

   Because IPMP echo request packets are processed with about the
   same effort as forwarding an IP packet they do not introduce any
   new denial of service opportunities.

   IPMP Information Request packets require more processing and may
   be used as the basis of a denial of service attack in the same
   way as any information request on a router or host.  Because
   Information Request packets are not used to make measurements an
   implementer may implement protection against denial of service
   attacks made with these packets in the same way as other
   information requests.  This might involve processing IPMP
   Information Requests at a low priority or regulating the
   maximum flow of packets.
 
4. Discussion

4.1 Checksums

   The IPMP checksum is calculated by the measurement host when it
   creates the echo request packet.  It is incrementally updated
   by forwarding systems that insert a path record.
   The checksum is not checked by a forwarding system or an echoing
   system.  Errors that occur between the measurement host and the
   echoing system on the forward and reverse paths are detected when
   the echo reply is received at the measurement host.

4.2 Realtime Timestamps

   32 bit realtime timestamp fields are coded following the
   conventions described in RFC1305 NTP [2].  Summarising from
   RFC1305:

       In conformance with standard Internet practice, timestamps
       are specified as integer or fixed-point quantities, with
       bits numbered in big-endian fashion from 0 starting at the
       left, or high-order, position. All quantities are unsigned
       and may occupy the full field width with an implied 0
       preceding bit 0.
       
       Timestamps are represented as a 64-bit unsigned fixed-point
       number, in seconds relative to 0h on 1 January 1900. The
       integer part is in the first 32 bits and the fraction part
       in the last 32 bits. In the fraction part, the
       non-significant low order can be set to 0.

      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

 
       This format allows convenient multiple-precision arithmetic
       and conversion to UDP/TIME representation (seconds), but
       does complicate the conversion to ICMP Timestamp message
       representation, which is in milliseconds. The most future
       time that can be represented is 4,294,967 (some time in the
       year 2036) with a precision of about 200 picoseconds, which
       should be adequate for even the most demanding measurements.
       RFC 2030 (SNTP) contains a proposal for extending timestamps
       beyond the year 2036.

4.3 Inferred Realtime

   The realtime of a timestamp in a path record can be inferred when
   a system provides an IPMP Information Reply with at least one Real
   Time Reference Point earlier and one later than the timestamp.  For
   the purpose of this inference, the clock drift of the is assumed to
   be linear.  Linear interpolation is used between the two nearest
   Realtime Reference Points, where one is greater than and one is
   less than the timestamp.

   The timestamp in the path record structure may be of any format, as
   discussed in Section 2.1.2, and the timestamp potentially can wrap
   over the course of a series of measurements.  It is the
   responsibility of the measurement host to send information requests
   to the timestamping systems sufficiently frequently to avoid
   information loss.  The correct frequency can be estimated from an
   information reply.
    
4.4 Minimum Implementations.

4.4.1 Echoing System

   The simplest echoing system implementation returns the IPMP echo
   request without a path record.  As described in section 3.2, this
   only requires that the IP source and destination addresses be
   exchanged, the R bit in the IPMP options field to be set and the
   packet scheduled for forwarding.  Because of the format of the IPMP
   echo request and echo reply packets this can be implemented with a
   very small number of instructions.  A system that does not insert
   path records does not need to processes IPMP Information Requests.




McGregor                                                      [Page 14]

INTERNET-DRAFT         IP Measurement Protocol            February 2003


   Systems which just provide this level of implementation allow a
   number of measurements to be made that are not currently
   possible, particularly if they are routers that processes ICMP
   at a low priority to avoid DOS attacks.

4.4.2 Forwarding System

   Forwarding systems do not need to be IPMP aware.

   A forwarding system that is IPMP aware MAY include path records
   with only the Forwarding IP Address set.  This requires writing
   the address to the packet and updating the checksum and Path
   Pointer in the packet as described in section 3.3.1 and 4.2.1.
   In this case the forwarding system does not need to process IPMP
   Information Request packets.
