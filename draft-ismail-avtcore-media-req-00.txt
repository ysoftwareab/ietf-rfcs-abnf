1.  Introduction

   Modern audio and video conferencing systems include RTP middleboxes
   that can often "switch" video and audio streams without mixing them.
   When receivers have homogenous coding capabilities and can receive
   multiple streams each, such media switchers avoid the need to decode
   and re-encode media for the purpose of compositing video or mixing
   audio.  Instead they can forward encoded media as it was sent by the
   transmitter.  In this case, a media switching device can behave more
   like a media switching RTP Translator
   [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-topologies-update], which we will label an RTP
   Translator Forwarding Switch (RTFS).

   Modern audio and video conferencing systems have also decomposed
   switching infrastructure into a) a controller that deals with the
   signaling and keeps track of who is in the conference and b) one or
   more media switching devices that receive, rewrite headers and
   transmit streams to receivers.  In scalable systems, media switching
   devices may be deployed in many distributed locations to optimize
   bandwidth or latency and may be rented on demand from third-parties
   to meet peak loading needs.  Therefore, there is a need to locate
   switching devices in data centers and/or be operated by third-parties
   not otherwise trusted with decryption or encryption of audio and
   video media.

   This draft outlines the requirements for enabling media switching/
   RTFS devices to perform only the functions they need to, including
   header rewites and authenticating transmitters and receivers, without

   having to acquire or use the keys to provide confidentiality and
   integrity for the media in SRTP.  This enables deployments where the
   privacy of the media can be assured even when a third-party service
   is used for switching media.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Media Switching/RTFS Architecture

   In traditional conferencing systems, the conferencing media
   infrastructure fully decrypts, decodes and processes RTP media
   streams received from one or more transmitters prior to forwarding
   the newly encoded (transcoded, composited and/or mixed) and encrypted
   RTP media streams to the rest of receivers.  Media Switching Mixers,
   which may need to composite or mix media, maintain independent and
   persistent SRTP sessions with each endpoint
   [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-topologies-update].  More specifically, each
   endpoint establishes a point-to-point SRTP session with conferencing
   media infrastructure, which has its own persistent SSRCs, SRTP keys
   and SRTP contexts (reference the figure below) [RFC7201].

   +---+      +--------------------+      +---+

                    Figure 1: Traditional MCU or Mixer

   When receivers have homogenous coding capabilities and can receive
   multiple streams each, a media switcher can avoid processing media
   and (selectively) forward streams while manipulating only the
   necessary parts of the RTP headers prior to forwarding to receivers.
   The RTP payload part of streams from transmitters is forwarded
   without any processing or changes.

   In this case, a media switching device can behave more like a
   scalable RTP Translator Forwarding Switch (RTFS), maintaining the
   SSRCs of the transmitting endpoints rather than generating their own
   persistent SSRCs towards every receiving endpoint (reference the
   figure below).  Though this is not the only viable embodiment of a

   media switching architecture, this is the most relevant for the
   requirements discussed in this document.

   These media switching/RTFS devices may selectively forward only
   certain transmitted stream(s) at any given time, such as the video
   and audio stream from the currently active speaker.  In this case,
   endpoints receive different RTP video streams that are generated by
   different transmitters, each with its own SSRC, SRTP key and SRTP
   context.  All these streams are rendered to the end user as a single
   video source representing the most active speaker.  Moreover,
   endpoints do not receive the same RTP streams all the times.  For
   example, in the figure below, endpoints A, B and D receive the video
   streams from endpoint C, the currently active speaker, which is
   actually receiving video from endpoint A, the previous active
   speaker.  Later, when endpoint B becomes the active speaker, then
   endpoints A, C and D will start to receive video from B, which
   continues to receive video from endpoint C.  In the final time slot,
   when Endpoint A becomes the active speaker, the process continues.

   Meeting the objective of scalability and simplicity in this media
   switching architecture starts with minimizing/eliminating the media
   processing performed by the media switching device, but can also to
   be extended to cryptography, where crypto processing and crypto state
   maintained by the media switching/RTFS devices are minimized.  With
   the advent of cloud-based services, it is essential to enable
   deployments where the privacy of the media can be assured even when a
   third-party service is used for conference switching.  Then
   enterprises can use cloud-based, third-party conferencing services
   while restricting such from accessing and manipulation of their media
   content.  The ability to eliminate the need of media switching/RTFS
   devices to decrypt and re-encrypt packets is not merely a scalability
   and simplicity requirement, but is also a core security requirement
   in cloud-based conferencing services.

4.  RTP header manipulation

   A media switching/RTFS device might need to modify some of the RTP
   header fields to map between different values picked by different
   endpoints prior to switching.  An example is the RTP payload type
   values which for SIP endpoints calling into the conference are picked
   by the endpoints.  Different endpoints are likely to pick different
   values for the same media format.  The media switching device is
   responsible for mapping between such different values.  In the case
   of RTP payload types, the conference system might be able to send a
   SIP reinvite to renegotiate the RTP payload type value down to a
   shared value hence avoiding the remapping.  This mechanism does not
   always work as endpoints can choose to use asymmetric payload types.
   Renegotiation also adds complexity and delays to the conferencing
   system.  Other RTP header fields such as RTP extension headers can
   also be modified, deleted or added as they are negotiated separately
   with each participants.

   On the other hand, two of the RTP fields must not be modified by
   media switches that do not have access to the media encryption keys.
   These two fields are the SSRC and the RTP sequence number.  Both
   fields are used in the calculation of the SRTP cipher's IV, thus
   requiring a total re-encryption upon modification.

   Below is the set of RTP header fields along with whether a media
   switching/RTFS device might modify them, unlikely to modify them or
   must not modify them.

   o  Version (V): This field is unlikely to be modified by the media
      switching device

   o  Padding marker (P): This field is unlikely to be modified by the
      media switching device

   o  Extension (X): The media switching device might modify this field
      when it needs to add RTP extension headers where none existed or
      if it needs to delete existing RTP extension headers

   o  Contributing sources count (CC): The media switching device is
      unlikely to modify this field

   o  Marker bit (M): This field is unlikely to be modified by the media
      switching device

   o  Payload Type (PT): The media switching device might modify this
      field to map between different RTP type values picked by different
      endpoints

   o  Sequence Number (SEQ): The media switching device must not modify
      this field

   o  Timestamp (TS): This field is unlikely to be modified by the media
      switching device

   o  Synchronization Source (SSRC): This field must not be modified by
      the media switching device

   o  Extension Header (ExtHDR): The media switching device is likely
      modify this field either to change its value or to delete it
      completely

5.  Requirements

   The following are the security solution requirements for media
   switching/RTFS device that enable media privacy to be maintained
   across participant endpoints.

   1.  Solution needs to maintain all current SRTP security properties.

   2.  Solution need to extend replay attacks protection to cover cross-
       participants replay prevention.  Packets sent between the media
       switching device and participant A cannot be retransmitted to
       participant B undetected.

   3.  Keys used for encryption and authentication of RTP payloads and
       other information deemed unsuitable for accessibility by the
       media switching device must not be generated by or accessible to
       any of the media switching devices.

   4.  The media switching devices must be capable, if authorized, of
       changing any part of an RTP header except for the RTP sequence
       number and SSRC.  This in turn mandates that the media switching
       devices must have access to the keys used for the authentication
       of RTP header fields other than SSRC and RTP sequence number when
       a proper authorization is in place.

   5.  The SRTP master keys must not be generated by the media switching
       devices

   6.  The media switching devices must not be involved in the
       distribution of the SRTP master keys to participants nor in the
       authentication of the participants identities for the purpose of
       key distribution

   7.  The media switching devices must be able to switch an already
       active SRTP stream to a new receiver while guaranteeing the
       timely synchronization between the SRTP context of the
       transmitter and its old and new receivers.  Of special interest
       is the RoC part pf the SRTP context due to its dynamic nature.
       It is important to note that media switching devices can not
       change RTP sequence numbers as that would require packet re-
       encryption.

6.  Example Scenario

   The above requirements (especially 3 and 4) imply that there is a
   need for SRTP ciphersuites that allow a split key and split
   authentication model.  Instead of the current single SRTP master key,
   this document requires two independent SRTP master keys.  The first

   is an end to end key that is used for the encryption of the RTP
   payload and other information requiring end-to-end encryption.  The
   end to end key is also used for the authentication of the RTP
   payload, the RTP sequence number, RoC and SSRC as well as any other
   information requiring end-to-end authentication.  The second key is
   hop-by-hop key used for the authentication of the RTP packet as well
   as any other information requiring hop by hop authentication (e.g.
   RTCP packet authentication).  The hop-by-hop key can also be used for
   encryption of information that the switch is authorized to access and
   modify, such as encrypted RTCP packets.

   |     Time Stamp      |   |  Auth( RTP Packet + RoC, HopByHopKey )

   |        CSRCs        |   |

   The following figures illustrate how this split-context system could
   be used to accomplish the RTP forwarding objectives above.  We do not
   show the control interactions that would be necessary to distribute
   the requisit keys among the participants.

7.  Security Considerations

   This specification is all about new requirements for a system for
   securing RTP headers separately from the RTP body.

   The requirements discussed above lead to a need for new SRTP cipher
   suites that split protection between hop-by-hop and end-to-end
   protections.  This split may require new models for managing SRTP
   keys, e.g., extensions to DTLS-SRTP or EKT.  We do not address
   requirements for key management in this document, since they would be
   accomplished at the control layer, rather than the RTP forwarding
   layer.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no actions from IANA.
