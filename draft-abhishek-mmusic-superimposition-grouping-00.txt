                 SDP Superimposition Grouping framework
           draft-abhishek-mmusic-superimposition-grouping-00

Abstract

   This document defines semantics that allow for signaling a new SDP
   group "S" for superimposed media in an SDP session.  The "S"
   attribute can be used by the application to relate all the
   superimposed media streams enabling them to be added as an overlay on
   top of any media stream.  The superimposition grouping semantics is
   required, if the media data is separate and transported via different
   sessions.

1.  Introduction

   Media superimposition can be defined to be a visual media
   (video/image/text) which is superimposed on top of an already
   existing visual media such that the resulting foreground and
   background media can be displayed simultaneously.  Superimposition
   can be recursive in that a visual media that is superimposed against
   its background can, in turn, be the background of a another
   superimposed visual media.  The superimposed visual media displayed
   over a background media content may vary in transparency.  Examples
   of video superimposition include real-time multi-party gaming, where
   these superimposed media maybe used to provide additional details or
   stats about each player, or multi-party teleconferencing where visual
   media from users in the teleconference may be superimposed on a
   background media or over each other.  An example is shown in figure
   below, where three foreground media has been superimposed over a
   background media with one foreground media being partly superimposed
   over another foreground media.

                Figure 1: A example of media superimpostion

   SDP is being predominantly used for describing the format for
   multimedia communication sessions.  Many SDP-based systems use open
   standards such as RTP [RFC3550] for media transport and and SIP
   [RFC3261] for session setup and control.  An SDP session may contain
   more than one media description with each media description
   identified by "m"=line.  Each line denotes a single media stream.  If
   multiple visual media lines are present in a session, at present,
   their spatial relationship at the rendering device is undefined.
   This memo introduces a mechanism in which certain rendering
   information becomes available.  The rendering information herein is
   limited to the foreground/background relationship of each grouped
   media vis-a-vis each other, and optionally a transparency value.
   Where, spatially, the media is rendered is not covered by this memo
   and is in many application scenarios a function of the user
   interface.  However, the superimposition grouping as described below
   enables a compliant receiver/renderer implementation to know the
   relative relevance of the visual media as coded by the sender(s) and,
   in a compliant implementation, observed by the renderer through
   superimposition.

   When multiple superimposed streams are transmitted within a session,
   the receiver needs to be able to relate the media streams to each
   other.  This is achieved by the SDP grouping framework [RFC5888] by
   using the "group" attribute that groups different "m" lines in a
   session.  By using a new superimpose group semantic defined in this
   memo, a group's media streams can be uniquely identified across
   multiple SDP descriptions exchanged with different receivers, thereby
   identifying the streams in terms of their role in the session
   irrespective of its media type and transport protocol.  These
   superimposed streams within the group may be multiplexed based on the
   guidelines defined in [draft-ietf-avtcore-multiplex-guidelines-12].

   This document describes a new SDP group semantics for grouping the
   superimposition in an SDP session.  An SDP session description

Internet-Draft       Superimposition Group Semantic        December 2020


   consists of one or multiple media lines know as "m" lines which can
   be identified by a token carried in a "mid" attribute.  The SDP
   session describes a session-level group level attribute that groups
   different media lines using a defined group semantics.  The semantics
   defined in this memo is to be used in conjunction with "The Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework"[RFC5888].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Superimposition Group Identification Attribute

   The "superimposition media stream identification" attribute is used
   to identify the relationship of superimposed media streams within a
   session description.  In a superimposition group, the media lines MAY
   have different media formats.  Its formatting in SDP [RFC4566] is
   described by the following Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234]:

   mid-attribute = "a=mid:" identification-tag
   identification-tag = token
                        ; token is defined in RFC4566

   This documents defines a new group semantics "S" identification media
   attribute, which is used to identify super group media streams within
   a session description.  It is used for grouping the foreground media
   streams to be superimposed on top of a background media stream
   together within a session.  An application that receives a session
   description that contains "m" lines grouped together using "S"
   semantics MUST superimpose the corresponding media streams on top of
   the background media stream.  The ordering of the "m" lines is
   significant: assuming the "m" lines to be counted from 0 to n, for
   each k within 0..n, a reconstructed sample of the k-th media is
   superimposed (while perhaps applying an alpha transparency value) on
   the 0 to k-th reconstructed samples in the same spatial position.

4.  Use of group and mid

   All group and mid attributes MUST follow the rules defined in
   [RFC5888].  The "mid" attribute MUST be used for all "m" lines
   covering visual media within a session description for which a
   foreground/background relationship is to be defined.  The foreground/
   background relationship of visual media within a session description
   that is not covered in a group is undefined.  No more than one group
   MUST be used within one session.  If the identification-tags

Internet-Draft       Superimposition Group Semantic        December 2020


   associated with "a=group" lines do not map to any "m" lines, it MUST
   be ignored.

   group-attribute ="a=group:" semantics
                     *(SP identification-tag)
   semantics = "S" / semantics-extension
   semantics-extension = token
                         ; token is defined in RFC4566

5.  "transparency" Attribute for Superimposition Group Identification
    Attribute

   This memo defines a new media-level attribute, "transparency", with
   the following ABNF [RFC5234].  The identification-tag is defined in
   [RFC5888].

       transparency-attribute =
                    "a=transparency:" transparency-tag
       transparency-tag =tranparency-value *("," tranparency-value) CRLF
       transparency-value= alpha

   Alpha describes the transparency for the foreground media stream.  It
   is identified by its transparency-tag values in the transparency-
   attribute.  It could be an integer with values between 0 and 100.
   This is an informative value.  Details of interpretion to be left
   open to the renderer, expect that a value of 0 means foreground media
   is opaque and value of 100 means that it is transparent.

6.  Example of S

   The following example shows a session description for superimposed
   media stream in an SDP session.  The "group" line indicates that the
   "m" lines with tokens 1 and 2 are grouped for the purpose of
   superimpositon and intended to be overlaid on top of a background
   video.

   In the example shown below, two superimposed media streams are being
   transmitted.  Both media types are video with transparency attribute
   ("transparency").  The current focus of the draft is defining a group
   semantics for superimposed media stream.  The relationship between
   the background and foreground media stream maybe defined in the
   future version of the draft.

7.  Relationship with CLUE (informative)

   Edt. Note: maybe we remove this section later once there is a general
   understanding why CLUE in its current form is unsuitable.  The CLUE
   framework [I-D.ietf-clue-framework] and its associated suite of I-Ds
   and RFCs describe a telepresence framework that, at the first glance
   seems to have a lot in common with the technology proposed herein.
   CLUE defines captures (camera ports), and their geo-spatial
   relationship to each other.  A render can use this information to put
   the reconstructed samples of the streams from the various captures
   into a suitable arrangement such that visually pleasant rendering can
   be achieved.  However, CLUE does not describe the relative relevance
   of the captures.  For that reason, CLUE would need to be extended in
   a spirit very similar to the one described in this memo to achieve
   the desired functionality.  CLUE has not seen wide deployment outside
   its intended key application (large room, multiple camera
   telepresence systems).  It's not reasonable to assume that small
   systems would willingly implement the overhead the (comparatively
   complex) CLUE protocols require when a simple SDP extension can serve
   the same purpose.

8.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations as defined in [RFC5888] apply:

   Using the "group" parameter with FID semantics, an entity that
   managed to modify the session descriptions exchanged between the
   participants to establish a multimedia session could force the
   participants to send a copy of the media to any destination of its
   choosing.

   Integrity mechanisms provided by protocols used to exchange session
   descriptions and media encryption can be used to prevent this attack.
   In SIP, Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)
   [RFC8550] and Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC8446] can be used to

   byhop fashion, respectively.

   This document defines a new SDP group semantics for media
   superimposition for a SDP session.  This attribute can be used by the
   application to group all the foreground media to be superimposed on a
   background media in a session.  Semantics values to be used with this
   framework should be registered by the IANA following the Standards
   Action policy [RFC8126].  This document adds a new group semantics
   and follows the registry group defined in [RFC5888].

   The following semantics needs to be registered by IANA in Semantics
   for the "group" SDP Attribute under SDP Parameters.

   The "S" attribute is used to group different foreground media streams
   to be superimposed on a background media stream .  Its format is
   defined in Section 3.

   The SDP media-level attribute "transparency" needs to be registered
   by IANA Semantics for "att-field (media-level only)".  The
   registration procedure in [RFC4566] applies.
