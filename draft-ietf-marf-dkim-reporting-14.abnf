r= Reporting Requested (plain-text; OPTIONAL; no default).  If
      present, this tag indicates that the Signer requests that
      Verifiers generate a report when verification of the DKIM
      signature fails.  At present, the only legal value is the single
      character "y" (in either upper or lower case).  A complete
      description and illustration of how this is applied can be found
      in Section 3.3.

sig-r-tag = %x72 *WSP "=" *WSP "y"

ra=  Reporting Address (plain-text; OPTIONAL).  A dkim-quoted-
      printable string (see Section 2.11 of [DKIM]) containing the
      local-part of an email address to which a report SHOULD be sent
      when mail fails DKIM verification for one of the reasons
      enumerated below.  The value MUST be interpreted as a local-part
      only.  To construct the actual address to which the report is
      sent, the Verifier simply appends to this value an "@" followed by
      the domain name found in the "d=" tag of the DKIM-Signature header
      field.  Therefore, an ADMD making use of this specification MUST
      ensure that an email address thus constructed can receive reports
      generated as described in Section 6.  ABNF:

rep-ra-tag = %x72.61 *WSP "=" *WSP qp-section

rp=  Requested Report Percentage (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is
      "100").  The value is an integer from 0 to 100 inclusive that
      indicates what percentage of incidents of signature authentication
      failures, selected at random, are to cause reports to be
      generated.  The report generator SHOULD NOT issue reports for more
      than the requested percentage of incidents.  Report generators MAY
      make use of the "Incidents:" field in [ARF] to indicate that there
      are more reportable incidents than there are reports.  ABNF:

rep-rp-tag = %x72.70 *WSP "=" *WSP 1*3DIGIT

rr=  Requested Reports (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "all").  The
      value MUST be a colon-separated list of tokens representing those
      conditions under which a report is desired.  See Section 5.1 for a
      list of valid tags.  ABNF:

rep-rr-type = ( "all" / "d" / "o" / "p"/ "s" / "u" / "v" / "x" )
rep-rr-tag = %x72.72 *WSP "=" *WSP rep-rr-type
                    *WSP 0* ( ":" *WSP rep-rr-type )

rs=  Requested SMTP Error String (text; OPTIONAL; no default).  The
      value is a dkim-quoted-printable string that the publishing ADMD
      requests be included in [SMTP] error strings if messages are
      rejected during the delivery SMTP session.  ABNF:

rep-rs-tag = %x72.73 *WSP "=" qp-section
ra=  Reporting Address (plain-text; OPTIONAL; no default).  The value
      MUST be a dkim-quoted-printable string containing the local-part
      of an email address to which a report SHOULD be sent when mail
      claiming to be from this domain failed the verification algorithm
      described in [ADSP], in particular because a message arrived
      without a signature that validates, which contradicts what the
      ADSP record claims.  The value MUST be interpreted as a local-part
      only.  To construct the actual address to which the report is
      sent, the Verifier simply appends to this value an "@" followed by
      the domain whose policy was queried in order to evaluate the
      sender's ADSP, i.e., the RFC5322.From domain of the message under
      evaluation.  Therefore, a signer making use of this extension tag
      MUST ensure that an email address thus constructed can receive
      reports generated as described in Section 6.  ABNF:

adsp-ra-tag = %x72.61 *WSP "=" qp-section

rp=  Requested Report Percentage (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is
      "100").  The value is a single integer from 0 to 100 inclusive
      that indicates what percentage of incidents of ADSP evaluation
      failures, selected at random, should cause reports to be
      generated.  The report generator SHOULD NOT issue reports for more
      than the requested percentage of incidents.  An exception to this
      might be some out-of-band arrangement between two parties to
      override it with some mutually agreed value.  Report generators
      MAY make use of the "Incidents:" field in [ARF] to indicate that
      there are more reportable incidents than there are reports.  ABNF:

adsp-rp-tag = %x72.70 *WSP "=" *WSP 1*3DIGIT

rr=  Requested Reports (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "all").  The
      value MUST be a colon-separated list of tokens representing those
      conditions under which a report is desired.  See Section 5.2 for a
      list of valid tags.  ABNF:

adsp-rr-type = ( "all" / "o" / "p" / "s" / "u" )
adsp-rr-tag = %x72.72 *WSP "=" *WSP adsp-rr-type
                     *WSP 0* ( ":" *WSP adsp-rr-type )

rs=  Requested SMTP Error String (plain-text; OPTIONAL; no default).
      The value is a string the signing domain requests be included in
      [SMTP] error strings when messages are rejected during a single
      SMTP session.  ABNF:

adsp-rs-tag = %x72.73 *WSP "=" qp-section
