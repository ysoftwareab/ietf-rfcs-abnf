1.  Introduction

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] records OAM information within user packets
   while the packets traverse a network.  The data types and data
   formats for IOAM data records have been defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  The IOAM data can be embedded in many
   protocol encapsulations such as Network Services Header (NSH) and
   IPv6.

   This document defines a data model for IOAM capabilities using the
   YANG data modeling language [RFC7950].  This YANG model supports all
   the five IOAM options, which are Incremental Tracing Option, Pre-
   allocated Tracing Option, Direct Export
   Option[I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export], Proof of Transit(PoT)
   Option, and Edge-to-Edge Option.

   BCP14, [RFC2119], [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950] and are used in this
   specification:

   o  augment

   o  data model

   o  data node

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950].

2.1.  Tree Diagrams

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

3.  Design of the IOAM YANG Data Model

3.1.  Profiles

   The IOAM model is organized as list of profiles as shown in the
   following figure.  Each profile associates with one flow and the
   corresponding IOAM information.

   The "ioam-info" is a container for all the read only assistant
   information such as units or timestamp format.  So that monitoring
   systems can interpret the IOAM data.

   The "enabled" is an administrative configuration.  When it is set to
   true, IOAM configuration is enabled for the system.  Meanwhile, the
   IOAM data-plane functionality is enabled.

   The "filter" is used to identify a flow, where the IOAM profile can
   apply.  There may be multiple filter types.  ACL [RFC8519] is a
   common way to specify a flow.  Each IOAM profile can associate with
   an ACE(Access Control Entry).  IOAM actions MUST be driven by the
   accepted packets, when the matched ACE "forwarding" action is
   "accept".

   The IOAM data can be encapsulated into multiple protocols, e.g., IPv6
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-ipv6-options] and NSH [I-D.ietf-sfc-ioam-nsh].
   The "protocol-type" is used to indicate where the IOAM is applied.
   For example, if the "protocol-type" is IPv6, the IOAM ingress node
   will encapsulate the associated flow with the IPv6-IOAM
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-ipv6-options] format.

   IOAM data includes five encapsulation types, i.e., incremental
   tracing data, preallocated tracing data, direct export data, prove of
   transit data and end to end data.  In practice, multiple IOAM data
   types can be encapsulated into the same IOAM header.  The "ioam-
   profile" contains a set of sub-profiles, each of which relates to one
   encapsulation type.  The configured object may not support all the
   sub-profiles.  The supported sub-profiles are indicated by 5 defined

   features, i.e., "incremental-trace", "preallocated-trace", "direct
   export", "proof-of-transit", "edge-to-edge".

3.2.  Preallocated Tracing Profile

   The IOAM tracing data is expected to be collected at every node that
   a packet traverses to ensure visibility into the entire path a packet
   takes within an IOAM domain.  The preallocated tracing option will
   create pre-allocated space for each node to populate its information
   . The "preallocated-tracing-profile" contains the detailed
   information for the preallocated tracing data.  The information
   includes:

   o  enabled: indicates whether the preallocated tracing profile is
      enabled.

   o  node-action: indicates the operation (e.g., encapsulate IOAM
      header, transit the IOAM data, or decapsulate IOAM header) applied
      to the dedicated flow.

   o  use-namespace: indicate the namespace used for the trace types.

   o  trace-type: indicates the per-hop data to be captured by the IOAM
      enabled nodes and included in the node data list.

   o  Loopback mode is used to send a copy of a packet back towards the
      source.

   o  Active mode indicates that a packet is used for active
      measurement.

      +--rw enabled?                boolean
      +--rw node-action?            ioam-node-action

      +--rw enable-loopback-mode?   boolean
      +--rw enable-active-mode?   boolean

3.3.  Incremental Tracing Profile

   The incremental tracing option contains a variable node data fields
   where each node allocates and pushes its node data immediately
   following the option header.  The "incremental-tracing-profile"
   contains the detailed information for the incremental tracing data.
   The detailed information is the same as the Preallocated Tracing

   the length of the IOAM header.

      +--rw enable-active-mode?   boolean
      +--rw max-length?             uint32

3.4.  Direct Export Profile

   The direct export option is used as a trigger for IOAM nodes to
   export IOAM data to a receiving entity (or entities).  The "direct-
   export-profile" contains the detailed information for the direct
   export data.  The detailed information is the same as the
   Preallocated Tracing Profile, but with one more optional variable,
   "flow-id", which is used to correlate the exported data of the same
   flow from multiple nodes and from multiple packets.

   +--rw direct-export-profile {direct-export}?
      +--rw enabled?                boolean

      +--rw enable-active-mode?   boolean
      +--rw flow-id?             uint32

3.5.  Proof of Transit Profile

   The IOAM Proof of Transit data is to support the path or service
   function chain verification use cases.  The "pot-profile" contains
   the detailed information for the prove of transit data.  The detailed
   information are described in [I-D.ietf-sfc-proof-of-transit].

            +--rw upstream-mask*     uint64

3.6.  Edge to Edge Profile

   The IOAM edge to edge option is to carry data that is added by the
   IOAM encapsulating node and interpreted by IOAM decapsulating node.
   The "e2e-profile" contains the detailed information for the edge to
   edge data.  The detailed information includes:

   o  enabled: indicates whether the edge to edge profile is enabled.

   o  node-action is the same semantic as in Section 2.2.

   o  use-namespace: indicate the namespace used for the edge to edge
      types.

   o  e2e-type indicates data to be carried from the ingress IOAM node
      to the egress IOAM node.

   +--rw e2e-profile {edge-to-edge}?
      +--rw enabled?       boolean
      +--rw node-action?   ioam-node-action
      +--rw e2e-types

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a

   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /ioam/ioam-profiles/admin-config

   The items in the container above include the top level administrative
   configurations related to the IOAM functionalities and all the IOAM
   profiles.  Unexpected changes to these items could lead to the IOAM
   function disruption and/ or misbehavior of all the IOAM profiles.

   o  /ioam/ioam-profiles/ioam-profile

   The entries in the list above include the whole IOAM profile
   configurations which indirectly create or modify the device
   configurations.  Unexpected changes to these entries could lead to
   the mistake of the IOAM behavior for the corresponding flows.

6.  IANA Considerations

   RFC Ed.: In this section, replace all occurrences of 'XXXX' with the
   actual RFC number (and remove this note).

   IANA is requested to assign a new URI from the IETF XML Registry
   [RFC3688].  The following URI is suggested:

           URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ioam
           Registrant Contact: The IESG.
           XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document also requests a new YANG module name in the YANG Module
   Names registry [RFC7950] with the following suggestion:

           name: ietf-ioam
           namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ioam
           prefix: ioam
           reference: RFC XXXX
